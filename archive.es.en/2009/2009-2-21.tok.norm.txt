not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .
20 , but did n't make it far .
after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .
once again , he made it through the camp gates , but not without being spotted by british military police .
well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "
the local police have opened an investigation .

the board represents several government ministries as well as the federal states where opel owns factories . opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated . bild also reported that additional losses expected up to 2011 would create new capital requirements of 1.1 billion euro . an economics ministry spokesperson refused to confirm the report , saying the government panel discussions were confidential .
the spokesperson added that there was presently no draft document which made it possible to evaluate what assistance might be necessary or available . according to bild , only a rescue guarantee package could help opel in the short term .
eu legislation specifies that , in return , the company would need to commit to huge cuts in staff and production capacity . opel confirmed friday that it will need greater state guarantees than requested to date but would not specify the amount . state bail out possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could opel be the next recipient of german bailout billions ?
the german government has said opel required a total of 3.3 billion euros in state guarantees , according to weekly spiegel magazine .

" german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is also the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in september 's national elections , said a state bailout could it could be an option , particularly if the german carmaker breaks off from its troubled american parent company . " we currently can not be sure whether this will be the case , " steinmeier said .
" but with the information that we ’ re getting from gm in the us , it seems as if there is a chance for a greater independence of the european subsidiaries . " saab 's suffering sweden 's saab , one of gm 's other european brands , made a de facto split from the us automaker by filing for bankruptcy protection .
in a plan submitted to the us treasury , gm said the swedish firm would become an independent business as of the beginning of 2010 . the swedish government , however , said it was not prepared to guarantee loans gm said would be necessary to turn saab around . saab said friday that a court-appointed administrator would use the following three months to reorganize the company and search for additional sources of funding . dw staf -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board represents several government ministries as well as the federal states where opel owns factories . opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated . bild also reported that additional losses expected up to 2011 would create new capital requirements of 1.1 billion euro . an economics ministry spokesperson refused to confirm the report , saying the government panel discussions were confidential .
the spokesperson added that there was presently no draft document which made it possible to evaluate what assistance might be necessary or available . according to bild , only a rescue guarantee package could help opel in the short term .
eu legislation specifies that , in return , the company would need to commit to huge cuts in staff and production capacity . opel confirmed friday that it will need greater state guarantees than requested to date but would not specify the amount . state bail out possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could opel be the next recipient of german bailout billions ?
the german government has said opel required a total of 3.3 billion euros in state guarantees , according to weekly spiegel magazine .

" it 's entirely clear that -lrb- opel -rrb- can not become a bottomless hole , " an unnamed source told reuters news agency .
" when you talk about a plan , then there must be one sum that can sustain a business model until time ' x ' without any ifs , ands or buts . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is also the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in september 's national elections , said a state bailout could it could be an option , particularly if the german carmaker breaks off from its troubled american parent company . " we currently can not be sure whether this will be the case , " steinmeier said .
" but with the information that we ’ re getting from gm in the us , it seems as if there is a chance for a greater independence of the european subsidiaries . " saab 's suffering sweden 's saab , one of gm 's other european brands , made a de facto split from the us automaker by filing for bankruptcy protection .
in a plan submitted to the us treasury , gm said the swedish firm would become an independent business as of the beginning of 2010 . the swedish government , however , said it was not prepared to guarantee loans gm said would be necessary to turn saab around . saab said friday that a court-appointed administrator would use the following three months to reorganize the company and search for additional sources of funding . dw staf -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she hopes to forge a common european stance before a g20 summit in april . there could no longer be blank spots where regulations do n't apply in the wake of the financial meltdown , merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday , feb .
21 . " we want to make sure that in the future there are no gaps in the world regarding financial products , market participants or instruments , " she said . the german finance ministry also presented saturday a summary paper , reflecting the main changes to the global financial system that germany would like to see the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- major economic powers make at its summit on april 2 in london . germany is set to welcome sunday leaders britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers for a planning meeting ahead of the london summit . british prime minister gordon brown wrote to european leaders this week setting out areas where he thought they could take action before the g20 summit . " the eu should be using its influence to build an international consensus behind the necessary action that the international community has got to take , " brown 's spokesman told reuters news agency .

" i will not associate myself to a position that does not give an ambitious response to this deep crisis , " he told reporters on saturday . a summary document issued by german finance minister peer steinbrueck reflects the level of agreement to date between european finance ministers .
highlighting germany 's priorities for the g20 summit , steinbrueck 's notes back up merkel 's message that no financial market , product or stakeholder should remain unregulated . the document stresses transparency and accountability measures aimed at reining in some of the worst excesses of the financial system before the current bust . bonus limits for managers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managers should be pocketing bonuses for taking on too much risk , politicians said steinbrueck 's paper calls for , among other measures , an obligation for the originator of any security to retain at least 5 percent of risk - in response to the complex and unaccountable reselling of mortgages and other debt which caused the financial system to implode in 2008 . the document also calls for registration of hedge funds to be " imposed " and for the external regulation of hedge funds . steinbrueck has called for curbs on executive pay , to avoid " excessive risk taking and focus on the short term .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .

an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .
this meeting now looks set to turn into an opportunity to lambast sarkozy over his recent proposals .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust .

" to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .

" iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west .

that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable .

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .
20 , but did n't make it far .
after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .
once again , he made it through the camp gates , but not without being spotted by british military police .
well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "
the local police have opened an investigation .
there was no word on how many push-ups the soldier will have to do as punishment when his hangover wears off . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .

" iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as perpetrators are featured in the latest crop of movies based on a book by stefan aust that was first published in 1985 , but only recently translated into english , the german film is facing off movies from france , israel , japan and austria in the battle for the coveted prize .
but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .

this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .

austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .
" the baader-meinhof complex " deals with events that rocked west germany a generation later .
nevertheless , it has been about 30 years since the peak of the guerrilla movement 's activities , which presented a major challenge to the nation 's fledgling post-war democracy .
unfolding story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this chapter in german history is more than just a fading memory the story of the raf 's campaign , however , continues to unfold .
only in the last two years has it emerged that the raf in the 1970s planned to abduct west german chancellor willy brandt and fashion designer karl lagerfeld .
and former faction members also continue to hit the headlines in germany .
one of the movement 's leaders , christian klar , was released from jail in december - just months after another raf fighter , brigitte mohnhaupt , was set free .
this leaves only one raf member still behind bars : birgit hogefeld , 52 , also a one-time leader of the group , which was disbanded in 1998 .
the recent releases are controversial partly because it still remains unclear who was actually responsible for some of the group 's more high-profile murders , including the gunning down of german employers ' federation president hanns martin schleyer . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's just the latest in a string of productions that deal with the nation 's recent past . uli edel 's " the baader-meinhof complex " is one of five films nominated for best foreign language film at the academy awards in los angeles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as perpetrators are featured in the latest crop of movies based on a book by stefan aust that was first published in 1985 , but only recently translated into english , the german film is facing off movies from france , israel , japan and austria in the battle for the coveted prize .
but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .
" you are a fascist asshole , " the andreas baader character screams at one of the judges in edel 's film .

this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .
berlinale successes for german cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maren ade showed off her silver bear as a further sign of the current strength of german cinema , the berlin international film festival last week awarded german director maren ade a special jury prize for her movie " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- .
austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .
" the baader-meinhof complex " deals with events that rocked west germany a generation later .
nevertheless , it has been about 30 years since the peak of the guerrilla movement 's activities , which presented a major challenge to the nation 's fledgling post-war democracy .
unfolding story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this chapter in german history is more than just a fading memory the story of the raf 's campaign , however , continues to unfold .
only in the last two years has it emerged that the raf in the 1970s planned to abduct west german chancellor willy brandt and fashion designer karl lagerfeld .
and former faction members also continue to hit the headlines in germany .
one of the movement 's leaders , christian klar , was released from jail in december - just months after another raf fighter , brigitte mohnhaupt , was set free .
this leaves only one raf member still behind bars : birgit hogefeld , 52 , also a one-time leader of the group , which was disbanded in 1998 .
the recent releases are controversial partly because it still remains unclear who was actually responsible for some of the group 's more high-profile murders , including the gunning down of german employers ' federation president hanns martin schleyer . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bayern were looking to bounce back from last saturday 's 2-1 defeat at hertha , and had cologne-bound lukas podolski back in the side in the absence of injured italy striker luca toni . podolski , however , only lasted the first half before being replaced by us striker landon donovan . miroslav klose thought he had headed bayern in front only to be ruled out - wrongly as television pictures showed - for offside . cologne then caught the home side out in the 22nd minute when nemanja vucicevic threaded a ball through to fabrice ehret for the french midfielder to finish neatly with the outside of his left foot . a further shock came 12 minutes later when daniel brosinski netted in front of goal , with vucicevic again the provider after getting past philipp lahm on the right before sending in a low cross . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , will be in a cologne jersey next season belgian defender daniel van buyten headed bayern back in contention six minutes from time but cologne held on for the three points .

the draw continued stuttgart 's unbeaten streak , which runs back to november . " the spectators certainly got their money 's worth today , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick .
" it was an intense game which would we could have won , albeit unexpectedly .
we can live with 3-3 . " the tie came for hoffenheim just after the german soccer federation said it would look into doping violations by hoffenheim players andreas ibertsberger and christoph janker .

" we are , of course , very disappointed , because we could have taken at least a point , " said hertha coach lucien favre .
" in the second-half , we were actually the better team and we made wolfsburg look strong , so it 's hard to accept this defeat . " bottom club borussia moenchengladbach ended a run of eight games without a win by downing hanover 3-2 . first-half goals from alexander baumjohann and marko marin and a late winner from oliver neuville gave borussia the points after sergio pinto and christian schulz had hit back for the visitors . a last-minute goal from dimitar rangelov gave energie cottbus a 2-1 win over ailing werder bremen to lift the eastern german club out of the relegation zone . struggling arminia bielefeld and bochum finished 1-1 , while second-to-bottom karlsruhe slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to eintracht frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .

this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .

austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .

"
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "

as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "

hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .
this meeting now looks set to turn into an opportunity to lambast sarkozy over his recent proposals .

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .

after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .

well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries . " the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said . nuclear program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western nations have said iran is developing nuclear weapons an international dispute over iran 's nuclear program is one of the issues tehran was hoping to discuss with the former chancellor . iran 's parliamentary speaker ali larijani addressed on saturday told schroeder that it is impossible to deprive tehran of nuclear technology for peaceful uses . " iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .
in january he added " if countries like iran are willing to unclench their fists , they will find an extended hand from us . " dw staff -lrb- tt / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries . " the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said . nuclear program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western nations have said iran is developing nuclear weapons an international dispute over iran 's nuclear program is one of the issues tehran was hoping to discuss with the former chancellor . iran 's parliamentary speaker ali larijani addressed on saturday told schroeder that it is impossible to deprive tehran of nuclear technology for peaceful uses . " iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .
in january he added " if countries like iran are willing to unclench their fists , they will find an extended hand from us . " dw staff -lrb- tt / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hamburg could take the lead on sunday . demba ba scored a hat-trick for hoffenheim who missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw at vfb stuttgart - the point enough to put ralf rangnick 's side back on top on goal difference . the results could benefit third-placed sv hamburg who will go top if they can win at fifth-placed bayer leverkusen on sunday . midtable cologne boosted the weekend 's carnival celebrations in the city by handing juergen klinsmann 's bayern side a third defeat in four games since the winter break . it leaves bayern fourth on 38 points , two adrift of hoffenheim and hertha berlin ahead of a visit to werder bremen next weekend . bayern 's blues drag on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : underdogs cologne had plenty to celebrate against bayern bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge had a similarly disappointed view of his team 's match against cologne . " we had a bad day and we were caught ice cold on the break , " he said .
" we had bad luck with a disallowed goal but you have to say we did n't play well and did n't look good defensively . " bayern were looking to bounce back from last saturday 's 2-1 defeat at hertha , and had cologne-bound lukas podolski back in the side in the absence of injured italy striker luca toni . podolski , however , only lasted the first half before being replaced by us striker landon donovan . miroslav klose thought he had headed bayern in front only to be ruled out - wrongly as television pictures showed - for offside . cologne then caught the home side out in the 22nd minute when nemanja vucicevic threaded a ball through to fabrice ehret for the french midfielder to finish neatly with the outside of his left foot . a further shock came 12 minutes later when daniel brosinski netted in front of goal , with vucicevic again the provider after getting past philipp lahm on the right before sending in a low cross . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , will be in a cologne jersey next season belgian defender daniel van buyten headed bayern back in contention six minutes from time but cologne held on for the three points . " we played with a lot of heart and had that little bit of luck you need in certain situations , " cologne coach christoph daum said . three players , six goals in stuttgart demba ba scored all three goals for hoffenheim , while mario gomez hit two for stuttgart as the two sides shared six goals .
but the visitors missed a golden opportunity for victory when sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from the penalty spot in stoppage time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demba ba put his name next to all three of hoffenheim 's goals senegalese striker ba opened the scoring in the 24th minute and hit a second just before half-time after cacau and mario gomez had struck for the home side . gomez then put stuttgart in front with a clever goal lob in the 63rd minute only for ba to strike again four minutes later .

but hamburg could take the lead on sunday . demba ba scored a hat-trick for hoffenheim who missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw at vfb stuttgart - the point enough to put ralf rangnick 's side back on top on goal difference . the results could benefit third-placed sv hamburg who will go top if they can win at fifth-placed bayer leverkusen on sunday . midtable cologne boosted the weekend 's carnival celebrations in the city by handing juergen klinsmann 's bayern side a third defeat in four games since the winter break . it leaves bayern fourth on 38 points , two adrift of hoffenheim and hertha berlin ahead of a visit to werder bremen next weekend . bayern 's blues drag on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : underdogs cologne had plenty to celebrate against bayern bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge had a similarly disappointed view of his team 's match against cologne .

" we had bad luck with a disallowed goal but you have to say we did n't play well and did n't look good defensively . " bayern were looking to bounce back from last saturday 's 2-1 defeat at hertha , and had cologne-bound lukas podolski back in the side in the absence of injured italy striker luca toni . podolski , however , only lasted the first half before being replaced by us striker landon donovan . miroslav klose thought he had headed bayern in front only to be ruled out - wrongly as television pictures showed - for offside . cologne then caught the home side out in the 22nd minute when nemanja vucicevic threaded a ball through to fabrice ehret for the french midfielder to finish neatly with the outside of his left foot . a further shock came 12 minutes later when daniel brosinski netted in front of goal , with vucicevic again the provider after getting past philipp lahm on the right before sending in a low cross . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , will be in a cologne jersey next season belgian defender daniel van buyten headed bayern back in contention six minutes from time but cologne held on for the three points . " we played with a lot of heart and had that little bit of luck you need in certain situations , " cologne coach christoph daum said . three players , six goals in stuttgart demba ba scored all three goals for hoffenheim , while mario gomez hit two for stuttgart as the two sides shared six goals .
but the visitors missed a golden opportunity for victory when sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from the penalty spot in stoppage time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demba ba put his name next to all three of hoffenheim 's goals senegalese striker ba opened the scoring in the 24th minute and hit a second just before half-time after cacau and mario gomez had struck for the home side . gomez then put stuttgart in front with a clever goal lob in the 63rd minute only for ba to strike again four minutes later .
the draw continued stuttgart 's unbeaten streak , which runs back to november . " the spectators certainly got their money 's worth today , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick .
" it was an intense game which would we could have won , albeit unexpectedly .

she hopes to forge a common european stance before a g20 summit in april . there could no longer be blank spots where regulations do n't apply in the wake of the financial meltdown , merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday , feb .
21 . " we want to make sure that in the future there are no gaps in the world regarding financial products , market participants or instruments , " she said . the german finance ministry also presented saturday a summary paper , reflecting the main changes to the global financial system that germany would like to see the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- major economic powers make at its summit on april 2 in london . germany is set to welcome sunday leaders britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers for a planning meeting ahead of the london summit . british prime minister gordon brown wrote to european leaders this week setting out areas where he thought they could take action before the g20 summit . " the eu should be using its influence to build an international consensus behind the necessary action that the international community has got to take , " brown 's spokesman told reuters news agency .
" we need to continue to provide fiscal stimulus to our national economies and ensure those are coordinated . " european agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin talks aim to forge a european position before g20 leaders meet the chancellor , criticized last year for being slow to match british and french national rescue plans , said new unified rules must apply to all financial market products , financial instruments and market participants . french president nicolas sarkozy , accused by some in the european union giving unfair aid to domestic carmakers , said europe should unite behind bold measures to fight the ongoing financial crisis .

highlighting germany 's priorities for the g20 summit , steinbrueck 's notes back up merkel 's message that no financial market , product or stakeholder should remain unregulated . the document stresses transparency and accountability measures aimed at reining in some of the worst excesses of the financial system before the current bust . bonus limits for managers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managers should be pocketing bonuses for taking on too much risk , politicians said steinbrueck 's paper calls for , among other measures , an obligation for the originator of any security to retain at least 5 percent of risk - in response to the complex and unaccountable reselling of mortgages and other debt which caused the financial system to implode in 2008 . the document also calls for registration of hedge funds to be " imposed " and for the external regulation of hedge funds . steinbrueck has called for curbs on executive pay , to avoid " excessive risk taking and focus on the short term . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso has also called for placing limits on bankers ' bonuses . " the payment of excessive bonuses incites financial managers to take ill-considered risks , " barroso told the german daily hamburger abendblatt in remarks published saturday . atlas of risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an atlas of risk would likely make for some dark reading merkel said germany was " very well prepared " for sunday 's meeting .
a group of experts chaired by a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , otmar issing , had made several suggestions , she added . these include a map listing the risks faced by financial institutions operating worldwide , reflected in steinbrueck 's preparatory document , in which he calls for the establishment of " effective early warning mechanisms . " merkel said the g20 was working with " high pressure " on the implementation of a plan of action agreed at the group 's last meeting in november . at the london meeting , merkel expected the group to take " a significant step forward in implementing these measures .

she hopes to forge a common european stance before a g20 summit in april . there could no longer be blank spots where regulations do n't apply in the wake of the financial meltdown , merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday , feb .
21 . " we want to make sure that in the future there are no gaps in the world regarding financial products , market participants or instruments , " she said . the german finance ministry also presented saturday a summary paper , reflecting the main changes to the global financial system that germany would like to see the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- major economic powers make at its summit on april 2 in london . germany is set to welcome sunday leaders britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers for a planning meeting ahead of the london summit . british prime minister gordon brown wrote to european leaders this week setting out areas where he thought they could take action before the g20 summit . " the eu should be using its influence to build an international consensus behind the necessary action that the international community has got to take , " brown 's spokesman told reuters news agency .
" we need to continue to provide fiscal stimulus to our national economies and ensure those are coordinated . " european agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin talks aim to forge a european position before g20 leaders meet the chancellor , criticized last year for being slow to match british and french national rescue plans , said new unified rules must apply to all financial market products , financial instruments and market participants . french president nicolas sarkozy , accused by some in the european union giving unfair aid to domestic carmakers , said europe should unite behind bold measures to fight the ongoing financial crisis . " i will not associate myself to a position that does not give an ambitious response to this deep crisis , " he told reporters on saturday . a summary document issued by german finance minister peer steinbrueck reflects the level of agreement to date between european finance ministers .
highlighting germany 's priorities for the g20 summit , steinbrueck 's notes back up merkel 's message that no financial market , product or stakeholder should remain unregulated . the document stresses transparency and accountability measures aimed at reining in some of the worst excesses of the financial system before the current bust . bonus limits for managers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managers should be pocketing bonuses for taking on too much risk , politicians said steinbrueck 's paper calls for , among other measures , an obligation for the originator of any security to retain at least 5 percent of risk - in response to the complex and unaccountable reselling of mortgages and other debt which caused the financial system to implode in 2008 . the document also calls for registration of hedge funds to be " imposed " and for the external regulation of hedge funds . steinbrueck has called for curbs on executive pay , to avoid " excessive risk taking and focus on the short term . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso has also called for placing limits on bankers ' bonuses . " the payment of excessive bonuses incites financial managers to take ill-considered risks , " barroso told the german daily hamburger abendblatt in remarks published saturday . atlas of risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an atlas of risk would likely make for some dark reading merkel said germany was " very well prepared " for sunday 's meeting .
a group of experts chaired by a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , otmar issing , had made several suggestions , she added . these include a map listing the risks faced by financial institutions operating worldwide , reflected in steinbrueck 's preparatory document , in which he calls for the establishment of " effective early warning mechanisms . " merkel said the g20 was working with " high pressure " on the implementation of a plan of action agreed at the group 's last meeting in november . at the london meeting , merkel expected the group to take " a significant step forward in implementing these measures . " " on sunday we will take preparatory measures to appear united and ambitious in london , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "

gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .

based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .

" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "

gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .

21 . " we want to make sure that in the future there are no gaps in the world regarding financial products , market participants or instruments , " she said . the german finance ministry also presented saturday a summary paper , reflecting the main changes to the global financial system that germany would like to see the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- major economic powers make at its summit on april 2 in london . germany is set to welcome sunday leaders britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers for a planning meeting ahead of the london summit . british prime minister gordon brown wrote to european leaders this week setting out areas where he thought they could take action before the g20 summit . " the eu should be using its influence to build an international consensus behind the necessary action that the international community has got to take , " brown 's spokesman told reuters news agency .

" european commission chief jose manuel barroso has also called for placing limits on bankers ' bonuses . " the payment of excessive bonuses incites financial managers to take ill-considered risks , " barroso told the german daily hamburger abendblatt in remarks published saturday . atlas of risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an atlas of risk would likely make for some dark reading merkel said germany was " very well prepared " for sunday 's meeting .

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .

" iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west .

that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .

after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .
once again , he made it through the camp gates , but not without being spotted by british military police .
well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .

other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican .

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries . " the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said . nuclear program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western nations have said iran is developing nuclear weapons an international dispute over iran 's nuclear program is one of the issues tehran was hoping to discuss with the former chancellor . iran 's parliamentary speaker ali larijani addressed on saturday told schroeder that it is impossible to deprive tehran of nuclear technology for peaceful uses . " iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries . " the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said . nuclear program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western nations have said iran is developing nuclear weapons an international dispute over iran 's nuclear program is one of the issues tehran was hoping to discuss with the former chancellor . iran 's parliamentary speaker ali larijani addressed on saturday told schroeder that it is impossible to deprive tehran of nuclear technology for peaceful uses . " iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .
in january he added " if countries like iran are willing to unclench their fists , they will find an extended hand from us . " dw staff -lrb- tt / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .

well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "

but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "

this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .

hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .
this meeting now looks set to turn into an opportunity to lambast sarkozy over his recent proposals .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable .

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .
20 , but did n't make it far .
after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .
once again , he made it through the camp gates , but not without being spotted by british military police .
well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "
the local police have opened an investigation .
there was no word on how many push-ups the soldier will have to do as punishment when his hangover wears off . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ubs employees could face " substantial prison terms as well as fines , penalties and other sanctions , " they said . in addition , compliance with the demands made in the suit filed on wednesday on behalf of the us international revenue service would force ubs " to violate swiss law in a manner that will expose it to penalties , civil liability and the possible revocation of its banking license , " continued the lawyers . friday 's temporary court ruling halts the future transfer of data until a petition brought by eight bank clients was heard and ubs and others were able to make their statements to the judges . the clients claim there is no legal basis for transferring their data and that such a move would cause them harm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has particularly strict laws on sharing bank data with third parties some experts say the case , a new step in the growing global fight against tax evasion , opens cracks in the country 's longstanding bank secrecy laws . the tradition of swiss banking secrecy dates back to legislation from 1934 .

it has announced job cuts and taken a $ 58-billion bailout from the swiss government . ubs was not the only financial institution to do fairy poorly on the stock market friday .

it 's just the latest in a string of productions that deal with the nation 's recent past . uli edel 's " the baader-meinhof complex " is one of five films nominated for best foreign language film at the academy awards in los angeles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as perpetrators are featured in the latest crop of movies based on a book by stefan aust that was first published in 1985 , but only recently translated into english , the german film is facing off movies from france , israel , japan and austria in the battle for the coveted prize .
but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .
" you are a fascist asshole , " the andreas baader character screams at one of the judges in edel 's film .
second time around for leading lady bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's martina gedeck 's second oscar outing starring leading german actors martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu as the two founders of the group , ulrike meinhof and andreas baader , the movie premiered last autumn .
this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .
berlinale successes for german cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maren ade showed off her silver bear as a further sign of the current strength of german cinema , the berlin international film festival last week awarded german director maren ade a special jury prize for her movie " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- .
austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .
" the baader-meinhof complex " deals with events that rocked west germany a generation later .
nevertheless , it has been about 30 years since the peak of the guerrilla movement 's activities , which presented a major challenge to the nation 's fledgling post-war democracy .
unfolding story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this chapter in german history is more than just a fading memory the story of the raf 's campaign , however , continues to unfold .
only in the last two years has it emerged that the raf in the 1970s planned to abduct west german chancellor willy brandt and fashion designer karl lagerfeld .
and former faction members also continue to hit the headlines in germany .
one of the movement 's leaders , christian klar , was released from jail in december - just months after another raf fighter , brigitte mohnhaupt , was set free .
this leaves only one raf member still behind bars : birgit hogefeld , 52 , also a one-time leader of the group , which was disbanded in 1998 .
the recent releases are controversial partly because it still remains unclear who was actually responsible for some of the group 's more high-profile murders , including the gunning down of german employers ' federation president hanns martin schleyer . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .
this meeting now looks set to turn into an opportunity to lambast sarkozy over his recent proposals .
as the french president 's international approval ratings drop , this may give merkel an opportunity to regain a key european role . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bank 's lawyers said complying with the us would be very costly . ubs ' lawyers said friday , feb .

ubs employees could face " substantial prison terms as well as fines , penalties and other sanctions , " they said . in addition , compliance with the demands made in the suit filed on wednesday on behalf of the us international revenue service would force ubs " to violate swiss law in a manner that will expose it to penalties , civil liability and the possible revocation of its banking license , " continued the lawyers . friday 's temporary court ruling halts the future transfer of data until a petition brought by eight bank clients was heard and ubs and others were able to make their statements to the judges . the clients claim there is no legal basis for transferring their data and that such a move would cause them harm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has particularly strict laws on sharing bank data with third parties some experts say the case , a new step in the growing global fight against tax evasion , opens cracks in the country 's longstanding bank secrecy laws . the tradition of swiss banking secrecy dates back to legislation from 1934 .

21 . " we want to make sure that in the future there are no gaps in the world regarding financial products , market participants or instruments , " she said . the german finance ministry also presented saturday a summary paper , reflecting the main changes to the global financial system that germany would like to see the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- major economic powers make at its summit on april 2 in london . germany is set to welcome sunday leaders britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers for a planning meeting ahead of the london summit . british prime minister gordon brown wrote to european leaders this week setting out areas where he thought they could take action before the g20 summit .

21 .
the board represents several government ministries as well as the federal states where opel owns factories . opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated . bild also reported that additional losses expected up to 2011 would create new capital requirements of 1.1 billion euro . an economics ministry spokesperson refused to confirm the report , saying the government panel discussions were confidential .
the spokesperson added that there was presently no draft document which made it possible to evaluate what assistance might be necessary or available . according to bild , only a rescue guarantee package could help opel in the short term .
eu legislation specifies that , in return , the company would need to commit to huge cuts in staff and production capacity . opel confirmed friday that it will need greater state guarantees than requested to date but would not specify the amount . state bail out possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could opel be the next recipient of german bailout billions ?
the german government has said opel required a total of 3.3 billion euros in state guarantees , according to weekly spiegel magazine .

" it 's entirely clear that -lrb- opel -rrb- can not become a bottomless hole , " an unnamed source told reuters news agency .
" when you talk about a plan , then there must be one sum that can sustain a business model until time ' x ' without any ifs , ands or buts . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is also the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in september 's national elections , said a state bailout could it could be an option , particularly if the german carmaker breaks off from its troubled american parent company . " we currently can not be sure whether this will be the case , " steinmeier said .
" but with the information that we ’ re getting from gm in the us , it seems as if there is a chance for a greater independence of the european subsidiaries . " saab 's suffering sweden 's saab , one of gm 's other european brands , made a de facto split from the us automaker by filing for bankruptcy protection .
in a plan submitted to the us treasury , gm said the swedish firm would become an independent business as of the beginning of 2010 . the swedish government , however , said it was not prepared to guarantee loans gm said would be necessary to turn saab around . saab said friday that a court-appointed administrator would use the following three months to reorganize the company and search for additional sources of funding . dw staf -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 .
the board represents several government ministries as well as the federal states where opel owns factories . opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated . bild also reported that additional losses expected up to 2011 would create new capital requirements of 1.1 billion euro . an economics ministry spokesperson refused to confirm the report , saying the government panel discussions were confidential .
the spokesperson added that there was presently no draft document which made it possible to evaluate what assistance might be necessary or available . according to bild , only a rescue guarantee package could help opel in the short term .
eu legislation specifies that , in return , the company would need to commit to huge cuts in staff and production capacity . opel confirmed friday that it will need greater state guarantees than requested to date but would not specify the amount . state bail out possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could opel be the next recipient of german bailout billions ?
the german government has said opel required a total of 3.3 billion euros in state guarantees , according to weekly spiegel magazine .
previously , the car manufacturer had requested 1.8 billion euros of state securities . news of the higher funding needs could weaken political supporters who have argued for extending guarantees . " it 's entirely clear that -lrb- opel -rrb- can not become a bottomless hole , " an unnamed source told reuters news agency .
" when you talk about a plan , then there must be one sum that can sustain a business model until time ' x ' without any ifs , ands or buts . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is also the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in september 's national elections , said a state bailout could it could be an option , particularly if the german carmaker breaks off from its troubled american parent company . " we currently can not be sure whether this will be the case , " steinmeier said .
" but with the information that we ’ re getting from gm in the us , it seems as if there is a chance for a greater independence of the european subsidiaries . " saab 's suffering sweden 's saab , one of gm 's other european brands , made a de facto split from the us automaker by filing for bankruptcy protection .
in a plan submitted to the us treasury , gm said the swedish firm would become an independent business as of the beginning of 2010 . the swedish government , however , said it was not prepared to guarantee loans gm said would be necessary to turn saab around . saab said friday that a court-appointed administrator would use the following three months to reorganize the company and search for additional sources of funding . dw staf -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she hopes to forge a common european stance before a g20 summit in april . there could no longer be blank spots where regulations do n't apply in the wake of the financial meltdown , merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday , feb .
21 . " we want to make sure that in the future there are no gaps in the world regarding financial products , market participants or instruments , " she said . the german finance ministry also presented saturday a summary paper , reflecting the main changes to the global financial system that germany would like to see the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- major economic powers make at its summit on april 2 in london . germany is set to welcome sunday leaders britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers for a planning meeting ahead of the london summit . british prime minister gordon brown wrote to european leaders this week setting out areas where he thought they could take action before the g20 summit . " the eu should be using its influence to build an international consensus behind the necessary action that the international community has got to take , " brown 's spokesman told reuters news agency .
" we need to continue to provide fiscal stimulus to our national economies and ensure those are coordinated . " european agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin talks aim to forge a european position before g20 leaders meet the chancellor , criticized last year for being slow to match british and french national rescue plans , said new unified rules must apply to all financial market products , financial instruments and market participants . french president nicolas sarkozy , accused by some in the european union giving unfair aid to domestic carmakers , said europe should unite behind bold measures to fight the ongoing financial crisis . " i will not associate myself to a position that does not give an ambitious response to this deep crisis , " he told reporters on saturday . a summary document issued by german finance minister peer steinbrueck reflects the level of agreement to date between european finance ministers .
highlighting germany 's priorities for the g20 summit , steinbrueck 's notes back up merkel 's message that no financial market , product or stakeholder should remain unregulated . the document stresses transparency and accountability measures aimed at reining in some of the worst excesses of the financial system before the current bust . bonus limits for managers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managers should be pocketing bonuses for taking on too much risk , politicians said steinbrueck 's paper calls for , among other measures , an obligation for the originator of any security to retain at least 5 percent of risk - in response to the complex and unaccountable reselling of mortgages and other debt which caused the financial system to implode in 2008 . the document also calls for registration of hedge funds to be " imposed " and for the external regulation of hedge funds . steinbrueck has called for curbs on executive pay , to avoid " excessive risk taking and focus on the short term . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso has also called for placing limits on bankers ' bonuses . " the payment of excessive bonuses incites financial managers to take ill-considered risks , " barroso told the german daily hamburger abendblatt in remarks published saturday . atlas of risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an atlas of risk would likely make for some dark reading merkel said germany was " very well prepared " for sunday 's meeting .
a group of experts chaired by a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , otmar issing , had made several suggestions , she added . these include a map listing the risks faced by financial institutions operating worldwide , reflected in steinbrueck 's preparatory document , in which he calls for the establishment of " effective early warning mechanisms . " merkel said the g20 was working with " high pressure " on the implementation of a plan of action agreed at the group 's last meeting in november . at the london meeting , merkel expected the group to take " a significant step forward in implementing these measures . " " on sunday we will take preparatory measures to appear united and ambitious in london , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 .
the board represents several government ministries as well as the federal states where opel owns factories . opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated . bild also reported that additional losses expected up to 2011 would create new capital requirements of 1.1 billion euro . an economics ministry spokesperson refused to confirm the report , saying the government panel discussions were confidential .
the spokesperson added that there was presently no draft document which made it possible to evaluate what assistance might be necessary or available . according to bild , only a rescue guarantee package could help opel in the short term .
eu legislation specifies that , in return , the company would need to commit to huge cuts in staff and production capacity . opel confirmed friday that it will need greater state guarantees than requested to date but would not specify the amount . state bail out possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could opel be the next recipient of german bailout billions ?
the german government has said opel required a total of 3.3 billion euros in state guarantees , according to weekly spiegel magazine .
previously , the car manufacturer had requested 1.8 billion euros of state securities . news of the higher funding needs could weaken political supporters who have argued for extending guarantees . " it 's entirely clear that -lrb- opel -rrb- can not become a bottomless hole , " an unnamed source told reuters news agency .
" when you talk about a plan , then there must be one sum that can sustain a business model until time ' x ' without any ifs , ands or buts . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is also the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in september 's national elections , said a state bailout could it could be an option , particularly if the german carmaker breaks off from its troubled american parent company . " we currently can not be sure whether this will be the case , " steinmeier said .
" but with the information that we ’ re getting from gm in the us , it seems as if there is a chance for a greater independence of the european subsidiaries . " saab 's suffering sweden 's saab , one of gm 's other european brands , made a de facto split from the us automaker by filing for bankruptcy protection .
in a plan submitted to the us treasury , gm said the swedish firm would become an independent business as of the beginning of 2010 . the swedish government , however , said it was not prepared to guarantee loans gm said would be necessary to turn saab around . saab said friday that a court-appointed administrator would use the following three months to reorganize the company and search for additional sources of funding . dw staf -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's just the latest in a string of productions that deal with the nation 's recent past . uli edel 's " the baader-meinhof complex " is one of five films nominated for best foreign language film at the academy awards in los angeles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as perpetrators are featured in the latest crop of movies based on a book by stefan aust that was first published in 1985 , but only recently translated into english , the german film is facing off movies from france , israel , japan and austria in the battle for the coveted prize .
but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .
" you are a fascist asshole , " the andreas baader character screams at one of the judges in edel 's film .

this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .

austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .
" the baader-meinhof complex " deals with events that rocked west germany a generation later .
nevertheless , it has been about 30 years since the peak of the guerrilla movement 's activities , which presented a major challenge to the nation 's fledgling post-war democracy .
unfolding story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this chapter in german history is more than just a fading memory the story of the raf 's campaign , however , continues to unfold .

one of the movement 's leaders , christian klar , was released from jail in december - just months after another raf fighter , brigitte mohnhaupt , was set free .
this leaves only one raf member still behind bars : birgit hogefeld , 52 , also a one-time leader of the group , which was disbanded in 1998 .

it 's just the latest in a string of productions that deal with the nation 's recent past . uli edel 's " the baader-meinhof complex " is one of five films nominated for best foreign language film at the academy awards in los angeles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as perpetrators are featured in the latest crop of movies based on a book by stefan aust that was first published in 1985 , but only recently translated into english , the german film is facing off movies from france , israel , japan and austria in the battle for the coveted prize .
but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .
" you are a fascist asshole , " the andreas baader character screams at one of the judges in edel 's film .
second time around for leading lady bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's martina gedeck 's second oscar outing starring leading german actors martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu as the two founders of the group , ulrike meinhof and andreas baader , the movie premiered last autumn .
this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .
berlinale successes for german cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maren ade showed off her silver bear as a further sign of the current strength of german cinema , the berlin international film festival last week awarded german director maren ade a special jury prize for her movie " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- .
austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .
" the baader-meinhof complex " deals with events that rocked west germany a generation later .
nevertheless , it has been about 30 years since the peak of the guerrilla movement 's activities , which presented a major challenge to the nation 's fledgling post-war democracy .
unfolding story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this chapter in german history is more than just a fading memory the story of the raf 's campaign , however , continues to unfold .
only in the last two years has it emerged that the raf in the 1970s planned to abduct west german chancellor willy brandt and fashion designer karl lagerfeld .
and former faction members also continue to hit the headlines in germany .
one of the movement 's leaders , christian klar , was released from jail in december - just months after another raf fighter , brigitte mohnhaupt , was set free .
this leaves only one raf member still behind bars : birgit hogefeld , 52 , also a one-time leader of the group , which was disbanded in 1998 .
the recent releases are controversial partly because it still remains unclear who was actually responsible for some of the group 's more high-profile murders , including the gunning down of german employers ' federation president hanns martin schleyer . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .
this meeting now looks set to turn into an opportunity to lambast sarkozy over his recent proposals .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .

he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "

it 's just the latest in a string of productions that deal with the nation 's recent past . uli edel 's " the baader-meinhof complex " is one of five films nominated for best foreign language film at the academy awards in los angeles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as perpetrators are featured in the latest crop of movies based on a book by stefan aust that was first published in 1985 , but only recently translated into english , the german film is facing off movies from france , israel , japan and austria in the battle for the coveted prize .
but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .
" you are a fascist asshole , " the andreas baader character screams at one of the judges in edel 's film .
second time around for leading lady bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's martina gedeck 's second oscar outing starring leading german actors martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu as the two founders of the group , ulrike meinhof and andreas baader , the movie premiered last autumn .
this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .
berlinale successes for german cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maren ade showed off her silver bear as a further sign of the current strength of german cinema , the berlin international film festival last week awarded german director maren ade a special jury prize for her movie " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- .
austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .
" the baader-meinhof complex " deals with events that rocked west germany a generation later .
nevertheless , it has been about 30 years since the peak of the guerrilla movement 's activities , which presented a major challenge to the nation 's fledgling post-war democracy .
unfolding story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this chapter in german history is more than just a fading memory the story of the raf 's campaign , however , continues to unfold .
only in the last two years has it emerged that the raf in the 1970s planned to abduct west german chancellor willy brandt and fashion designer karl lagerfeld .
and former faction members also continue to hit the headlines in germany .
one of the movement 's leaders , christian klar , was released from jail in december - just months after another raf fighter , brigitte mohnhaupt , was set free .
this leaves only one raf member still behind bars : birgit hogefeld , 52 , also a one-time leader of the group , which was disbanded in 1998 .
the recent releases are controversial partly because it still remains unclear who was actually responsible for some of the group 's more high-profile murders , including the gunning down of german employers ' federation president hanns martin schleyer . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .

gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .

based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .

the board represents several government ministries as well as the federal states where opel owns factories . opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated . bild also reported that additional losses expected up to 2011 would create new capital requirements of 1.1 billion euro . an economics ministry spokesperson refused to confirm the report , saying the government panel discussions were confidential .
the spokesperson added that there was presently no draft document which made it possible to evaluate what assistance might be necessary or available . according to bild , only a rescue guarantee package could help opel in the short term .
eu legislation specifies that , in return , the company would need to commit to huge cuts in staff and production capacity . opel confirmed friday that it will need greater state guarantees than requested to date but would not specify the amount . state bail out possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could opel be the next recipient of german bailout billions ?
the german government has said opel required a total of 3.3 billion euros in state guarantees , according to weekly spiegel magazine .

" it 's entirely clear that -lrb- opel -rrb- can not become a bottomless hole , " an unnamed source told reuters news agency .
" when you talk about a plan , then there must be one sum that can sustain a business model until time ' x ' without any ifs , ands or buts . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is also the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in september 's national elections , said a state bailout could it could be an option , particularly if the german carmaker breaks off from its troubled american parent company . " we currently can not be sure whether this will be the case , " steinmeier said .
" but with the information that we ’ re getting from gm in the us , it seems as if there is a chance for a greater independence of the european subsidiaries . " saab 's suffering sweden 's saab , one of gm 's other european brands , made a de facto split from the us automaker by filing for bankruptcy protection .
in a plan submitted to the us treasury , gm said the swedish firm would become an independent business as of the beginning of 2010 . the swedish government , however , said it was not prepared to guarantee loans gm said would be necessary to turn saab around . saab said friday that a court-appointed administrator would use the following three months to reorganize the company and search for additional sources of funding . dw staf -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are , of course , very disappointed , because we could have taken at least a point , " said hertha coach lucien favre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.02.2009 merkel seeks lead role with european pre-g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks could put merkel and her government center stage german chancellor angela merkel is seizing the initiative in facing up to the global financial crisis by hosting talks on sunday with her european counterparts from the g20 group of the world 's wealthiest nations . with the prospect of german elections in september , clouded by the country 's biggest economic downturn in 60 years , merkel has stepped out of her previous inertia and summoned the heads of europe 's biggest economies to find common ground .
sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .
20 , but did n't make it far .
after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .
once again , he made it through the camp gates , but not without being spotted by british military police .
well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "
the local police have opened an investigation .
there was no word on how many push-ups the soldier will have to do as punishment when his hangover wears off . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hamburg could take the lead on sunday . demba ba scored a hat-trick for hoffenheim who missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw at vfb stuttgart - the point enough to put ralf rangnick 's side back on top on goal difference . the results could benefit third-placed sv hamburg who will go top if they can win at fifth-placed bayer leverkusen on sunday . midtable cologne boosted the weekend 's carnival celebrations in the city by handing juergen klinsmann 's bayern side a third defeat in four games since the winter break . it leaves bayern fourth on 38 points , two adrift of hoffenheim and hertha berlin ahead of a visit to werder bremen next weekend . bayern 's blues drag on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : underdogs cologne had plenty to celebrate against bayern bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge had a similarly disappointed view of his team 's match against cologne . " we had a bad day and we were caught ice cold on the break , " he said .
" we had bad luck with a disallowed goal but you have to say we did n't play well and did n't look good defensively . " bayern were looking to bounce back from last saturday 's 2-1 defeat at hertha , and had cologne-bound lukas podolski back in the side in the absence of injured italy striker luca toni . podolski , however , only lasted the first half before being replaced by us striker landon donovan . miroslav klose thought he had headed bayern in front only to be ruled out - wrongly as television pictures showed - for offside . cologne then caught the home side out in the 22nd minute when nemanja vucicevic threaded a ball through to fabrice ehret for the french midfielder to finish neatly with the outside of his left foot . a further shock came 12 minutes later when daniel brosinski netted in front of goal , with vucicevic again the provider after getting past philipp lahm on the right before sending in a low cross . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , will be in a cologne jersey next season belgian defender daniel van buyten headed bayern back in contention six minutes from time but cologne held on for the three points .

the draw continued stuttgart 's unbeaten streak , which runs back to november . " the spectators certainly got their money 's worth today , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick .
" it was an intense game which would we could have won , albeit unexpectedly .
we can live with 3-3 . " the tie came for hoffenheim just after the german soccer federation said it would look into doping violations by hoffenheim players andreas ibertsberger and christoph janker .

" we are , of course , very disappointed , because we could have taken at least a point , " said hertha coach lucien favre .
" in the second-half , we were actually the better team and we made wolfsburg look strong , so it 's hard to accept this defeat . " bottom club borussia moenchengladbach ended a run of eight games without a win by downing hanover 3-2 . first-half goals from alexander baumjohann and marko marin and a late winner from oliver neuville gave borussia the points after sergio pinto and christian schulz had hit back for the visitors . a last-minute goal from dimitar rangelov gave energie cottbus a 2-1 win over ailing werder bremen to lift the eastern german club out of the relegation zone . struggling arminia bielefeld and bochum finished 1-1 , while second-to-bottom karlsruhe slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to eintracht frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries . " the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said . nuclear program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western nations have said iran is developing nuclear weapons an international dispute over iran 's nuclear program is one of the issues tehran was hoping to discuss with the former chancellor . iran 's parliamentary speaker ali larijani addressed on saturday told schroeder that it is impossible to deprive tehran of nuclear technology for peaceful uses . " iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries . " the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said . nuclear program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western nations have said iran is developing nuclear weapons an international dispute over iran 's nuclear program is one of the issues tehran was hoping to discuss with the former chancellor . iran 's parliamentary speaker ali larijani addressed on saturday told schroeder that it is impossible to deprive tehran of nuclear technology for peaceful uses . " iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.02.2009 merkel seeks lead role with european pre-g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks could put merkel and her government center stage german chancellor angela merkel is seizing the initiative in facing up to the global financial crisis by hosting talks on sunday with her european counterparts from the g20 group of the world 's wealthiest nations . with the prospect of german elections in september , clouded by the country 's biggest economic downturn in 60 years , merkel has stepped out of her previous inertia and summoned the heads of europe 's biggest economies to find common ground .
sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .
this meeting now looks set to turn into an opportunity to lambast sarkozy over his recent proposals .
as the french president 's international approval ratings drop , this may give merkel an opportunity to regain a key european role . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .
20 , but did n't make it far .
after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .
once again , he made it through the camp gates , but not without being spotted by british military police .
well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "
the local police have opened an investigation .

it 's just the latest in a string of productions that deal with the nation 's recent past . uli edel 's " the baader-meinhof complex " is one of five films nominated for best foreign language film at the academy awards in los angeles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women as perpetrators are featured in the latest crop of movies based on a book by stefan aust that was first published in 1985 , but only recently translated into english , the german film is facing off movies from france , israel , japan and austria in the battle for the coveted prize .
but edel 's film is more than a historical account of the raf as he charts the war of terror that baader and meinhof waged in their bid to undermine the state by targeting prominent germans as well as us military bases .
" the guy in the uniform is a pig , " says one raf member in edel 's movie explaining the group 's tactics .
" he is not human and therefore can be shot . "
" the baader-meinhof complex " also goes on to portray the uproar in court when baader and the other gang members appeared .
" you are a fascist asshole , " the andreas baader character screams at one of the judges in edel 's film .
second time around for leading lady bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's martina gedeck 's second oscar outing starring leading german actors martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu as the two founders of the group , ulrike meinhof and andreas baader , the movie premiered last autumn .
this is the second time that a german film starring gedeck has been selected in the oscar race .
gedeck played a theater actress under pressure from the east german secret police to serve as an informant in florian henckel von donnersmarck 's " the lives of others , " which won the oscar two years ago .
in an interview with the germany press agency dpa , the 44-year-old gedeck said she believed that the recent international success of german movies was a sign of the strong stories behind the films .
" it has to do with the extraordinary stories the films have to tell , " said gedeck .
" they are true stories that have not been told , so they are interesting and different and often leave americans with their mouths open in cinemas , " she said .
berlinale successes for german cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maren ade showed off her silver bear as a further sign of the current strength of german cinema , the berlin international film festival last week awarded german director maren ade a special jury prize for her movie " alle anderen " -lrb- everyone else -rrb- .
austrian-born birgit minichmayr won the berlinale 's best actress award for her role in " alle anderen " .
marking the revival in interest in the darker side of german 's history , britain 's kate winslet has also been nominated for an oscar as best actress for her role in " the reader " , in which she plays an illiterate older woman who , as it turns out , is a former nazi concentration camp guard .
based on a 1995 novel by german law professor-turned author bernhard schlink and directed by britain 's stephan daldry , " the reader " has been nominated for five oscars , including best picture .
this follows recent movies that have helped to shed new light on world war ii and the sense of the political and human turmoil that followed the implosion of hitler 's imagined 1,000-year reich .
" the baader-meinhof complex " deals with events that rocked west germany a generation later .
nevertheless , it has been about 30 years since the peak of the guerrilla movement 's activities , which presented a major challenge to the nation 's fledgling post-war democracy .
unfolding story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this chapter in german history is more than just a fading memory the story of the raf 's campaign , however , continues to unfold .
only in the last two years has it emerged that the raf in the 1970s planned to abduct west german chancellor willy brandt and fashion designer karl lagerfeld .
and former faction members also continue to hit the headlines in germany .
one of the movement 's leaders , christian klar , was released from jail in december - just months after another raf fighter , brigitte mohnhaupt , was set free .
this leaves only one raf member still behind bars : birgit hogefeld , 52 , also a one-time leader of the group , which was disbanded in 1998 .

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .
this meeting now looks set to turn into an opportunity to lambast sarkozy over his recent proposals .
as the french president 's international approval ratings drop , this may give merkel an opportunity to regain a key european role . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .

she hopes to forge a common european stance before a g20 summit in april . there could no longer be blank spots where regulations do n't apply in the wake of the financial meltdown , merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday , feb .
21 . " we want to make sure that in the future there are no gaps in the world regarding financial products , market participants or instruments , " she said . the german finance ministry also presented saturday a summary paper , reflecting the main changes to the global financial system that germany would like to see the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- major economic powers make at its summit on april 2 in london . germany is set to welcome sunday leaders britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers for a planning meeting ahead of the london summit . british prime minister gordon brown wrote to european leaders this week setting out areas where he thought they could take action before the g20 summit . " the eu should be using its influence to build an international consensus behind the necessary action that the international community has got to take , " brown 's spokesman told reuters news agency .
" we need to continue to provide fiscal stimulus to our national economies and ensure those are coordinated . " european agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin talks aim to forge a european position before g20 leaders meet the chancellor , criticized last year for being slow to match british and french national rescue plans , said new unified rules must apply to all financial market products , financial instruments and market participants . french president nicolas sarkozy , accused by some in the european union giving unfair aid to domestic carmakers , said europe should unite behind bold measures to fight the ongoing financial crisis . " i will not associate myself to a position that does not give an ambitious response to this deep crisis , " he told reporters on saturday . a summary document issued by german finance minister peer steinbrueck reflects the level of agreement to date between european finance ministers .
highlighting germany 's priorities for the g20 summit , steinbrueck 's notes back up merkel 's message that no financial market , product or stakeholder should remain unregulated . the document stresses transparency and accountability measures aimed at reining in some of the worst excesses of the financial system before the current bust . bonus limits for managers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managers should be pocketing bonuses for taking on too much risk , politicians said steinbrueck 's paper calls for , among other measures , an obligation for the originator of any security to retain at least 5 percent of risk - in response to the complex and unaccountable reselling of mortgages and other debt which caused the financial system to implode in 2008 . the document also calls for registration of hedge funds to be " imposed " and for the external regulation of hedge funds . steinbrueck has called for curbs on executive pay , to avoid " excessive risk taking and focus on the short term . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso has also called for placing limits on bankers ' bonuses . " the payment of excessive bonuses incites financial managers to take ill-considered risks , " barroso told the german daily hamburger abendblatt in remarks published saturday . atlas of risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an atlas of risk would likely make for some dark reading merkel said germany was " very well prepared " for sunday 's meeting .
a group of experts chaired by a former chief economist of germany 's central bank , otmar issing , had made several suggestions , she added . these include a map listing the risks faced by financial institutions operating worldwide , reflected in steinbrueck 's preparatory document , in which he calls for the establishment of " effective early warning mechanisms . " merkel said the g20 was working with " high pressure " on the implementation of a plan of action agreed at the group 's last meeting in november . at the london meeting , merkel expected the group to take " a significant step forward in implementing these measures . " " on sunday we will take preparatory measures to appear united and ambitious in london , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's talks are due to be attended by france , great britain , italy , spain and the netherlands , who , together with germany , form the european contingent of the g20 group of the world 's 20 most developed countries .
the group 's aim is to develop a common european approach to the crisis , ahead of a g20 summit scheduled in london on april 2 .
merkel was criticized last year for not doing enough to pull germany out of recession .
mindful of how the german electorate will judge her crisis management skills come september , the chancellor is recasting herself as an international player to be reckoned with .
an active politician bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's partnership with steinbrueck makes carving out her own policies impossible , says neugebauer gero neugebauer , a political scientist at the free university in berlin , says merkel wants to be seen as " an active politician . "
he says the g20 summit can help her " give the impression that she is actively managing the crisis and playing her part in finding a solution . "
merkel , who leads the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is yoked to a joint economic policy with the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- within her coalition government .
the chancellor 's partnership with finance minister peer steinbrueck of the spd gives no opportunity for her to carve out distinct economic policies ahead of the election , neugebauer says .
instead , he says , she can use incentives such as sunday 's summit to stay in the headlines , and " demonstrate continued international activity . "
in the early days of the financial crisis , merkel 's reluctance to take any rash action earned her the nickname of " madame no . "
a step slow with stimulus plan ?
with an eye on the 2009 election year , the government had remained steadfast in its opposition to lowering taxes , and stuck to its prime goals of reducing borrowing and balancing the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel take too long to inject billions into the economy ?
as it became clearer that the financial storm would not blow over , merkel belatedly fell into line by proposing a fiscal stimulus package for europe 's largest economy .
a 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 40-billion -rrb- financial package was put forward in november , followed by a further 50-billion-euro package which has now been approved by germany 's upper house of parliament .
the package includes modest cuts to income tax , increased family benefits and investments in roads , schools , hospitals , railways and other infrastructure projects .
in addition , germany is providing a financial lifeline for failing banks .
merkel is intent on setting up a new regulatory framework that prevents a recurrence of the current crisis , and has proposed a " risk map " which would identify products and companies with high financial exposure .
the chancellor has said that , whilst tackling the current economic difficulties , questions about the cause of the current financial crisis must not " fall by the wayside . "
for merkel and her conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the key to stable financial markets draws on the concept of social market economy , a central strand of cdu ideology .
merkel : government must monitor economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy could face some tough questioning about his proposals unlike the anglo-saxon model , which is being blamed in part for the current crisis , merkel 's cdu envisages an active government stewardship of the economy , keeping financial institutions in check and obliging business to provide pensions and contribute to health care .
hence merkel 's calls for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures , all of which are reflected in the 47 guidelines drawn up at the last g20 summit in washington last november .
merkel has high expectations of april 's summit , which she has called an " essential " meeting .
buoyed by assurances from us president barack obama , the chancellor is expecting the summit to go a long way in setting up concrete measures .
finding consensus one of the challenges at sunday 's talks in berlin will be to find consensus on the use of protectionist measures .
while merkel has opposed incentives that favor the domestic economy , the french government has offered 6 billion euros in soft loans to renault and peugeot-citroen , on the condition that the companies keep production and jobs in france .
these plans have met with anger in slovakia and the czech republic , where the french carmakers have production sites .
in an open letter to the rotating czech eu presidency , merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy last week called for an additional eu summit to discuss the financial crisis .

not surprisingly , his blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit . the highly inebriated 18-year-old soldier left the base with the first tank early on friday morning , feb .
20 , but did n't make it far .
after just half a kilometer -lrb- third of a mile -rrb- he veered off the road and the eight-ton scimitar tank came to a halt .
determined to finish what he 'd started , the wobbly recruit walked back to base and took off in another one of the massive reconnaissance vehicles .
once again , he made it through the camp gates , but not without being spotted by british military police .
well-practiced after the first episode , the soldier managed to travel all of three kilometers the second time around , just narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car .
pursued by his colleagues , the young tank thief finally swerved and hit a beech tree .
" he evidently tried to shake them off , then lost control of the vehicle , " a police spokesman said .
" i do n't know if he was an experienced tank driver , but i 'm not sure you can be at 18 . "
the local police have opened an investigation .
there was no word on how many push-ups the soldier will have to do as punishment when his hangover wears off . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bank 's lawyers said complying with the us would be very costly . ubs ' lawyers said friday , feb .
20 , that acting in according with a us order to reveal the names of 52,000 suspected tax dodgers could have severe consequences .
ubs employees could face " substantial prison terms as well as fines , penalties and other sanctions , " they said . in addition , compliance with the demands made in the suit filed on wednesday on behalf of the us international revenue service would force ubs " to violate swiss law in a manner that will expose it to penalties , civil liability and the possible revocation of its banking license , " continued the lawyers . friday 's temporary court ruling halts the future transfer of data until a petition brought by eight bank clients was heard and ubs and others were able to make their statements to the judges . the clients claim there is no legal basis for transferring their data and that such a move would cause them harm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has particularly strict laws on sharing bank data with third parties some experts say the case , a new step in the growing global fight against tax evasion , opens cracks in the country 's longstanding bank secrecy laws . the tradition of swiss banking secrecy dates back to legislation from 1934 .
it placed unusually tight restrictions on the amount of information banks are allowed to share with third parties , including foreign governments seeking out tax cheats . ubs to challenge lawsuit on thursday , ubs had agreed to pay $ 780 million and identify some of its suspected customers in response to us charges that it had helped american citizens evade taxes . the bank said some of its employees engaged in " improper conduct " and officials admitted that the institution had made mistakes , but has also said it would challenge the us lawsuit . ubs , with the support of the swiss regulatory body finma , has handed over the names of those clients suspected of deliberate criminal acts , but said thousands of other clients would still be protected under swiss laws . reports estimated that 250 names had been handed over , but the number has not been confirmed . the swiss court said friday that finma 's authorization to hand over the initial data had prejudiced the outcome of an ongoing legal evaluation in switzerland on whether the account holders had committed tax fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has promised to go after tax havens shares reflect concerns ubs shares fell sharply friday morning , dropping 17 percent at one point in early trading and ultimately closing at 11 swiss francs , down 14 percent from its opening price . the drop in stocks comes a week after both ubs and credit suisse , the second-largest swiss bank , reported huge fourth- quarter losses . ubs 's 2008 losses amounted to more than 19.6 billion francs .
it has announced job cuts and taken a $ 58-billion bailout from the swiss government . ubs was not the only financial institution to do fairy poorly on the stock market friday .
credit suisse dropped 9 percent and other banks also fell .
analysts said this was due to concern for the whole sector . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hamburg could take the lead on sunday . demba ba scored a hat-trick for hoffenheim who missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw at vfb stuttgart - the point enough to put ralf rangnick 's side back on top on goal difference . the results could benefit third-placed sv hamburg who will go top if they can win at fifth-placed bayer leverkusen on sunday . midtable cologne boosted the weekend 's carnival celebrations in the city by handing juergen klinsmann 's bayern side a third defeat in four games since the winter break . it leaves bayern fourth on 38 points , two adrift of hoffenheim and hertha berlin ahead of a visit to werder bremen next weekend . bayern 's blues drag on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : underdogs cologne had plenty to celebrate against bayern bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge had a similarly disappointed view of his team 's match against cologne . " we had a bad day and we were caught ice cold on the break , " he said .
" we had bad luck with a disallowed goal but you have to say we did n't play well and did n't look good defensively . " bayern were looking to bounce back from last saturday 's 2-1 defeat at hertha , and had cologne-bound lukas podolski back in the side in the absence of injured italy striker luca toni . podolski , however , only lasted the first half before being replaced by us striker landon donovan . miroslav klose thought he had headed bayern in front only to be ruled out - wrongly as television pictures showed - for offside . cologne then caught the home side out in the 22nd minute when nemanja vucicevic threaded a ball through to fabrice ehret for the french midfielder to finish neatly with the outside of his left foot . a further shock came 12 minutes later when daniel brosinski netted in front of goal , with vucicevic again the provider after getting past philipp lahm on the right before sending in a low cross . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , will be in a cologne jersey next season belgian defender daniel van buyten headed bayern back in contention six minutes from time but cologne held on for the three points . " we played with a lot of heart and had that little bit of luck you need in certain situations , " cologne coach christoph daum said . three players , six goals in stuttgart demba ba scored all three goals for hoffenheim , while mario gomez hit two for stuttgart as the two sides shared six goals .
but the visitors missed a golden opportunity for victory when sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from the penalty spot in stoppage time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demba ba put his name next to all three of hoffenheim 's goals senegalese striker ba opened the scoring in the 24th minute and hit a second just before half-time after cacau and mario gomez had struck for the home side . gomez then put stuttgart in front with a clever goal lob in the 63rd minute only for ba to strike again four minutes later .
the draw continued stuttgart 's unbeaten streak , which runs back to november . " the spectators certainly got their money 's worth today , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick .
" it was an intense game which would we could have won , albeit unexpectedly .
we can live with 3-3 . " the tie came for hoffenheim just after the german soccer federation said it would look into doping violations by hoffenheim players andreas ibertsberger and christoph janker .
the players tested negative after a feb .

" we are , of course , very disappointed , because we could have taken at least a point , " said hertha coach lucien favre .
" in the second-half , we were actually the better team and we made wolfsburg look strong , so it 's hard to accept this defeat . " bottom club borussia moenchengladbach ended a run of eight games without a win by downing hanover 3-2 . first-half goals from alexander baumjohann and marko marin and a late winner from oliver neuville gave borussia the points after sergio pinto and christian schulz had hit back for the visitors . a last-minute goal from dimitar rangelov gave energie cottbus a 2-1 win over ailing werder bremen to lift the eastern german club out of the relegation zone . struggling arminia bielefeld and bochum finished 1-1 , while second-to-bottom karlsruhe slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to eintracht frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . " just hours before he was due meet ahmadinejad , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against the existence of israel and his denial of the holocaust . " the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said on saturday , at a speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran . taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shroeder urged iran to act responsibly on the international scene schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power . the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the middle east conflict . iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor . " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it , " said the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian . it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added . iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries . " the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said . nuclear program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western nations have said iran is developing nuclear weapons an international dispute over iran 's nuclear program is one of the issues tehran was hoping to discuss with the former chancellor . iran 's parliamentary speaker ali larijani addressed on saturday told schroeder that it is impossible to deprive tehran of nuclear technology for peaceful uses . " iran has observed international regulations and depriving iran of nuclear technology and energy for peaceful purposes is impossible , " larijani said . the latest remarks by larijani , a former nuclear negotiator for iran , came after the international atomic energy agency on thursday said iran is continuing to enrich uranium , potentially a stage in making an atomic bomb , but has slowed down the expansion of its enrichment activities . the united states and the european union accuse iran of developing nuclear weapons .
tehran insists that its nuclear program serves the exclusive civilian purpose of generating electricity . schroeder : new chance to ease tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us president could open lines of communication with iran schroeder recommend iran take advantage by the opportunity of a new us administration taking office to ease tension with the west . " with the new us administration there is a chance of having a multilateral approach , not only with the islamic world but with everybody ...
that is a good opportunity for iran , " the mehr news agency quoted him as saying . during campaigning , us president barack obama said he would engage in talks with iran .

but officials were no longer sure of his whereabouts . christian bouchacourt , south american superior for the society of st. pius x in buenos aires , told the newspaper la nacion on saturday , feb .
21 , that british-born richard williamson would comply with the government order within the given deadline . the ultra-traditionalist bishop had been told he had 10 days to leave the country .
if williamson refused to leave voluntarily , he would be forcibly deported , officials said .
he could , however , still appeal the decision . under pressure from the jewish community and other groups in argentina , the government on friday was tried to formally deliver expulsion documents to the holocaust-denying catholic bishop richard williamson , but were uncertain of his whereabouts . the argentine interior ministry and the state organ in charge of immigration procedures said on friday that they did not know where the bishop was .
but they said they would officially notify him at the address he has declared as his permanent address , which would start the 10-day clock running for him to leave . williamson was among four members of the society of st. pius x bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month .
the move provoked worldwide furor in the catholic and jewish communities as well as in the german chancellery . the german-born benedict made the generous overture just days after williamson in an interview with swedish television denied jews died in nazi gas chambers .
he later said he would need time to consider the evidence of the holocaust personally before retracting his statement . real motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's denials of the holocaust embarrassed the vatican argentina 's official expulsion resolution charges that williamson lied about his real motives for seeking residence in argentina .
he had told immigration officials that he was an administrative employee of the lay organization " la tradicion , " but in reality he was working as a priest and director of a seminary run by the the st. pius x society in la reja , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires . the address he gave for the lay association is the same as that for the st. pius x society in buenos aires . a member of the seminary that williamson formally directed until feb .
8 said the bishop had left on thursday .
other sources at the congregation declined to give details of his location . interior minister florencio randazzo said on thursday that argentina was acting because williamson has denied the jewish genocide during hitler 's third reich .
those actions have insulted " argentineans , the jewish people and all of humanity , " randazzo said . argentine media reported that the government carried out a thorough investigation to find a legal irregularity that would warrant his expulsion , which was being demanded by the country 's jewish community and other sectors . jewish groups hail expulsion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson will have to leave the seminary that he directed until recently angel schindel , vice president of the delegation of argentina 's israelite associations -lrb- daia -rrb- said that the organization very much agreed with the government 's decision . " we were among those who called for the expulsion , " he said . schindel said he believed argentina needed to pass a new law , similar to one in germany , that would make denial of the holocaust a crime , along with denials of the armenian genocide or the crimes of the most recent dictatorship in argentina , which occurred from 1976 to 1983 . some german catholic bishops and leaders have already declared williamson persona non grata in their districts . the world jewish council -lrb- wjc -rrb- said the decision to expel williamson " is commendable . "
in a statement issued in new york , wjc president ronald s lauder praised the argentine government for what he called a brave decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 6 million jews perished in the holocaust he added that he hoped other countries would do likewise when faced with anti-semitism and the denial of the holocaust . good relations with the vatican juan pablo cafiero , argentine ambassador to the vatican , denied that williamson 's expulsion would harm relations with the vatican . " this will in no way have an influence on the relationship between argentina and the holy see , which fully understands that this has been a sovereign decision in applying argentine law to someone who was forging data , " cafiero said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the document , circulating on the internet , names kate winslet as best actress for her role in the reader .
the list , which features an authentic-looking letterhead , also claims british film slumdog millionaire will bag the best picture and best director prizes .
academy spokeswoman leslie unger said it was a forgery and the event 's auditors were still counting votes .
" the document is a complete fraud , " she said .
" there are only two people there who will know the complete list of winners in advance of the envelopes being opened during the ceremony . "

winslet , who went on to win ahead of hathaway , has been nominated for an oscar on five previous occasions , but has yet to take home an academy statuette .

advertisement panorama archive : 1976 robert mugabe interview president robert mugabe , zimbabwe 's controversial ruler , has reached his 85th birthday .
to mark the occasion , the bbc 's african perspective programme asked his former friends , employees and interviewers to recall their most memorable encounters with " uncle bob " , as he is known in zimbabwe .
wilf mbanga , editor , the zimbabwean i remember very well how i first met robert mugabe .
in 1974 , i did a series of profiles of nationalist leaders who had come out of jail .
we had not had pictures or heard of them for years .
i went round interviewing all of them .
one man stood out .
robert mugabe .
his supporters were engaged in a war with -lsb- prime minister -rsb- ian smith 's army .
and yet he was talking of forgiveness happy birthday , mugabe ?
he was the one without any hatred for the white man .
he hated the system but he bore no grudges .
he was like a breath of fresh air .
my kind of man .
he very quickly became my friend .
and he would come to my house .
most people found him very cold , but once he opened up , you saw another side of him - how relaxed he could be .
i remember we would have music on my gramophone .
sometimes we would sing along to pat boone and jim reeves and so on .
he does have a funny side .
i have n't seen that lately , though .
poisoned friendships i first noticed a change in him soon after the referendum on our constitution in 2000 , which was rejected by zimbabweans .
he was now angry .
he believed white zimbabweans had influenced black zimbabweans to reject his constitution .
mugabe : the survivor his language had changed .
he said , " the white man is our enemy . "
he was beside himself with anger .
that was a different mugabe to the one i had met back in 1974 .
remember , back then , he had just come out of jail .
his son had died while he was inside and he was n't allowed to bury him .
his supporters were engaged in a war with -lsb- prime minister -rsb- ian smith 's army .
and yet he was talking of forgiveness .
you might remember the speech in 1980 , at the end of the war , where he talked of reconciliation .
i remember listening with tears running down my cheeks , when he said , " let 's turn our swords into ploughshares .
let 's forget the past .
let 's look to the future .
" even if yesterday you were my enemy , " he said , " today you are my friend . "
in 2000 , they were no longer his friends .
it was now foreigners , whites , americans , british who were " poisoning our people " .
we were at war .
they wanted to " re-colonise our country " .
in africa , what he was saying found resonance .
how come 250,000 whites own the majority of land in a black country ?
this was wrong .
and with one swing , one argument , everybody believed him .
but we were not told the real story .
what he wanted was simply to stop the opposition .
watching opponent morgan tsvangirai become prime minister earlier this month andrew mutandwa , former press secretary to mugabe we did not read him right , in the beginning .
we were hungry for a hero .
a lot of us had never met a black person who was so eloquent .
a man who appeared so intelligent , and so powerful .
he is a very hard task master .
when you are working for him on a speech , he does n't want to see a comma out of place .
by the mid 1980s , i started sensing he was losing interest in what the world said even if that speech is just for him , he wants to make sure that all the punctuation , the grammar , the spelling , everything is perfect .
my days started quite early .
i was listening to international broadcasts - voice of america , radio moscow , bbc world service - to find things that were relevant to zimbabwe .
in the early years , mr mugabe showed quite a lot of interest .
he felt that he had been out of the loop and he wanted to catch up with what was happening in the world .
by the mid 1980s , i started sensing he was losing interest in what the world said or what was going on in the world .
he had already decided what his own kind of world was going to be like .
robert mugabe -lrb- l -rrb- at lancaster house , london , 1979 , with his rival joshua nkomo julian marshall , bbc focus on africa producer , 1975-90 robert mugabe first came into my consciousness in the mid-1970s when the war against the white supremacist government was starting to take off .
at that particular time , mugabe was very anxious to become the leader of zanu and challenge the current leader reverend ndabaningi sithole .
mugabe made a broadcast on -lsb- bbc -rsb- focus on africa in which he explicitly challenged his leadership .
it was successful because he knew there would be those listening in the camps in mozambique who would support him and move against sithole .
and this was exactly what happened .
robert mugabe born : 1924 trained as a teacher 1961 : married ghanaian sally hayfron 1964 : imprisoned by rhodesian government 1980 : wins post-independence elections 1996 : marries grace marufu 2000 : loses referendum 2000 : land invasions start 2002 : wins presidential elections , dismissed by western observers 2008 : disputed election results ; agrees power-sharing deal with mdc i got to know mr mugabe a lot better at the lancaster house talks in 1979 .
this was a conference called by britain inviting all the involved parties to try to resolve the conflict in zimbabwe .
mugabe headed his zanu-delegation .
he seemed like a very slight figure , always wearing a scarf to guard against the british cold .
a very ascetic , very intense individual ; very focused ; he was very much a contrast to his major political opponent joshua nkomo , who was a large man given to emotional outbursts .
mugabe was very much the counterpoint to that , an intellectual who knew exactly what he wanted .
at that time he was portrayed in the british media as a terrorist .
i think he was aware that that was the label .
but he knew exactly what he wanted and managed to get it all at lancaster house .
pent-up anger during the conference , mr mugabe moved out of the london hotel provided for him by the british government .
mr mugabe was convinced the british government was spying on him he was convinced it had been bugged , so that any discussions he might have been having with members of his delegation were being listened to by the british government .
i and anyone who met him were impressed by what seemed to be his very spartan lifestyle .
he was n't given to overt luxury , certainly not to visitors .
that had probably come about as a result of the time he spent in prison and his early education which was at the hands of catholic jesuits .
in a way there was a sense of pent-up anger i think .
he kept the lid on for the most part because he needed to at that time .
apparently he was a very different character when he was back in mozambique .
from the experience of former guerrillas who opposed his leadership it was clear that he was capable of extreme ruthlessness .
i do n't think robert mugabe has ever been a likable individual or cared much about being liked .
i think he wants to be respected and more latterly he wants to be feared .
' gay mafia ' at one point i put it to him : " do you ever get out ?
do you ever see the appalling state of your schools and hospitals ? "
he said to me , " julian , that is a very homosexual question . "
at that time , the -lsb- british -rsb- government of tony blair contained a couple of ministers who were homosexual .
mr mugabe referred to them as " the gay mafia " .
he thought homosexuals were out to get him .
and therefore anybody who criticised him became " homosexual " .
all of these things became conflated in his mind .
" if you are not for me , you are against me . "
he was n't the sort of person you could establish any sort of personal chemistry with .
you were always aware of there being a certain distance .
but that does n't mean to say he was n't capable of greeting you in a familiar way .
he used to make a point of attending cricket matches .
the white spectators were always very pleased to see him there .
he was referred to affectionately as " uncle bob " .
for me , it has always been an enigma as to at what point he changed .
tune into the bbc world service to listen to african perspective 's : meeting bob on saturday 21 february at 2106 gmt .
the programme will be available for a week on the website .

he seemed like a very slight figure , always wearing a scarf to guard against the british cold .
a very ascetic , very intense individual ; very focused ; he was very much a contrast to his major political opponent joshua nkomo , who was a large man given to emotional outbursts .
mugabe was very much the counterpoint to that , an intellectual who knew exactly what he wanted .
at that time he was portrayed in the british media as a terrorist .
i think he was aware that that was the label .
but he knew exactly what he wanted and managed to get it all at lancaster house .
pent-up anger during the conference , mr mugabe moved out of the london hotel provided for him by the british government .
mr mugabe was convinced the british government was spying on him he was convinced it had been bugged , so that any discussions he might have been having with members of his delegation were being listened to by the british government .
i and anyone who met him were impressed by what seemed to be his very spartan lifestyle .
he was n't given to overt luxury , certainly not to visitors .
that had probably come about as a result of the time he spent in prison and his early education which was at the hands of catholic jesuits .
in a way there was a sense of pent-up anger i think .
he kept the lid on for the most part because he needed to at that time .
apparently he was a very different character when he was back in mozambique .
from the experience of former guerrillas who opposed his leadership it was clear that he was capable of extreme ruthlessness .
i do n't think robert mugabe has ever been a likable individual or cared much about being liked .
i think he wants to be respected and more latterly he wants to be feared .
' gay mafia ' at one point i put it to him : " do you ever get out ?
do you ever see the appalling state of your schools and hospitals ? "
he said to me , " julian , that is a very homosexual question . "
at that time , the -lsb- british -rsb- government of tony blair contained a couple of ministers who were homosexual .
mr mugabe referred to them as " the gay mafia " .
he thought homosexuals were out to get him .
and therefore anybody who criticised him became " homosexual " .
all of these things became conflated in his mind .
" if you are not for me , you are against me . "
he was n't the sort of person you could establish any sort of personal chemistry with .
you were always aware of there being a certain distance .
but that does n't mean to say he was n't capable of greeting you in a familiar way .
he used to make a point of attending cricket matches .
the white spectators were always very pleased to see him there .
he was referred to affectionately as " uncle bob " .
for me , it has always been an enigma as to at what point he changed .
tune into the bbc world service to listen to african perspective 's : meeting bob on saturday 21 february at 2106 gmt .
the programme will be available for a week on the website .

advertisement panorama archive : 1976 robert mugabe interview president robert mugabe , zimbabwe 's controversial ruler , has reached his 85th birthday .
to mark the occasion , the bbc 's african perspective programme asked his former friends , employees and interviewers to recall their most memorable encounters with " uncle bob " , as he is known in zimbabwe .
wilf mbanga , editor , the zimbabwean i remember very well how i first met robert mugabe .
in 1974 , i did a series of profiles of nationalist leaders who had come out of jail .
we had not had pictures or heard of them for years .
i went round interviewing all of them .
one man stood out .
robert mugabe .
his supporters were engaged in a war with -lsb- prime minister -rsb- ian smith 's army .
and yet he was talking of forgiveness happy birthday , mugabe ?
he was the one without any hatred for the white man .
he hated the system but he bore no grudges .
he was like a breath of fresh air .
my kind of man .
he very quickly became my friend .
and he would come to my house .
most people found him very cold , but once he opened up , you saw another side of him - how relaxed he could be .
i remember we would have music on my gramophone .
sometimes we would sing along to pat boone and jim reeves and so on .
he does have a funny side .
i have n't seen that lately , though .
poisoned friendships i first noticed a change in him soon after the referendum on our constitution in 2000 , which was rejected by zimbabweans .
he was now angry .
he believed white zimbabweans had influenced black zimbabweans to reject his constitution .
mugabe : the survivor his language had changed .
he said , " the white man is our enemy . "
he was beside himself with anger .
that was a different mugabe to the one i had met back in 1974 .
remember , back then , he had just come out of jail .
his son had died while he was inside and he was n't allowed to bury him .
his supporters were engaged in a war with -lsb- prime minister -rsb- ian smith 's army .
and yet he was talking of forgiveness .
you might remember the speech in 1980 , at the end of the war , where he talked of reconciliation .
i remember listening with tears running down my cheeks , when he said , " let 's turn our swords into ploughshares .
let 's forget the past .
let 's look to the future .
" even if yesterday you were my enemy , " he said , " today you are my friend . "
in 2000 , they were no longer his friends .
it was now foreigners , whites , americans , british who were " poisoning our people " .
we were at war .
they wanted to " re-colonise our country " .
in africa , what he was saying found resonance .
how come 250,000 whites own the majority of land in a black country ?
this was wrong .
and with one swing , one argument , everybody believed him .
but we were not told the real story .
what he wanted was simply to stop the opposition .
watching opponent morgan tsvangirai become prime minister earlier this month andrew mutandwa , former press secretary to mugabe we did not read him right , in the beginning .
we were hungry for a hero .
a lot of us had never met a black person who was so eloquent .
a man who appeared so intelligent , and so powerful .
he is a very hard task master .
when you are working for him on a speech , he does n't want to see a comma out of place .
by the mid 1980s , i started sensing he was losing interest in what the world said even if that speech is just for him , he wants to make sure that all the punctuation , the grammar , the spelling , everything is perfect .
my days started quite early .
i was listening to international broadcasts - voice of america , radio moscow , bbc world service - to find things that were relevant to zimbabwe .
in the early years , mr mugabe showed quite a lot of interest .
he felt that he had been out of the loop and he wanted to catch up with what was happening in the world .
by the mid 1980s , i started sensing he was losing interest in what the world said or what was going on in the world .
he had already decided what his own kind of world was going to be like .
robert mugabe -lrb- l -rrb- at lancaster house , london , 1979 , with his rival joshua nkomo julian marshall , bbc focus on africa producer , 1975-90 robert mugabe first came into my consciousness in the mid-1970s when the war against the white supremacist government was starting to take off .
at that particular time , mugabe was very anxious to become the leader of zanu and challenge the current leader reverend ndabaningi sithole .
mugabe made a broadcast on -lsb- bbc -rsb- focus on africa in which he explicitly challenged his leadership .
it was successful because he knew there would be those listening in the camps in mozambique who would support him and move against sithole .
and this was exactly what happened .
robert mugabe born : 1924 trained as a teacher 1961 : married ghanaian sally hayfron 1964 : imprisoned by rhodesian government 1980 : wins post-independence elections 1996 : marries grace marufu 2000 : loses referendum 2000 : land invasions start 2002 : wins presidential elections , dismissed by western observers 2008 : disputed election results ; agrees power-sharing deal with mdc i got to know mr mugabe a lot better at the lancaster house talks in 1979 .

by the mid 1980s , i started sensing he was losing interest in what the world said even if that speech is just for him , he wants to make sure that all the punctuation , the grammar , the spelling , everything is perfect .
my days started quite early .
i was listening to international broadcasts - voice of america , radio moscow , bbc world service - to find things that were relevant to zimbabwe .
in the early years , mr mugabe showed quite a lot of interest .
he felt that he had been out of the loop and he wanted to catch up with what was happening in the world .
by the mid 1980s , i started sensing he was losing interest in what the world said or what was going on in the world .
he had already decided what his own kind of world was going to be like .
robert mugabe -lrb- l -rrb- at lancaster house , london , 1979 , with his rival joshua nkomo julian marshall , bbc focus on africa producer , 1975-90 robert mugabe first came into my consciousness in the mid-1970s when the war against the white supremacist government was starting to take off .
at that particular time , mugabe was very anxious to become the leader of zanu and challenge the current leader reverend ndabaningi sithole .
mugabe made a broadcast on -lsb- bbc -rsb- focus on africa in which he explicitly challenged his leadership .
it was successful because he knew there would be those listening in the camps in mozambique who would support him and move against sithole .
and this was exactly what happened .
robert mugabe born : 1924 trained as a teacher 1961 : married ghanaian sally hayfron 1964 : imprisoned by rhodesian government 1980 : wins post-independence elections 1996 : marries grace marufu 2000 : loses referendum 2000 : land invasions start 2002 : wins presidential elections , dismissed by western observers 2008 : disputed election results ; agrees power-sharing deal with mdc i got to know mr mugabe a lot better at the lancaster house talks in 1979 .
this was a conference called by britain inviting all the involved parties to try to resolve the conflict in zimbabwe .
mugabe headed his zanu-delegation .
he seemed like a very slight figure , always wearing a scarf to guard against the british cold .
a very ascetic , very intense individual ; very focused ; he was very much a contrast to his major political opponent joshua nkomo , who was a large man given to emotional outbursts .
mugabe was very much the counterpoint to that , an intellectual who knew exactly what he wanted .
at that time he was portrayed in the british media as a terrorist .
i think he was aware that that was the label .
but he knew exactly what he wanted and managed to get it all at lancaster house .
pent-up anger during the conference , mr mugabe moved out of the london hotel provided for him by the british government .
mr mugabe was convinced the british government was spying on him he was convinced it had been bugged , so that any discussions he might have been having with members of his delegation were being listened to by the british government .
i and anyone who met him were impressed by what seemed to be his very spartan lifestyle .
he was n't given to overt luxury , certainly not to visitors .
that had probably come about as a result of the time he spent in prison and his early education which was at the hands of catholic jesuits .
in a way there was a sense of pent-up anger i think .
he kept the lid on for the most part because he needed to at that time .
apparently he was a very different character when he was back in mozambique .
from the experience of former guerrillas who opposed his leadership it was clear that he was capable of extreme ruthlessness .
i do n't think robert mugabe has ever been a likable individual or cared much about being liked .
i think he wants to be respected and more latterly he wants to be feared .
' gay mafia ' at one point i put it to him : " do you ever get out ?
do you ever see the appalling state of your schools and hospitals ? "
he said to me , " julian , that is a very homosexual question . "
at that time , the -lsb- british -rsb- government of tony blair contained a couple of ministers who were homosexual .
mr mugabe referred to them as " the gay mafia " .
he thought homosexuals were out to get him .
and therefore anybody who criticised him became " homosexual " .
all of these things became conflated in his mind .
" if you are not for me , you are against me . "
he was n't the sort of person you could establish any sort of personal chemistry with .
you were always aware of there being a certain distance .
but that does n't mean to say he was n't capable of greeting you in a familiar way .
he used to make a point of attending cricket matches .
the white spectators were always very pleased to see him there .
he was referred to affectionately as " uncle bob " .
for me , it has always been an enigma as to at what point he changed .
tune into the bbc world service to listen to african perspective 's : meeting bob on saturday 21 february at 2106 gmt .
the programme will be available for a week on the website .
