mobile compost is in fact a british company that takes the phones apart and recycles them .

but " when they saw the sign for mobile compost , then they came with their phones the next time , " he said .
anders svensson , who was in the shop to buy a new phone , explained he was keeping his old cell phone because he needed the new one just for work .
when the old phone is no longer in use " then it will probably land in a drawer at home , " he said .

mobile compost is in fact a british company that takes the phones apart and recycles them .

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
whereas if he were granted political asylum in switzerland , he could continue working as a journalist , according to la tribune . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

the western germans are currently placed 11th . " i am glad that a decision about my future has been reached and the speculation about me is over , " podolski said on his home page . podolski said he had good talks with cologne coach christoph daum and general manager michael meier as cologne aim to build a strong team around the popular forward who is their biggest transfer . " the club 's concept convinced me - we want to achieve something over the next years in cologne , " podolski told the cologne website . hometown hero ignores other offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has been eager to return to cologne italy 's roma as well as bundesliga clubs werder bremen and sv hamburg also showed interest in podolski , but all that he wanted was a homecoming to cologne where he played from his youth onwards until 2006 . " i am very happy that lukas returns to us .
he followed his heart , " said cologne president wolfgang overath , himself a former club icon who won the 1974 world cup . munich general manager uli hoeness said that " we granted his request to return to cologne " and expressed his belief that podolski will show character in his final months at the champions .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .

more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .
" but a lot of germans do n't trust brussels , and a lot of other people do n't either , so we just have to live with what we 've got . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .
" no monitoring system is necessary as ukraine will receive gas for its own needs , " putin said at the ceremony ending the two countries ' gas dispute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said that eu observers were no longer needed both putin and timoshenko said the deal allowed for " subjective " issues to be sidelined from hindering their gas trade in the future .
gas disputes between russia and ukraine have been a chronic end-of- year problem since 2005 when pro-western leaders came to power in ukraine in the so-called orange revolution .
putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .
but ukraine will pay at discounted prices of 20 per cent on deliveries this year in return for keeping transit fees at 2008 prices , putin said .
europe still made to wait for gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could still be waiting for its gas in three-days time under the deal , the two-post soviet countries will deal directly instead of trading though swiss-based intermediary rosukrenergo , which is 50 per cent owned by gazprom .
russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .
the european union has been hard hit by the gas row since russia cut all supplies via ukraine on january 7 , accusing ukraine of stealing transits .
roughly one quarter of all gas burnt in the eu comes from russia , and 80 per cent of it passes through ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said that eu observers were no longer needed both putin and timoshenko said the deal allowed for " subjective " issues to be sidelined from hindering their gas trade in the future .
gas disputes between russia and ukraine have been a chronic end-of- year problem since 2005 when pro-western leaders came to power in ukraine in the so-called orange revolution .
putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .

russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .
" no monitoring system is necessary as ukraine will receive gas for its own needs , " putin said at the ceremony ending the two countries ' gas dispute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said that eu observers were no longer needed both putin and timoshenko said the deal allowed for " subjective " issues to be sidelined from hindering their gas trade in the future .
gas disputes between russia and ukraine have been a chronic end-of- year problem since 2005 when pro-western leaders came to power in ukraine in the so-called orange revolution .
putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .
but ukraine will pay at discounted prices of 20 per cent on deliveries this year in return for keeping transit fees at 2008 prices , putin said .
europe still made to wait for gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could still be waiting for its gas in three-days time under the deal , the two-post soviet countries will deal directly instead of trading though swiss-based intermediary rosukrenergo , which is 50 per cent owned by gazprom .
russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .
the european union has been hard hit by the gas row since russia cut all supplies via ukraine on january 7 , accusing ukraine of stealing transits .
roughly one quarter of all gas burnt in the eu comes from russia , and 80 per cent of it passes through ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , rwanda announced the decision to restore ties . rwanda is restoring diplomatic relations with germany , after a falling out between the two countries over berlin 's arrest of a top official for her role in the 1994 genocide in the small land-locked central african country . the two countries had agreed to work together to sort out matters of contention and planned to re-appoint ambassadors to their respective capitals , according to a foreign ministry statement issued on monday . " germany and rwanda share a long history of friendly relations .
in the mutual interest of both countries and their people , they want to look forward and have agreed to work together to iron out matters disagreed upon , " the foreign ministry statement said .
rwanda had once been a part of german east africa , but subsequently became a belgian colony after world war i.
" following this , in a visible sign of resolve , germany and rwanda have agreed to post to each others ' capitals new heads of respective diplomatic missions in the near future . "
german arrest led to extradition to france german police had arrested rose kabuye , 47 , the rwandan regime 's head of protocol , during a visit to germany last november and extradited her to france , where she was wanted on a french terrorism charge .
kabuye had been charged in 2006 for her alleged role in downing a plane that carried former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana , whose death sparked the genocide .
the governing regime had accused the french and other europeans of expending more effort in persecuting the survivors of the tutsi genocide instead of hunting down the perpetrators belonging to the hutu tribe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors laid siege to the german embassy in kigali kabuye 's arrest in germany had caused a furore in kigali , which then simultaneously expelled germany 's ambassador to rwanda and recalled its own ambassador to berlin .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 19.01.2009 brussels paints dark picture of eu economy in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is likely to experience more downs than ups in the coming year the eu is facing a " deep and protracted " recession , according to forecasts made in brussels and released on monday , jan .
19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .
" but a lot of germans do n't trust brussels , and a lot of other people do n't either , so we just have to live with what we 've got . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the western germans are currently placed 11th . " i am glad that a decision about my future has been reached and the speculation about me is over , " podolski said on his home page . podolski said he had good talks with cologne coach christoph daum and general manager michael meier as cologne aim to build a strong team around the popular forward who is their biggest transfer . " the club 's concept convinced me - we want to achieve something over the next years in cologne , " podolski told the cologne website . hometown hero ignores other offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has been eager to return to cologne italy 's roma as well as bundesliga clubs werder bremen and sv hamburg also showed interest in podolski , but all that he wanted was a homecoming to cologne where he played from his youth onwards until 2006 . " i am very happy that lukas returns to us .
he followed his heart , " said cologne president wolfgang overath , himself a former club icon who won the 1974 world cup . munich general manager uli hoeness said that " we granted his request to return to cologne " and expressed his belief that podolski will show character in his final months at the champions .
podolski promised " to fully concentrate on munich until summer . " podolski left for munich after germany 's third-placed finish at the 2006 home world cup but never managed the desired breakthrough there . beckenbauer criticizes poldi 's desire at bayern podolski was rarely fielded as a starter in an attacking lineup boasting italy striker luca toni and germany 's miroslav klose .
with us player landon donovan staying at least until march and ivica olic hired from summer onwards his position would have not improved . podolski 's showings in munich with 11 goals in 58 games stand in sharp contrast to those in the national team where he has netted 31 goals in 60 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said poldi dhould have fought harder munich president franz beckenbauer was among those who criticized podolski for not fighting hard enough for a place in the starting 11 , saying " maybe he gave up a little too early . " but others including germany coach joachim loew said that the chemistry between a club and a player must be right . " he must be at a club where he feels well .
lukas is an emotional person .
he needs cozy surroundings to play at his best .
and if he feels that cologne can offer this then his step is the right one , " loew said last week .
" i told him ' listen to your heart , " ' he added . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .

just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire .

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
whereas if he were granted political asylum in switzerland , he could continue working as a journalist , according to la tribune . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .

putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .

russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .

putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .
but ukraine will pay at discounted prices of 20 per cent on deliveries this year in return for keeping transit fees at 2008 prices , putin said .

russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .
the european union has been hard hit by the gas row since russia cut all supplies via ukraine on january 7 , accusing ukraine of stealing transits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 19.01.2009 brussels paints dark picture of eu economy in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is likely to experience more downs than ups in the coming year the eu is facing a " deep and protracted " recession , according to forecasts made in brussels and released on monday , jan .
19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .
" but a lot of germans do n't trust brussels , and a lot of other people do n't either , so we just have to live with what we 've got . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the western germans are currently placed 11th . " i am glad that a decision about my future has been reached and the speculation about me is over , " podolski said on his home page . podolski said he had good talks with cologne coach christoph daum and general manager michael meier as cologne aim to build a strong team around the popular forward who is their biggest transfer . " the club 's concept convinced me - we want to achieve something over the next years in cologne , " podolski told the cologne website . hometown hero ignores other offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has been eager to return to cologne italy 's roma as well as bundesliga clubs werder bremen and sv hamburg also showed interest in podolski , but all that he wanted was a homecoming to cologne where he played from his youth onwards until 2006 . " i am very happy that lukas returns to us .
he followed his heart , " said cologne president wolfgang overath , himself a former club icon who won the 1974 world cup . munich general manager uli hoeness said that " we granted his request to return to cologne " and expressed his belief that podolski will show character in his final months at the champions .
podolski promised " to fully concentrate on munich until summer . " podolski left for munich after germany 's third-placed finish at the 2006 home world cup but never managed the desired breakthrough there . beckenbauer criticizes poldi 's desire at bayern podolski was rarely fielded as a starter in an attacking lineup boasting italy striker luca toni and germany 's miroslav klose .
with us player landon donovan staying at least until march and ivica olic hired from summer onwards his position would have not improved . podolski 's showings in munich with 11 goals in 58 games stand in sharp contrast to those in the national team where he has netted 31 goals in 60 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said poldi dhould have fought harder munich president franz beckenbauer was among those who criticized podolski for not fighting hard enough for a place in the starting 11 , saying " maybe he gave up a little too early . " but others including germany coach joachim loew said that the chemistry between a club and a player must be right . " he must be at a club where he feels well .
lukas is an emotional person .
he needs cozy surroundings to play at his best .
and if he feels that cologne can offer this then his step is the right one , " loew said last week .
" i told him ' listen to your heart , " ' he added . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a journalist was also shot at the scene and has died of her wounds . stanislav markelov , 34 , had been at the forefront of legal attempts to block the early release of russian colonel yuri budanov , whose case had became a symbol of human rights abuses in chechnya . markelov 's body was found on moscow 's prechistinkaya street , a 10-minute walk from the kremlin , prosecutors in the russian capital said .
he had just finished giving a briefing to reporters . " an assailant ran behind markelov and a woman escorting him , anastasia baburova , and shot him in the back of the head from point-blank range .
the woman tried to get hold of the suspect , but he shot her too , " a law-enforcement source told local media . the gunman escaped after the shooting . anastasia baburova , a 25-year-old freelance journalist worked for the russian opposition newspaper novaya gazeta , was shot in the head .
she was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but has since died of her injuries , according to a spokeswoman for the newspaper . novaya gazeta was also the newspaper which employed anna politkovskaya , the journalist and outspoken kremlin critic murdered in 2006 . " it 's terrible that this has become a greim reality of our life , " said karina moskalenko , a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family .

her family said she had been raped and killed by drunken russian troops . her death became a symbol of russian human rights abuses there . budanov was convicted of the murder in 2003 and jailed for 10 years , the highest-ranking russian officer to be imprisoned for war crimes in chechnya . his early release last thursday triggered a wave of protests in mostly muslim chechnya . marklov had planned to appeal the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg if russia 's supreme court refused to hear a new complaint against budanov 's early release . the interfax news agency reported that kungayeva 's father talked to markelov on friday and that the lawyer said he had been threatened with death unless he dropped the case . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 19.01.2009 russia , ukraine agree to end gas feud but europe still waits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and timoschenko struck an agreement on new gas supply contracts russia and ukraine clinched an agreement monday ending a protracted dispute that froze gas shipments to europe for nearly two weeks but europe was still left wondering when the gas would flow . russian prime minister vladimir putin and his ukrainian counterpart julia timoshenko were shown on russian television presiding over the signing of a new contract on gas prices and transits between the two states ' gas monopolies in moscow .
gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .
" no monitoring system is necessary as ukraine will receive gas for its own needs , " putin said at the ceremony ending the two countries ' gas dispute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said that eu observers were no longer needed both putin and timoshenko said the deal allowed for " subjective " issues to be sidelined from hindering their gas trade in the future .
gas disputes between russia and ukraine have been a chronic end-of- year problem since 2005 when pro-western leaders came to power in ukraine in the so-called orange revolution .
putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .
but ukraine will pay at discounted prices of 20 per cent on deliveries this year in return for keeping transit fees at 2008 prices , putin said .
europe still made to wait for gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could still be waiting for its gas in three-days time under the deal , the two-post soviet countries will deal directly instead of trading though swiss-based intermediary rosukrenergo , which is 50 per cent owned by gazprom .
russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .

large-screen cell phones hang next to conventional keypad phones .
a colorful sign on the door that reads " mobile compost " informs people that they can also turn in their old phone models here .
the box itself is inconspicuous : square , with a see-through window and a slit in the lid .
yasser stan is a salesman in the shop .
he has had good experiences with mobile compost .
it used to be that people wondered what to do with their old mobile phones , he said : " they disposed of the batteries correctly , then they just threw the rest in the plastic recycling . "
valuable metals some people did n't even do that much .
but " when they saw the sign for mobile compost , then they came with their phones the next time , " he said .
anders svensson , who was in the shop to buy a new phone , explained he was keeping his old cell phone because he needed the new one just for work .
when the old phone is no longer in use " then it will probably land in a drawer at home , " he said .
" my daughter can play with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cellphones are collected in the us as well svennson 's plan is not unique : some 15 million old telephones are tucked away in drawers somewhere in sweden .
taken together , cashing them in could be worthwhile .
one ton of cell phones contains a kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of silver and some 300 grams of gold , according to the organization sweden refuse .
it 's a real gold mine , said jan-olof eriksson , whose company el-kretsen collects outdated electrical appliances and recycles them for cash .
" mobile phones are technologically complicated , with a lot of precious metals inside them .
those resources could replace the ones that are taken out of the ground , " he said environmentally friendly at this point , some 40 percent of the gold that swedish mining operation boliden produces comes from recycled electronics .
" its a good use of existing resources , because the materials can be recycled many times , " eriksson said .
what 's more , it 's good for the environment .
a correctly recycled cell phone ca n't release toxic agents into the environment .
mobile compost is in fact a british company that takes the phones apart and recycles them .
three euros -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- from the cost of each phone goes to the development agency plan , which works on environmental projects .
to date , some 250,000 phones were collected .
collecting phones could be a tall order though , says el-kretsen 's eriksson .
" the mobile phone is the best loved piece of electronics equipment after radio and tv , " he said . " it is practical , you can be reached anywhere .
and it offers a load of functions that make your daily life easier .
many people have a little museum at home of all their old cell phones . "
eriksson loves his cell phone - he wo n't be so fast to recycle it , he said .
but the mobile compost initiative is a good way to start changing peoples ' attitudes , he added . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .
" but a lot of germans do n't trust brussels , and a lot of other people do n't either , so we just have to live with what we 've got . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

large-screen cell phones hang next to conventional keypad phones .
a colorful sign on the door that reads " mobile compost " informs people that they can also turn in their old phone models here .
the box itself is inconspicuous : square , with a see-through window and a slit in the lid .
yasser stan is a salesman in the shop .
he has had good experiences with mobile compost .
it used to be that people wondered what to do with their old mobile phones , he said : " they disposed of the batteries correctly , then they just threw the rest in the plastic recycling . "
valuable metals some people did n't even do that much .
but " when they saw the sign for mobile compost , then they came with their phones the next time , " he said .
anders svensson , who was in the shop to buy a new phone , explained he was keeping his old cell phone because he needed the new one just for work .
when the old phone is no longer in use " then it will probably land in a drawer at home , " he said .
" my daughter can play with it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cellphones are collected in the us as well svennson 's plan is not unique : some 15 million old telephones are tucked away in drawers somewhere in sweden .
taken together , cashing them in could be worthwhile .
one ton of cell phones contains a kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of silver and some 300 grams of gold , according to the organization sweden refuse .
it 's a real gold mine , said jan-olof eriksson , whose company el-kretsen collects outdated electrical appliances and recycles them for cash .
" mobile phones are technologically complicated , with a lot of precious metals inside them .
those resources could replace the ones that are taken out of the ground , " he said environmentally friendly at this point , some 40 percent of the gold that swedish mining operation boliden produces comes from recycled electronics .
" its a good use of existing resources , because the materials can be recycled many times , " eriksson said .
what 's more , it 's good for the environment .
a correctly recycled cell phone ca n't release toxic agents into the environment .
mobile compost is in fact a british company that takes the phones apart and recycles them .
three euros -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- from the cost of each phone goes to the development agency plan , which works on environmental projects .
to date , some 250,000 phones were collected .
collecting phones could be a tall order though , says el-kretsen 's eriksson .
" the mobile phone is the best loved piece of electronics equipment after radio and tv , " he said . " it is practical , you can be reached anywhere .
and it offers a load of functions that make your daily life easier .
many people have a little museum at home of all their old cell phones . "
eriksson loves his cell phone - he wo n't be so fast to recycle it , he said .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the western germans are currently placed 11th . " i am glad that a decision about my future has been reached and the speculation about me is over , " podolski said on his home page . podolski said he had good talks with cologne coach christoph daum and general manager michael meier as cologne aim to build a strong team around the popular forward who is their biggest transfer . " the club 's concept convinced me - we want to achieve something over the next years in cologne , " podolski told the cologne website . hometown hero ignores other offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has been eager to return to cologne italy 's roma as well as bundesliga clubs werder bremen and sv hamburg also showed interest in podolski , but all that he wanted was a homecoming to cologne where he played from his youth onwards until 2006 . " i am very happy that lukas returns to us .
he followed his heart , " said cologne president wolfgang overath , himself a former club icon who won the 1974 world cup . munich general manager uli hoeness said that " we granted his request to return to cologne " and expressed his belief that podolski will show character in his final months at the champions .
podolski promised " to fully concentrate on munich until summer . " podolski left for munich after germany 's third-placed finish at the 2006 home world cup but never managed the desired breakthrough there . beckenbauer criticizes poldi 's desire at bayern podolski was rarely fielded as a starter in an attacking lineup boasting italy striker luca toni and germany 's miroslav klose .
with us player landon donovan staying at least until march and ivica olic hired from summer onwards his position would have not improved . podolski 's showings in munich with 11 goals in 58 games stand in sharp contrast to those in the national team where he has netted 31 goals in 60 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said poldi dhould have fought harder munich president franz beckenbauer was among those who criticized podolski for not fighting hard enough for a place in the starting 11 , saying " maybe he gave up a little too early . " but others including germany coach joachim loew said that the chemistry between a club and a player must be right . " he must be at a club where he feels well .
lukas is an emotional person .
he needs cozy surroundings to play at his best .
and if he feels that cologne can offer this then his step is the right one , " loew said last week .

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .

putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .

russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
whereas if he were granted political asylum in switzerland , he could continue working as a journalist , according to la tribune . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a journalist was also shot at the scene and has died of her wounds . stanislav markelov , 34 , had been at the forefront of legal attempts to block the early release of russian colonel yuri budanov , whose case had became a symbol of human rights abuses in chechnya . markelov 's body was found on moscow 's prechistinkaya street , a 10-minute walk from the kremlin , prosecutors in the russian capital said .
he had just finished giving a briefing to reporters . " an assailant ran behind markelov and a woman escorting him , anastasia baburova , and shot him in the back of the head from point-blank range .
the woman tried to get hold of the suspect , but he shot her too , " a law-enforcement source told local media . the gunman escaped after the shooting . anastasia baburova , a 25-year-old freelance journalist worked for the russian opposition newspaper novaya gazeta , was shot in the head .
she was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but has since died of her injuries , according to a spokeswoman for the newspaper . novaya gazeta was also the newspaper which employed anna politkovskaya , the journalist and outspoken kremlin critic murdered in 2006 .

her family said she had been raped and killed by drunken russian troops . her death became a symbol of russian human rights abuses there . budanov was convicted of the murder in 2003 and jailed for 10 years , the highest-ranking russian officer to be imprisoned for war crimes in chechnya . his early release last thursday triggered a wave of protests in mostly muslim chechnya . marklov had planned to appeal the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg if russia 's supreme court refused to hear a new complaint against budanov 's early release . the interfax news agency reported that kungayeva 's father talked to markelov on friday and that the lawyer said he had been threatened with death unless he dropped the case . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

large-screen cell phones hang next to conventional keypad phones .
a colorful sign on the door that reads " mobile compost " informs people that they can also turn in their old phone models here .
the box itself is inconspicuous : square , with a see-through window and a slit in the lid .
yasser stan is a salesman in the shop .
he has had good experiences with mobile compost .
it used to be that people wondered what to do with their old mobile phones , he said : " they disposed of the batteries correctly , then they just threw the rest in the plastic recycling . "
valuable metals some people did n't even do that much .
but " when they saw the sign for mobile compost , then they came with their phones the next time , " he said .
anders svensson , who was in the shop to buy a new phone , explained he was keeping his old cell phone because he needed the new one just for work .
when the old phone is no longer in use " then it will probably land in a drawer at home , " he said .
" my daughter can play with it . "

it 's a real gold mine , said jan-olof eriksson , whose company el-kretsen collects outdated electrical appliances and recycles them for cash .

more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .

just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire .

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
whereas if he were granted political asylum in switzerland , he could continue working as a journalist , according to la tribune . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .
" but a lot of germans do n't trust brussels , and a lot of other people do n't either , so we just have to live with what we 've got . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .

putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .

russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .
" no monitoring system is necessary as ukraine will receive gas for its own needs , " putin said at the ceremony ending the two countries ' gas dispute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said that eu observers were no longer needed both putin and timoshenko said the deal allowed for " subjective " issues to be sidelined from hindering their gas trade in the future .
gas disputes between russia and ukraine have been a chronic end-of- year problem since 2005 when pro-western leaders came to power in ukraine in the so-called orange revolution .
putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .
but ukraine will pay at discounted prices of 20 per cent on deliveries this year in return for keeping transit fees at 2008 prices , putin said .
europe still made to wait for gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could still be waiting for its gas in three-days time under the deal , the two-post soviet countries will deal directly instead of trading though swiss-based intermediary rosukrenergo , which is 50 per cent owned by gazprom .
russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire .

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

large-screen cell phones hang next to conventional keypad phones .

but " when they saw the sign for mobile compost , then they came with their phones the next time , " he said .

mobile compost is in fact a british company that takes the phones apart and recycles them .

one ton of cell phones contains a kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of silver and some 300 grams of gold , according to the organization sweden refuse .
it 's a real gold mine , said jan-olof eriksson , whose company el-kretsen collects outdated electrical appliances and recycles them for cash .
" mobile phones are technologically complicated , with a lot of precious metals inside them .
those resources could replace the ones that are taken out of the ground , " he said environmentally friendly at this point , some 40 percent of the gold that swedish mining operation boliden produces comes from recycled electronics .
" its a good use of existing resources , because the materials can be recycled many times , " eriksson said .
what 's more , it 's good for the environment .
a correctly recycled cell phone ca n't release toxic agents into the environment .
mobile compost is in fact a british company that takes the phones apart and recycles them .

19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .
" but a lot of germans do n't trust brussels , and a lot of other people do n't either , so we just have to live with what we 've got . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .
that is a slight improvement over estimates put forward by some economists over the past few weeks who had predicted the german economy could shrink by as much as four percent in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's forecast germany will see its worst economic contraction in 60 years the commission said germany 's two economic stimulus packages would help the economy weather the worst of the storm .
still , the downturn could turn out to be germany 's worst in more than 60 years . brussels said the euro-zone would not begin to pull itself out of the slump until mid 2009 at the earliest and even then , growth is estimated to only be about 0.5 percent in 2010 . last week , the european central bank cut rates by half a percentage point to two percent in response to the deeping recession .
the stimulus packages launched by european governments in december totalled some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 265 billion -rrb- and since then , some governments , such as germany 's , have announced new stimulus measures or are considering them . national or global approach ? also on monday , uk prime minister gordon brown warned of depending on national plans to attack what is a global crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown wants to see more coordinated action " unless we come together to address these problems in a coordinated way , the world is at risk of a damaging spiral of de-globalizing .
it is fueled by a combination of deleveraging and national-only policy solutions , " he said at a press conference to unveil a second major bank rescue package . that stance gets a nod from many economists , who have criticized some countries , including germany , for being too cautious with their stimulus or of not thinking beyond their own borders .
just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire . " -lrb- berlin -rrb- has realized this is a global crisis , " michael burda , an economist at berlin 's humboldt university , told deutsche welle . berlin 's new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66 billion -rrb- rescue plan mixing infrastructure investments and tax cuts unveiled this month has won praise , including from prime minister brown .
still some economists think a more coordinated eu effort would be more effective in the face of such a large economic meltdown . " it does n't make any sense to have one country doing on its own what it could achieve more efficiently in coordination with other european countries , " burda said .
" but a lot of germans do n't trust brussels , and a lot of other people do n't either , so we just have to live with what we 've got . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
whereas if he were granted political asylum in switzerland , he could continue working as a journalist , according to la tribune . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .
" no monitoring system is necessary as ukraine will receive gas for its own needs , " putin said at the ceremony ending the two countries ' gas dispute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said that eu observers were no longer needed both putin and timoshenko said the deal allowed for " subjective " issues to be sidelined from hindering their gas trade in the future .
gas disputes between russia and ukraine have been a chronic end-of- year problem since 2005 when pro-western leaders came to power in ukraine in the so-called orange revolution .
putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .
but ukraine will pay at discounted prices of 20 per cent on deliveries this year in return for keeping transit fees at 2008 prices , putin said .
europe still made to wait for gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could still be waiting for its gas in three-days time under the deal , the two-post soviet countries will deal directly instead of trading though swiss-based intermediary rosukrenergo , which is 50 per cent owned by gazprom .
russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .
the european union has been hard hit by the gas row since russia cut all supplies via ukraine on january 7 , accusing ukraine of stealing transits .
roughly one quarter of all gas burnt in the eu comes from russia , and 80 per cent of it passes through ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the western germans are currently placed 11th . " i am glad that a decision about my future has been reached and the speculation about me is over , " podolski said on his home page . podolski said he had good talks with cologne coach christoph daum and general manager michael meier as cologne aim to build a strong team around the popular forward who is their biggest transfer . " the club 's concept convinced me - we want to achieve something over the next years in cologne , " podolski told the cologne website . hometown hero ignores other offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has been eager to return to cologne italy 's roma as well as bundesliga clubs werder bremen and sv hamburg also showed interest in podolski , but all that he wanted was a homecoming to cologne where he played from his youth onwards until 2006 . " i am very happy that lukas returns to us .
he followed his heart , " said cologne president wolfgang overath , himself a former club icon who won the 1974 world cup . munich general manager uli hoeness said that " we granted his request to return to cologne " and expressed his belief that podolski will show character in his final months at the champions .
podolski promised " to fully concentrate on munich until summer . " podolski left for munich after germany 's third-placed finish at the 2006 home world cup but never managed the desired breakthrough there . beckenbauer criticizes poldi 's desire at bayern podolski was rarely fielded as a starter in an attacking lineup boasting italy striker luca toni and germany 's miroslav klose .
with us player landon donovan staying at least until march and ivica olic hired from summer onwards his position would have not improved . podolski 's showings in munich with 11 goals in 58 games stand in sharp contrast to those in the national team where he has netted 31 goals in 60 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said poldi dhould have fought harder munich president franz beckenbauer was among those who criticized podolski for not fighting hard enough for a place in the starting 11 , saying " maybe he gave up a little too early . " but others including germany coach joachim loew said that the chemistry between a club and a player must be right . " he must be at a club where he feels well .
lukas is an emotional person .
he needs cozy surroundings to play at his best .
and if he feels that cologne can offer this then his step is the right one , " loew said last week .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election .

both candidates enjoy the same level of popular support , but the spd is lagging far behind the cdu in opinion polls . spd popularity sags in hesse , the spd saw its share of the vote slump to an historic low of 23.7 percent , 13 percentage points less than the previous election in january 2008 when it narrowly failed to unseat incumbent cdu premier roland koch . koch has headed a caretaker administration since then . the cdu polled 37.2 percent , roughly the same as a year ago , and will now be able to form a coalition with its favored partner , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which upped its share to 16.2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu premier roland koch , center , had been leading a caretaker government in hesse fdp leader guido westerwelle called the result " a decisive signal for the general election . "
he said his party would " act responsibly " with the new powers that would soon be at its disposal . with a cdu-fdp alliance in hesse , the two parties will be linked in coalition governments in five of germany 's 16 states , all in the western part of the country . this would deprive merkel 's cdu-spd alliance in berlin of its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which is made up of representatives of the federal states . centrist spd 's ambitions the spd finds itself in a dilemma after repositioning itself as a party of the center last autumn when it ditched embattled rhineland-palatinate premier kurt beck as chairman , dpa news agency reported . analysts said the party has to find a strategy that will allow it to emerge from the shadow of the cdu without pandering too much to voters on the left of the political spectrum , dpa said . this will not be easy in view of opinion polls which show the spd unlikely to win enough votes in september to form a two-way coalition with its preferred partner , the greens . if it makes overtures to the left , which is treated with suspicion among the electorate because of its communist roots , it could risk losing its credibility as a party with centrist ambitions , dpa said . a test will come in august when regional elections take place in saxony , thuringia and saarland .
the left party is strong in all three states and could poll more votes than the spd . no national deal with left : muentefering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with oskar lafontaine 's left party could be a dangerous partnership for spd national chairman muentefering has left it open to spd leaders in the three states to join in a coalition with the left if it would help to get an spd candidate elected state premier . but the spd has so far ruled out a coalition with the left at national level , citing that party 's stance on foreign affairs , particularly its opposition to the presence of german troops in afghanistan . but it might have to rethink this option if the general election in september leaves open the possibility of a three-way coalition between the greens , spd and left , dpa said . a continuation of the present alliance in berlin would also be a possibility if the cdu and fdp fall short of their goal of achieving a parliamentary majority . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the western germans are currently placed 11th . " i am glad that a decision about my future has been reached and the speculation about me is over , " podolski said on his home page . podolski said he had good talks with cologne coach christoph daum and general manager michael meier as cologne aim to build a strong team around the popular forward who is their biggest transfer . " the club 's concept convinced me - we want to achieve something over the next years in cologne , " podolski told the cologne website . hometown hero ignores other offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has been eager to return to cologne italy 's roma as well as bundesliga clubs werder bremen and sv hamburg also showed interest in podolski , but all that he wanted was a homecoming to cologne where he played from his youth onwards until 2006 . " i am very happy that lukas returns to us .
he followed his heart , " said cologne president wolfgang overath , himself a former club icon who won the 1974 world cup . munich general manager uli hoeness said that " we granted his request to return to cologne " and expressed his belief that podolski will show character in his final months at the champions .
podolski promised " to fully concentrate on munich until summer . " podolski left for munich after germany 's third-placed finish at the 2006 home world cup but never managed the desired breakthrough there . beckenbauer criticizes poldi 's desire at bayern podolski was rarely fielded as a starter in an attacking lineup boasting italy striker luca toni and germany 's miroslav klose .
with us player landon donovan staying at least until march and ivica olic hired from summer onwards his position would have not improved . podolski 's showings in munich with 11 goals in 58 games stand in sharp contrast to those in the national team where he has netted 31 goals in 60 caps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said poldi dhould have fought harder munich president franz beckenbauer was among those who criticized podolski for not fighting hard enough for a place in the starting 11 , saying " maybe he gave up a little too early . " but others including germany coach joachim loew said that the chemistry between a club and a player must be right . " he must be at a club where he feels well .
lukas is an emotional person .
he needs cozy surroundings to play at his best .
and if he feels that cologne can offer this then his step is the right one , " loew said last week .

the iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at us president bush last december claims he was tortured in detention at a baghdad prison , which are grounds for seeking asylum in switzerland . an iraqi journalist who made world headlines after throwing his shoes at us president george w. bush at a press conference in mid-december , wants to apply for political asylum in switzerland , his lawyer said on monday .
muntazer al-zaidi , 29 , has been held in detention in iraq awaiting trial since the act , which is regarded as a deep insult in the arab world .
bush , who had led the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , was able to duck the shoes being thrown and was unharmed .
al-zaidi 's lawyer , mauro poggia , confirmed a report in the swiss daily la tribune de geneve that his client would submit an asylum application to the foreign ministry in bern this week .
the lawyer said he had been approached by al-zaidi 's family through the international committee of the red cross and sought asylum on grounds that he feared that his life would be in danger if he were to remain in iraq .
the lawyer said al-zaidi had suffered injuries to his eye , broken ribs and internal bleeding in the baghdad prison .
" even if many iraqis support his act , he is at the mercy of all kinds of extremists ... " he said .
" his life could become hell in his own country . "
the trial of al-zaidi , who never issued an apology , was postponed at the end of last year over a discussion of whether he should be accused of insulting bush or charged with assault . al-zaidi is due to stand trial in iraq for " aggression " and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
whereas if he were granted political asylum in switzerland , he could continue working as a journalist , according to la tribune . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he had just finished giving a briefing to reporters . " an assailant ran behind markelov and a woman escorting him , anastasia baburova , and shot him in the back of the head from point-blank range .
the woman tried to get hold of the suspect , but he shot her too , " a law-enforcement source told local media . the gunman escaped after the shooting . anastasia baburova , a 25-year-old freelance journalist worked for the russian opposition newspaper novaya gazeta , was shot in the head .
she was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but has since died of her injuries , according to a spokeswoman for the newspaper . novaya gazeta was also the newspaper which employed anna politkovskaya , the journalist and outspoken kremlin critic murdered in 2006 .

her family said she had been raped and killed by drunken russian troops . her death became a symbol of russian human rights abuses there . budanov was convicted of the murder in 2003 and jailed for 10 years , the highest-ranking russian officer to be imprisoned for war crimes in chechnya . his early release last thursday triggered a wave of protests in mostly muslim chechnya . marklov had planned to appeal the case to the european court of human rights in strasbourg if russia 's supreme court refused to hear a new complaint against budanov 's early release . the interfax news agency reported that kungayeva 's father talked to markelov on friday and that the lawyer said he had been threatened with death unless he dropped the case . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more economic contraction and rising unemployment are on the horizon , brussels said . the 16 nations which use the euro will see their economies shrink by 1.9 percent , while the eu-wide contraction will be almost as bad at 1.8 percent , according to the european commission , the eu 's executive . those dire numbers are just one portion of a grim tableau the commission presented on monday , describing the economic crisis as the worst faced by the world since world war two , with overall outlook still exceptionally uncertain . " except for government consumption and public investment , all demand components are forecast to put a drag on gdp growth , " the commission said in presenting the forecasts . the current forecast is a dramatic downward revision from previous eu estimates .
the commission 's last estimate in november predicted the euro-zone economy would manage to eke out growth of 0.1 percent . vanishing jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lines at employment centers will likely get longer the economic contraction could lead the eu back to the bad old days of high unemployment , brussels said .
the eu labor market is expected to be hard hit by the global crisis , with 3.5 million jobs disappearing in the eu in 2009 . unemployment hit a record low of 7.2 percent in march last year , but began creeping up as the economic situation darkened .
the jobless rate will likely rise to 9.3 percent this year and reach 10.2 percent in 2010 , the first time unemployment has surpassed 10 percent since 1998 . some eu countries could see jobless rates shoot even higher .
spain , which has been especially affected by the housing market crash , could see its unemployment rate expand from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent next year and reach a breathtaking 18.7 percent in 2010 . germany hit germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , will not be spared the fallout .
the eu predicts its export-heavy economy will contract by 2.3 percent this year .

just months ago , berlin resisted spending large sums on stimulus packages , even criticizing other countries such as the uk for their " crass keysianism . " even after a first stimulus package was put together in november , german chancellor angela merkel was dubbed " madame non " in some european quarters .
that stimulus package was attacked as being too small to give europe 's largest economy the shot in the arm it badly needed . the attitude in berlin toward spending changed as the economic outlook became more dire .

gas flows to europe would resume " shortly " after the contract was signed , the two premiers said earlier .
the european commission demanded to know exactly when russian natural gas taps to europe would be turned back on and said that monitors stood ready to verify supplies .
in a statement , the commission noted that russia and ukraine had earlier monday signed a 10-year contract ending their gas dispute , clearing the way for a renewal of supplies through ukraine to europe .
" we now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed .
our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow , " the eu 's executive arm said .
putin says eu observers no longer needed however , prime minister putin said european experts deployed to monitor gas supplies through ukraine to europe will no longer be needed due to the ending of the two countries ' dispute .
" no monitoring system is necessary as ukraine will receive gas for its own needs , " putin said at the ceremony ending the two countries ' gas dispute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said that eu observers were no longer needed both putin and timoshenko said the deal allowed for " subjective " issues to be sidelined from hindering their gas trade in the future .
gas disputes between russia and ukraine have been a chronic end-of- year problem since 2005 when pro-western leaders came to power in ukraine in the so-called orange revolution .
putin called the deal " a way out of the dead end " of the crisis that has disrupted gas flows to europe since negotiations on a new contract broke down january 1 .
the 10-year contract signed by alexei miller , the head of russian gas export monopoly gazprom , and ukraine 's naftogaz head , oleh dubina , calls for both countries to switch to european market prices in their natural gas trade .
but ukraine will pay at discounted prices of 20 per cent on deliveries this year in return for keeping transit fees at 2008 prices , putin said .
europe still made to wait for gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could still be waiting for its gas in three-days time under the deal , the two-post soviet countries will deal directly instead of trading though swiss-based intermediary rosukrenergo , which is 50 per cent owned by gazprom .
russia cut gas to ukraine after it refused to pay a fixed price of 250 dollars - a huge increase on the $ 179.50 it paid last year .
experts say even after the taps are reopened , it could take up to three days for gas flows to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines .
the european union has been hard hit by the gas row since russia cut all supplies via ukraine on january 7 , accusing ukraine of stealing transits .
roughly one quarter of all gas burnt in the eu comes from russia , and 80 per cent of it passes through ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu commission will also predict when it expects the downturn to end and growth to begin again .

"
such is the feeling of ruth pitter as she boards a plane to be in washington for the inauguration of barack obama as the first black us president .
" i feel this is the time now for my community to really see a change , " she says .
ruth , 47 , is a voluntary worker for an organisation called voscur in bristol .
" i work with people helping them get their voices heard and influence decision-making so it ties in with the whole obama ' yes we can ' ethos , " she said . "
now that the most powerful job in the world is being held by a black man ... we can really believe we can achieve " ruth pitter ruth is emotionally charged ahead of her trip .
it is something she has been looking forward to eagerly since 5 november 2008 , the day of obama 's historic victory in the us presidential election .
" i remember feeling so elated and pinching myself most of the day , being really emotional , crying , " she said .
" at the time i just kept thinking ' gosh it 's just going to be a million times better on the 20th of jan ' and so i 'm still pinching myself now that i 'm going to get on a plane and go . "
ruth grew up in bristol , a city with clear links to its history with the transatlantic slave trade .
as a black child she felt that history affected her future prospects .
" before this i think we 've all been really sceptical about whether we as black people could have positions of power , " she said .
" now that the most powerful job in the world is being held by a black man means we can really believe we can achieve without somebody in the back of your mind saying ' i dunno ' . "
ruth hopes this new feeling of being empowered will fill the minds of the city 's black youth and lead them on to greater things .
" my niece , who is 14 and is completely not interested in politics , texted me on the night before and said : ' i 'm really excited .
i could wake up in the morning and a black man could be in power ' , " said ruth .
" for young people now to see that this man has not just got there by walking into it - he has fought and he has had obstacles put in his way but he still achieved - what more inspiration can they have ? "
valerie mower , 44 , is travelling with ruth . "

she also manages a respite unit for disabled children at the weekends .
" the whole experience of obama getting in and of us going to be among five million people , to be in that crowd and part of history , i think we 're very lucky to have that opportunity , " she said .
while valerie shares ruth 's enthusiasm she is guarded about what can be expected of barack obama in the weeks and months after his inauguration .
" i think he 's been given a poison chalice what with everything that 's going on in the world so i do n't think he 'll be coming in and immediately doing amazing things , " she said .
" i think the amazing thing is the fact he 's got in the white house . "
the ripple effect of having a black man as president has already started to take effect according to miles chambers , 41 , a bristol poet who will also be in washington for the ceremony .
" it 's not just getting into politics , it 's your perception of the world and how white people view you .

the 17th century country pub in buckley , flintshire , has felt the full force of the economic downturn which has hit many small businesses .
licensees anna bell and paul foreman took over the inn , also known as " the trap " , in july 2007 and funded a refit with a secured loan on their home .
it started well , as word spread about its cask ales and home-cooked food , but now it could cease trading within days .
the hope and anchor was once the home of jonathan catherall , one of the main founders of buckley 's brick and pottery industries in the 18th century , but it is the strains on the modern day building industry which could now spell the end for the pub . "
it seems that although we have tried in many numerous ways to think outside the box , in increasing gross profit , we are fighting a losing battle " anna bell , hope and anchor in the last couple of years business was greatly boosted by tradesmen who were working less than a mile away , building 300 houses and apartments .
however , according to ms bell , construction has ground to a halt , and the pub 's takings have dropped by 50 % .
miss bell said : " building stopped .
current trade was lost , from workers to home owners , at the new building sites .
" job losses at the local industrial estates affected lunchtime and teatime trade and generally people from lower and middle income families chose not to come out so often .
" takings have dropped by 50 % approximately and the hoped for expansion in trade never happened as the economic downturn took its toll . "
she said increased fuel , beer and food prices , as well as other problems , " squeezed " the business even further , and the couple now fear they could cease trading at any moment .
she added : " it seems that although we have tried in many numerous ways to think outside the box , in increasing gross profit , we are fighting a losing battle . "
fsb members , wales oct-dec 2008 74 % saw trade decrease 31 % waiting longer for payments 58 % less optimistic after pre-budget report 21 % reduced employee numbers 32 % saw cost of existing finance rise 15 % refused credit by their bank miss bell said the couple were in discussions with their brewery to try and come up with a rescue package .
she said flintshire council was also considering the possibility of increased road signage .
she said : " they are currently reviewing their policy on this at present but it is unlikely to come into effect positively for three to four months .
that will be too late . "
the british beer and pub association said the number of pubs closing each week has now risen to 39 .
julie williams , from llanfairfechan , conwy , wound down two businesses in 2008 and was declared bankrupt .
she said she ran a " successful " day nursery and franchising business , despite having debts of £ 84,000 .
in december 2007 , her bank recalled the debt and she was forced to sell the nursery building , which was also her home .
ms williams said : " once the bank called in the overdraft , that was it .
everything spiralled downhill . "
my business could have kept going but without the banks lending it could n't carry on " julie williams " i was trying to negotiate with the banks , robbing peter to pay paul .
the business was successful , and there was a lot of equity in the building , so there was n't any reason for the bank to worry .
" people talk about the credit crunch beginning last year , but the banks have been wary of lending money for a long time now .
" my business could have kept going , but without the banks lending , it could n't carry on . "
ms williams and a friend who was also made bankrupt are now writing a book in the hope of helping others who experience similar problems .
but 2008 was not all doom and gloom , with some companies expanding despite the downturn .
robin langley runs two hairdressing salons - one for men , in wrexham , which opened in february called ego x for men , and another for women in nearby overton-on-dee called ego xcentric .
despite charging £ 25 for a wet shave and £ 17 for a men 's haircut , he said business is good , and he plans to open another salon in march .
he said the key was offering something a " bit different " , like computer games for clients to play on , and claims his was the first salon in north wales to obtain an alcohol licence .
mr langley said : " it 's about providing a good service and something they wo n't get anywhere else .
" we 're at the luxury end of the market , but people still do n't mind paying for a good service , including the men - the wet shaves are really popular . "
he said utilising the internet by advertising on sites like facebook , and sending customers information by mobile phone text had helped the salons flourish .
he added : " business is really good - long may it continue . "
' full order book ' most other small businesses , however , can only dream of increasing their trade in the current climate .
others though , fear that 2009 could be even worse than last year .
the federation of small businesses -lrb- fsb -rrb- has called on banks to start lending again after an " extremely difficult " year for north wales firms .
with global companies still struggling in the economic downturn , the fsb said there was also " general pessimism " among small firms for 2009 .
many saw slow trade and had difficulty accessing affordable finance last year .
however , the fsb said it was not all bad news , with some small businesses across the region doing well .
the fsb said many of the problems lie with banks ' reluctance to lend money to small businesses .
mike learmond , the fsb 's regional organiser for north wales & chester , said : " i was contacted by a member in gwynedd in the construction industry .
" he told me he had work coming out of his ears , a full order book and a local authority among his clients .
but he had a bit of a problem because he 'd had some late payments .
" he went to the bank that he 's dealt with for many years , but they would n't release any money .
" he said he was told that he filled all the lending criteria , but the bank 's head office had ruled that no money was to be lent to the construction industry , as well as pubs and restaurants .
" i 've heard similar stories from other members . "
gwyn evans , the federation 's chairman for north wales and chester , said the fsb had been successful in persuading councils to pay contractors on time , and encouraging them to use local businesses .

the 17th century country pub in buckley , flintshire , has felt the full force of the economic downturn which has hit many small businesses .
licensees anna bell and paul foreman took over the inn , also known as " the trap " , in july 2007 and funded a refit with a secured loan on their home .
it started well , as word spread about its cask ales and home-cooked food , but now it could cease trading within days .
the hope and anchor was once the home of jonathan catherall , one of the main founders of buckley 's brick and pottery industries in the 18th century , but it is the strains on the modern day building industry which could now spell the end for the pub .
it seems that although we have tried in many numerous ways to think outside the box , in increasing gross profit , we are fighting a losing battle anna bell , hope and anchor in the last couple of years business was greatly boosted by tradesmen who were working less than a mile away , building 300 houses and apartments .
however , according to ms bell , construction has ground to a halt , and the pub 's takings have dropped by 50 % .
miss bell said : " building stopped .
current trade was lost , from workers to home owners , at the new building sites .
" job losses at the local industrial estates affected lunchtime and teatime trade and generally people from lower and middle income families chose not to come out so often .
" takings have dropped by 50 % approximately and the hoped for expansion in trade never happened as the economic downturn took its toll . "
she said increased fuel , beer and food prices , as well as other problems , " squeezed " the business even further , and the couple now fear they could cease trading at any moment .
she added : " it seems that although we have tried in many numerous ways to think outside the box , in increasing gross profit , we are fighting a losing battle . "
fsb members , wales oct-dec 2008 74 % saw trade decrease 31 % waiting longer for payments 58 % less optimistic after pre-budget report 21 % reduced employee numbers 32 % saw cost of existing finance rise 15 % refused credit by their bank miss bell said the couple were in discussions with their brewery to try and come up with a rescue package .
she said flintshire council was also considering the possibility of increased road signage .
she said : " they are currently reviewing their policy on this at present but it is unlikely to come into effect positively for three to four months .
that will be too late . "
the british beer and pub association said the number of pubs closing each week has now risen to 39 .
julie williams , from llanfairfechan , conwy , wound down two businesses in 2008 and was declared bankrupt .
she said she ran a " successful " day nursery and franchising business , despite having debts of £ 84,000 .
in december 2007 , her bank recalled the debt and she was forced to sell the nursery building , which was also her home .
ms williams said : " once the bank called in the overdraft , that was it .
everything spiralled downhill .
my business could have kept going but without the banks lending it could n't carry on julie williams " i was trying to negotiate with the banks , robbing peter to pay paul .
the business was successful , and there was a lot of equity in the building , so there was n't any reason for the bank to worry .
" people talk about the credit crunch beginning last year , but the banks have been wary of lending money for a long time now .
" my business could have kept going , but without the banks lending , it could n't carry on . "
ms williams and a friend who was also made bankrupt are now writing a book in the hope of helping others who experience similar problems .
but 2008 was not all doom and gloom , with some companies expanding despite the downturn .
robin langley runs two hairdressing salons - one for men , in wrexham , which opened in february called ego x for men , and another for women in nearby overton-on-dee called ego xcentric .
despite charging £ 25 for a wet shave and £ 17 for a men 's haircut , he said business is good , and he plans to open another salon in march .
business is so good , robin langley plans to open another salon he said the key was offering something a " bit different " , like computer games for clients to play on , and claims his was the first salon in north wales to obtain an alcohol licence .
mr langley said : " it 's about providing a good service and something they wo n't get anywhere else .
" we 're at the luxury end of the market , but people still do n't mind paying for a good service , including the men - the wet shaves are really popular . "
he said utilising the internet by advertising on sites like facebook , and sending customers information by mobile phone text had helped the salons flourish .
he added : " business is really good - long may it continue . "
' full order book ' most other small businesses , however , can only dream of increasing their trade in the current climate .
others though , fear that 2009 could be even worse than last year .
the federation of small businesses -lrb- fsb -rrb- has called on banks to start lending again after an " extremely difficult " year for north wales firms .
with global companies still struggling in the economic downturn , the fsb said there was also " general pessimism " among small firms for 2009 .
many saw slow trade and had difficulty accessing affordable finance last year .
however , the fsb said it was not all bad news , with some small businesses across the region doing well .
the fsb said many of the problems lie with banks ' reluctance to lend money to small businesses .
mike learmond , the fsb 's regional organiser for north wales & chester , said : " i was contacted by a member in gwynedd in the construction industry .
" he told me he had work coming out of his ears , a full order book and a local authority among his clients .
but he had a bit of a problem because he 'd had some late payments .
" he went to the bank that he 's dealt with for many years , but they would n't release any money .
" he said he was told that he filled all the lending criteria , but the bank 's head office had ruled that no money was to be lent to the construction industry , as well as pubs and restaurants .
" i 've heard similar stories from other members . "
gwyn evans , the federation 's chairman for north wales and chester , said the fsb had been successful in persuading councils to pay contractors on time , and encouraging them to use local businesses .
however , he added : " on the other hand , our members are reporting a downturn in trading , difficulties in accessing affordable finance and general pessimism as we approach 2009 .
" it is vital that the banks start lending again to small and micro businesses . "

the 17th century country pub in buckley , flintshire , has felt the full force of the economic downturn which has hit many small businesses .
licensees anna bell and paul foreman took over the inn , also known as " the trap " , in july 2007 and funded a refit with a secured loan on their home .
it started well , as word spread about its cask ales and home-cooked food , but now it could cease trading within days .
the hope and anchor was once the home of jonathan catherall , one of the main founders of buckley 's brick and pottery industries in the 18th century , but it is the strains on the modern day building industry which could now spell the end for the pub .
it seems that although we have tried in many numerous ways to think outside the box , in increasing gross profit , we are fighting a losing battle anna bell , hope and anchor in the last couple of years business was greatly boosted by tradesmen who were working less than a mile away , building 300 houses and apartments .
however , according to ms bell , construction has ground to a halt , and the pub 's takings have dropped by 50 % .
miss bell said : " building stopped .
current trade was lost , from workers to home owners , at the new building sites .
" job losses at the local industrial estates affected lunchtime and teatime trade and generally people from lower and middle income families chose not to come out so often .
" takings have dropped by 50 % approximately and the hoped for expansion in trade never happened as the economic downturn took its toll . "
she said increased fuel , beer and food prices , as well as other problems , " squeezed " the business even further , and the couple now fear they could cease trading at any moment .
she added : " it seems that although we have tried in many numerous ways to think outside the box , in increasing gross profit , we are fighting a losing battle . "
fsb members , wales oct-dec 2008 74 % saw trade decrease 31 % waiting longer for payments 58 % less optimistic after pre-budget report 21 % reduced employee numbers 32 % saw cost of existing finance rise 15 % refused credit by their bank miss bell said the couple were in discussions with their brewery to try and come up with a rescue package .
she said flintshire council was also considering the possibility of increased road signage .
she said : " they are currently reviewing their policy on this at present but it is unlikely to come into effect positively for three to four months .
that will be too late . "
the british beer and pub association said the number of pubs closing each week has now risen to 39 .
julie williams , from llanfairfechan , conwy , wound down two businesses in 2008 and was declared bankrupt .
she said she ran a " successful " day nursery and franchising business , despite having debts of £ 84,000 .
in december 2007 , her bank recalled the debt and she was forced to sell the nursery building , which was also her home .
ms williams said : " once the bank called in the overdraft , that was it .
everything spiralled downhill .
my business could have kept going but without the banks lending it could n't carry on julie williams " i was trying to negotiate with the banks , robbing peter to pay paul .
the business was successful , and there was a lot of equity in the building , so there was n't any reason for the bank to worry .
" people talk about the credit crunch beginning last year , but the banks have been wary of lending money for a long time now .
" my business could have kept going , but without the banks lending , it could n't carry on . "
ms williams and a friend who was also made bankrupt are now writing a book in the hope of helping others who experience similar problems .
but 2008 was not all doom and gloom , with some companies expanding despite the downturn .
robin langley runs two hairdressing salons - one for men , in wrexham , which opened in february called ego x for men , and another for women in nearby overton-on-dee called ego xcentric .
despite charging £ 25 for a wet shave and £ 17 for a men 's haircut , he said business is good , and he plans to open another salon in march .
business is so good , robin langley plans to open another salon he said the key was offering something a " bit different " , like computer games for clients to play on , and claims his was the first salon in north wales to obtain an alcohol licence .
mr langley said : " it 's about providing a good service and something they wo n't get anywhere else .
" we 're at the luxury end of the market , but people still do n't mind paying for a good service , including the men - the wet shaves are really popular . "
he said utilising the internet by advertising on sites like facebook , and sending customers information by mobile phone text had helped the salons flourish .
he added : " business is really good - long may it continue . "
' full order book ' most other small businesses , however , can only dream of increasing their trade in the current climate .
others though , fear that 2009 could be even worse than last year .
the federation of small businesses -lrb- fsb -rrb- has called on banks to start lending again after an " extremely difficult " year for north wales firms .
with global companies still struggling in the economic downturn , the fsb said there was also " general pessimism " among small firms for 2009 .
many saw slow trade and had difficulty accessing affordable finance last year .
however , the fsb said it was not all bad news , with some small businesses across the region doing well .
the fsb said many of the problems lie with banks ' reluctance to lend money to small businesses .
mike learmond , the fsb 's regional organiser for north wales & chester , said : " i was contacted by a member in gwynedd in the construction industry .
" he told me he had work coming out of his ears , a full order book and a local authority among his clients .
but he had a bit of a problem because he 'd had some late payments .
" he went to the bank that he 's dealt with for many years , but they would n't release any money .
" he said he was told that he filled all the lending criteria , but the bank 's head office had ruled that no money was to be lent to the construction industry , as well as pubs and restaurants .
" i 've heard similar stories from other members . "
gwyn evans , the federation 's chairman for north wales and chester , said the fsb had been successful in persuading councils to pay contractors on time , and encouraging them to use local businesses .
however , he added : " on the other hand , our members are reporting a downturn in trading , difficulties in accessing affordable finance and general pessimism as we approach 2009 .
" it is vital that the banks start lending again to small and micro businesses . "

rspca vets put down gangotri in 2007 on welfare grounds , outraging hindus at the bhaktivedanta manor temple in watford where the cow lived .
now the charity has donated a pregnant cow , aditi , to the manor .
cows are sacred to followers of the hindu religion and hundreds of hindus protested outside rspca headquarters after gangotri 's death .
the cow had been injured for more than a year and suffered from pressure sores because she could no longer stand .
however , campaigners claimed the killing was illegal and took place while members at the temple were at worship - a claim denied by the rspca .
with the donation of aditi , the dispute between the monastery and the charity has come to an end .
a spokesman for the rspca said : " we realise the significance of cows in hindu culture and regret the offence we caused . "
secretary general of the hindu forum of britain , ramesh kallidai , said : " whilst the actions of the rspca did truly hurt the hindu community , i am glad that a suitable solution has been found that allows for all key partners to move forward keeping in mind animal welfare and the sentiments of the hindu community .

rspca vets put down gangotri in 2007 on welfare grounds , outraging hindus at the bhaktivedanta manor temple in watford where the cow lived .
now the charity has donated a pregnant cow , aditi , to the manor .
cows are sacred to followers of the hindu religion and hundreds of hindus protested outside rspca headquarters after gangotri 's death .
the cow had been injured for more than a year and suffered from pressure sores because she could no longer stand .
however , campaigners claimed the killing was illegal and took place while members at the temple were at worship - a claim denied by the rspca .
with the donation of aditi , the dispute between the monastery and the charity has come to an end .
a spokesman for the rspca said : " we realise the significance of cows in hindu culture and regret the offence we caused . "
secretary general of the hindu forum of britain , ramesh kallidai , said : " whilst the actions of the rspca did truly hurt the hindu community , i am glad that a suitable solution has been found that allows for all key partners to move forward keeping in mind animal welfare and the sentiments of the hindu community .

rspca vets put down gangotri in 2007 on welfare grounds , outraging hindus at the bhaktivedanta manor temple in watford where the cow lived .
now the charity has donated a pregnant cow , aditi , to the manor .
cows are sacred to followers of the hindu religion and hundreds of hindus protested outside rspca headquarters after gangotri 's death .
the cow had been injured for more than a year and suffered from pressure sores because she could no longer stand .
however , campaigners claimed the killing was illegal and took place while members at the temple were at worship - a claim denied by the rspca .
with the donation of aditi , the dispute between the monastery and the charity has come to an end .
a spokesman for the rspca said : " we realise the significance of cows in hindu culture and regret the offence we caused . "
secretary general of the hindu forum of britain , ramesh kallidai , said : " whilst the actions of the rspca did truly hurt the hindu community , i am glad that a suitable solution has been found that allows for all key partners to move forward keeping in mind animal welfare and the sentiments of the hindu community .

russell brand kicked off his uk stand-up tour in reading on sunday night .
the former bbc radio 2 dj put the media furore over his phone calls to the actor andrew sachs at the heart of his routine .
it 's a show where brand is both clearly enjoying the headline buzz he has created but is at the same time utterly bewildered by it all .
" we 're like two idiots dancing towards a canyon , " is brand 's assessment as he plays the now infamous video of him and jonathan ross singing an apology onto the fawlty towers star 's answering machine .
but what really upsets brand is that no-one appreciated the rhyming on " consensual " and " menstrual " that he says he " made up on the spot " .
brand 's new uk show - titled scandalous - is starting to tour the country in the same week that ross resumes his bbc shows after a 12-week suspension . "
there was no malice , i just did n't account for people taking it seriously " russell brand seeing brand swagger on stage in floppy boots , a tight biker jacket and a little black dress to the tune of ac / dc 's back in black , the audience is left in no doubt that he is n't here to issue a grovelling apology .
but - to borrow a line from that myth about the male psyche - brand clearly thinks about sachs every six seconds .
' i am the news ! '
the show 's first 25 minutes or so are taken up purely by the sachs affair , interspersed with brand showing clips from news bulletins .
" thank you for coming to see me in a medium in which i still flourish , " he twinkles foppishly .
while brand seems genuinely surprised by the media storm , he pins much of his behaviour on his " mental illness " .
" there was no malice , " he says .
" i just did n't account for people taking it seriously . "
one of the biggest cheers of the night is when brand dances around the stage singing " i am the news ! " along to the news at ten theme .
he points to news footage of himself leaving his house surrounded by photographers : " i look like a bearded hostage . "
and then viewing a headline about how an out-of-work russell brand lookalike has become " another victim " of the phone call scandal , brand explodes : " victim ?
i 'm not harold shipman ! "
death threats brand brings this part of the show to a climax by reading out posts from the times website which highlight the absurdity of some of the public reaction .
it leads to some surreal flights of fantasy as brand acts out scenarios suggested for him by apoplectic readers .
the evening is not just about sachsgate , but there is an over-arching theme about how the media and public have reacted to brand 's unique style .
nowhere is this funnier than when he recounts his experiences as a host at the mtv music video awards .
his jokes about george w bush and the jonas brothers bombed in the us and made global headlines .
there were a few death threats too , which the comedian duly reads out .
" my personality does n't work without fame , " says brand in a flash of self-awareness , before launching into an anecdote about meeting britney spears and an elephant .
as stand-up gigs go , this is about as ego-centric as they come .
and with what 's happened to brand in the past few months , the show feels like it wrote itself .
brand must be hoping for a less headline-grabbing 2009 .

russell brand kicked off his uk stand-up tour in reading on sunday night .
the former bbc radio 2 dj put the media furore over his phone calls to the actor andrew sachs at the heart of his routine .
it 's a show where brand is both clearly enjoying the headline buzz he has created but is at the same time utterly bewildered by it all .
" we 're like two idiots dancing towards a canyon , " is brand 's assessment as he plays the now infamous video of him and jonathan ross singing an apology onto the fawlty towers star 's answering machine .
but what really upsets brand is that no-one appreciated the rhyming on " consensual " and " menstrual " that he says he " made up on the spot " .
brand 's new uk show - titled scandalous - is starting to tour the country in the same week that ross resumes his bbc shows after a 12-week suspension .
there was no malice , i just did n't account for people taking it seriously russell brand seeing brand swagger on stage in floppy boots , a tight biker jacket and a little black dress to the tune of ac / dc 's back in black , the audience is left in no doubt that he is n't here to issue a grovelling apology .
but - to borrow a line from that myth about the male psyche - brand clearly thinks about sachs every six seconds .
' i am the news ! '
the show 's first 25 minutes or so are taken up purely by the sachs affair , interspersed with brand showing clips from news bulletins .
" thank you for coming to see me in a medium in which i still flourish , " he twinkles foppishly .
while brand seems genuinely surprised by the media storm , he pins much of his behaviour on his " mental illness " .
" there was no malice , " he says .
" i just did n't account for people taking it seriously . "
ross and brand both apologised for their behaviour over the incident one of the biggest cheers of the night is when brand dances around the stage singing " i am the news ! " along to the news at ten theme .
he points to news footage of himself leaving his house surrounded by photographers : " i look like a bearded hostage . "
and then viewing a headline about how an out-of-work russell brand lookalike has become " another victim " of the phone call scandal , brand explodes : " victim ?
i 'm not harold shipman ! "
death threats brand brings this part of the show to a climax by reading out posts from the times website which highlight the absurdity of some of the public reaction .
it leads to some surreal flights of fantasy as brand acts out scenarios suggested for him by apoplectic readers .
the evening is not just about sachsgate , but there is an over-arching theme about how the media and public have reacted to brand 's unique style .
nowhere is this funnier than when he recounts his experiences as a host at the mtv music video awards .
his jokes about george w bush and the jonas brothers bombed in the us and made global headlines .
there were a few death threats too , which the comedian duly reads out .
" my personality does n't work without fame , " says brand in a flash of self-awareness , before launching into an anecdote about meeting britney spears and an elephant .
as stand-up gigs go , this is about as ego-centric as they come .
and with what 's happened to brand in the past few months , the show feels like it wrote itself .
brand must be hoping for a less headline-grabbing 2009 .

death threats brand brings this part of the show to a climax by reading out posts from the times website which highlight the absurdity of some of the public reaction .
it leads to some surreal flights of fantasy as brand acts out scenarios suggested for him by apoplectic readers .
the evening is not just about sachsgate , but there is an over-arching theme about how the media and public have reacted to brand 's unique style .
nowhere is this funnier than when he recounts his experiences as a host at the mtv music video awards .
his jokes about george w bush and the jonas brothers bombed in the us and made global headlines .
there were a few death threats too , which the comedian duly reads out .
" my personality does n't work without fame , " says brand in a flash of self-awareness , before launching into an anecdote about meeting britney spears and an elephant .
as stand-up gigs go , this is about as ego-centric as they come .
and with what 's happened to brand in the past few months , the show feels like it wrote itself .
brand must be hoping for a less headline-grabbing 2009 .
