'
georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .

georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .

the announcement by the cia is latest reversal of terrorism policy by the new us administration . " the cia no longer operates detention facilities or black sites and has proposed a plan to decommission the remaining sites , " cia director leon panetta said in a letter to staff that was released on the cia 's website .
" i have directed our agency personnel to take charge of the decommissioning process and have further directed that the contracts for site security be promptly terminated , " he said .
panetta said the cia still reserved the right to hold suspects for a brief period before handing them over to military authorities .
the cia statement is said to confirm that the spy service was carrying out an order from president barack obama to shut down the secret detention centres .
human-rights groups have condemned the treatment of al-qaeda terrorist suspects in secret cia prisons in foreign countries .
rights groups and media reports have alleged the secret prisons were located in central and eastern europe , including poland , romania and in former yugoslavia , as well as in the horn of africa and on us navy ships .
obama pledges to reverse bush 's policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama , with cia chief leon panetta -lrb- r . -rrb- , says the us " does not torture " obama has already ordered the eventual closure of the controversial prison camp in guantanamo bay , cuba , and repealed some of the harsh interrogation tactics used under president george w bush while repeating his mantra that the united states " does not torture . "
in 2006 , bush first acknowledged the existence of the secret prisons , which were used to hold high-profile suspects including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the prisons ' existence caused problems for some governments in europe and asia who allegedly were aware of the facilities .
a european union report in 2007 singled out poland and romania for allowing cia prisons on their soil from between 2002 and 2005 , although both denied any knowledge .
red cross accuses cia of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the policies of the bush administration have been widely condemned the harsh methods employed under the bush administration , including simulated drowning or " waterboarding " of detainees , were widely condemned as torture and abuse .
an internal report leaked last month from the international committee of the red cross said the cia 's interrogations amounted to torture . the report concluded that the treatment of inmates at black sites run by the cia amounted to " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " prohibited by the geneva conventions .
the conclusions by icrc officials came after they were granted exclusive access to the cia 's " high-value " detainees who had been transferred in 2006 to the guantanamo bay prison . nda / wl / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.04.2009 moldovan president agrees to election recount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders say the election was fraudulent moldovan president vladimir voronin has called for a full recount of sunday 's parliamentary election , which was marred by claims of voter fraud .
he claims it will help restore stability to his country . bowing to a key demand of protesters who say the ruling communist party rigged results , voronin said in an official statement : " i am convinced that a complete recount of votes will become a major argument for maintaining political stability , peace and mutual trust in moldova " .
violent opposition protests - with crowds of students in the former soviet republic denouncing alleged election fraud - smashed their way into the parliament and set it ablaze on tuesday .
the authorities responded with a crackdown and mass arrests .
the riots left more than 90 people injured and led to 200 arrests .
moldova 's central electoral commission had announced the communist party lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections , winning just under 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member parliament .
that was revised down from an initial count of 61 seats .
this means the communists do n't have enough seats in parliament to appoint the president , but they still won the election .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
more student protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist students have voiced their opinions in street protests some 200 anti-communist protestors gathered for a rally in the moldovan capital , chisinau , on friday , calling for the resignation of the communist government .
standing in front of the government building , with many holding romanian flags , the protesters chanted slogans such as " down with the communists " and " resignation . "
it was unclear whether they were aware of president voronin 's call for an election recount .
prime minister zinaida greceanii has urged students to stay away from the rally .
european union urges normal relations with romania president voronin had blamed moldova 's neighbour romania for stirring up the riots and ordered the expulsion of the romanian ambassador - sparking an unprecedented diplomatic row with the new eu member .
meanwhile , the european union has urged moldova to resume normal relations with romania .
in a statement by the foreign ministers of france , the czech republic and sweden , the 27-member bloc said it remains ready to work with moldova in accordance with european values and principles .
it stressed the need to maintain good ties with all its neighbors and urged that country to respect all constitutional freedoms .
russia 's slams moldovan protests moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
political analysts says the violent protests have triggered memories of street rallies in ex-soviet republics ukraine and georgia that toppled pro-moscow regimes , and raised fears that young russian crowds might one day slip out of the kremlin 's control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's lavrov is keeping an eye on developments " the moscow authorities are afraid of spontaneous mass protests in the regions ... and for this reason russian television is showing what is happening in an exclusively negative light , " dmitry oreshkin , a moscow-based political analyst told reuters .
foreign minister sergei lavrov described the young moldovan protesters who ransacked buildings as " pogrom-makers " set on destroying the country .
he 's also warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow . cg , jen afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he claims it will help restore stability to his country . bowing to a key demand of protesters who say the ruling communist party rigged results , voronin said in an official statement : " i am convinced that a complete recount of votes will become a major argument for maintaining political stability , peace and mutual trust in moldova " .
violent opposition protests - with crowds of students in the former soviet republic denouncing alleged election fraud - smashed their way into the parliament and set it ablaze on tuesday .
the authorities responded with a crackdown and mass arrests .
the riots left more than 90 people injured and led to 200 arrests .
moldova 's central electoral commission had announced the communist party lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections , winning just under 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member parliament .
that was revised down from an initial count of 61 seats .
this means the communists do n't have enough seats in parliament to appoint the president , but they still won the election .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
more student protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist students have voiced their opinions in street protests some 200 anti-communist protestors gathered for a rally in the moldovan capital , chisinau , on friday , calling for the resignation of the communist government .

prime minister zinaida greceanii has urged students to stay away from the rally .
european union urges normal relations with romania president voronin had blamed moldova 's neighbour romania for stirring up the riots and ordered the expulsion of the romanian ambassador - sparking an unprecedented diplomatic row with the new eu member .
meanwhile , the european union has urged moldova to resume normal relations with romania .
in a statement by the foreign ministers of france , the czech republic and sweden , the 27-member bloc said it remains ready to work with moldova in accordance with european values and principles .
it stressed the need to maintain good ties with all its neighbors and urged that country to respect all constitutional freedoms .

the two german sides dispatched their opponents 3-1 in their quarterfinal first leg matches . an all german uefa cup semifinal match-up is now looking very likely .
the two bundesliga soccer sides left in the competition scored convincing first leg victories in the last eight .
both werder bremen and hamburg beat their opposition 3-1 on home turf on thursday .
the german teams will face each other in the semifinal , if they both progress , and thursday 's wins are big steps in the right direction .
one evening after bayern munich - the richest and most successful club in germany - were pummeled 4-0 by barcelona in the champions league , werder bremen and hamburg did what they could to restore the reputation and pride of the german teams in european competition .
talisman trochowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trochowski also plies his trade for the german national side hamburg secured their 3-1 win despite falling behind to manchester city early on .
it took city 's steve ireland just 34 seconds to find the net from close range , but this goal turned out to be the catalyst for an impressive attacking performance from the hosts , hamburg .
man city goalkeeper shay given was immediately called into action , saving brilliantly from david jarolim , mladen petric and then michael gravgaard as hamburg pushed for the equalizer .
defender joris mathijsen eventually put the match all square in the ninth minute , heading home a corner from german international piotr trochowski .
trochowski scored the next one himself , slotting home a penalty shortly after the hour mark , and the winger later set up substitute jose paolo guerrero to make it 3-1 with a little over 10 minutes left in the match .
since the departure of dutch international rafael van der vaart over the summer , trochowski has established himself as the new playmaker in hsv 's midfield .
trochowski and his teammates travel to manchester next week to try to defend their lead .
city have been inconsistent this season , but with big name players like brazilian forward robinho in their lineup , they certainly have the firepower to cause hamburg problems in the second leg .
double for diego bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumour has it diego might be moving to italy in the summer another midfield maestro was instrumental in werder bremen 's 3-1 win against italian outfit udinese .
brazilian playmaker diego notched two goals for bremen , as udinese failed to close down the dangerous number 10 in the final third of the pitch .
diego 's first strike - an angled drive from the edge of the box - came after 34 minutes .
then , midway through the second half , he curled home another shot from just inside the penalty area .
portuguese forward hugo almeida made it 3-0 moments later , after racing clear of the udinese defense .
however , the visitors rallied to get a goal back in the dying moments through fabio quagliarella , an away goal that gives the italians a glimmer of hope for the second leg .
sparing the bundesliga 's blushes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann wants more from his players , bayern fans want more from him these two convincing home wins have helped restore the reputation of german club teams in europe , after bayern munich were destroyed 4-0 by barcelona in the champions league on wednesday night .
bayern are the last german team left in european soccer 's premier competition , but barring a minor miracle in the second leg , their run in the tournament is now at an end .
last weekend , bayern were dismantled 5-1 in the bundesliga at the hands of wolfsburg .
now , after two humiliating defeats in succession , rumour has it that coach juergen klinsmann could soon be out of a job .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper is reporting that it is " as good as certain " that klinsmann and bayern will part ways this summer , if not before .
klinsmann , who coached the german national side in the 2006 world cup , says he has no intention of stepping down .
defending bundesliga champions bayern are currently fourth in the german league table with 48 points , three adrift of the leaders wolfsburg .
hamburg are second , trailing wolfsburg on goal difference only , and they 'll be hoping that their european adventure does n't put them off their domestic title charge . as for werder bremen , european football looks like their best chance at lifting silverware this season - they are currently mired in 10th position as we near the end of a disappointing and inconsistent bundesliga season . msh / nrt , dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the extra money would go to the missions in afghanistan and iraq . us president barack obama has requested an extra 83.4 billion dollars -lrb- over 63 billion euros -rrb- to fund the wars in iraq and afghanistan this year .
in a letter to his top democratic ally in the house of representatives , speaker nancy pelosi , obama says the money is necessary to counter threats from al-qaeda and a resurgent taliban .
he called for the emergency spending measure to be passed through the house as quickly as possible .
" we face a security situation in afghanistan and pakistan that demands urgent attention , " he writes in the letter .
" the taliban is resurgent and al-qaeda threatens america from its safe have along the afghan-pakistan border . "
the supplemental funding package also includes items not related to the two conflicts , including security and counter-narcotics operations on the mexican border and around 7.1 billion dollars in international aid , with pakistan , the gaza strip , georgia and the un among the major beneficiaries .
however , obama stressed that " nearly 95 % of these funds will be used to support our men and women in uniform as they help the people of iraq to take responsibility for their own future - and work to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . "
likely to pass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the us has spent almost a trillion dollars on war since 9/11 if the supplementary request is approved that would increase the funds set aside for war by washington in 2009 to roughly 150 billion dollars .
as a " supplemental " request , this cash injection would fall outside the standard us budget .
the supplemental request is expected to pass through the house of representatives with relative ease , as obama can probably rely on many opposition republicans to support the bill .
however , the measure has drawn criticism from the ranks of obama 's democrat party .
the administration of former president george w. bush was widely criticized for using such supplemental requests to fund the wars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.04.2009 us considers adopting german-style car-scrapping subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investing five billion euros in car wrecking subsidies as us lawmakers discuss the creation of their own system of auto trade-in subsidies , critics of the scheme here in germany are questioning the motivations of decision-makers in berlin . for many germans the government 's car scrapping incentive program is a dream come true .
they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.04.2009 moldovan president agrees to election recount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders say the election was fraudulent moldovan president vladimir voronin has called for a full recount of sunday 's parliamentary election , which was marred by claims of voter fraud .
he claims it will help restore stability to his country . bowing to a key demand of protesters who say the ruling communist party rigged results , voronin said in an official statement : " i am convinced that a complete recount of votes will become a major argument for maintaining political stability , peace and mutual trust in moldova " .
violent opposition protests - with crowds of students in the former soviet republic denouncing alleged election fraud - smashed their way into the parliament and set it ablaze on tuesday .
the authorities responded with a crackdown and mass arrests .
the riots left more than 90 people injured and led to 200 arrests .
moldova 's central electoral commission had announced the communist party lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections , winning just under 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member parliament .
that was revised down from an initial count of 61 seats .
this means the communists do n't have enough seats in parliament to appoint the president , but they still won the election .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
more student protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist students have voiced their opinions in street protests some 200 anti-communist protestors gathered for a rally in the moldovan capital , chisinau , on friday , calling for the resignation of the communist government .
standing in front of the government building , with many holding romanian flags , the protesters chanted slogans such as " down with the communists " and " resignation . "
it was unclear whether they were aware of president voronin 's call for an election recount .
prime minister zinaida greceanii has urged students to stay away from the rally .
european union urges normal relations with romania president voronin had blamed moldova 's neighbour romania for stirring up the riots and ordered the expulsion of the romanian ambassador - sparking an unprecedented diplomatic row with the new eu member .
meanwhile , the european union has urged moldova to resume normal relations with romania .
in a statement by the foreign ministers of france , the czech republic and sweden , the 27-member bloc said it remains ready to work with moldova in accordance with european values and principles .
it stressed the need to maintain good ties with all its neighbors and urged that country to respect all constitutional freedoms .
russia 's slams moldovan protests moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
political analysts says the violent protests have triggered memories of street rallies in ex-soviet republics ukraine and georgia that toppled pro-moscow regimes , and raised fears that young russian crowds might one day slip out of the kremlin 's control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's lavrov is keeping an eye on developments " the moscow authorities are afraid of spontaneous mass protests in the regions ... and for this reason russian television is showing what is happening in an exclusively negative light , " dmitry oreshkin , a moscow-based political analyst told reuters .
foreign minister sergei lavrov described the young moldovan protesters who ransacked buildings as " pogrom-makers " set on destroying the country .
he 's also warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow . cg , jen afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.04.2009 us considers adopting german-style car-scrapping subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investing five billion euros in car wrecking subsidies as us lawmakers discuss the creation of their own system of auto trade-in subsidies , critics of the scheme here in germany are questioning the motivations of decision-makers in berlin . for many germans the government 's car scrapping incentive program is a dream come true .
they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.04.2009 us considers adopting german-style car-scrapping subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investing five billion euros in car wrecking subsidies as us lawmakers discuss the creation of their own system of auto trade-in subsidies , critics of the scheme here in germany are questioning the motivations of decision-makers in berlin . for many germans the government 's car scrapping incentive program is a dream come true .
they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .

most of the extra money would go to the missions in afghanistan and iraq . us president barack obama has requested an extra 83.4 billion dollars -lrb- over 63 billion euros -rrb- to fund the wars in iraq and afghanistan this year .
in a letter to his top democratic ally in the house of representatives , speaker nancy pelosi , obama says the money is necessary to counter threats from al-qaeda and a resurgent taliban .
he called for the emergency spending measure to be passed through the house as quickly as possible .
" we face a security situation in afghanistan and pakistan that demands urgent attention , " he writes in the letter .
" the taliban is resurgent and al-qaeda threatens america from its safe have along the afghan-pakistan border . "
the supplemental funding package also includes items not related to the two conflicts , including security and counter-narcotics operations on the mexican border and around 7.1 billion dollars in international aid , with pakistan , the gaza strip , georgia and the un among the major beneficiaries .
however , obama stressed that " nearly 95 % of these funds will be used to support our men and women in uniform as they help the people of iraq to take responsibility for their own future - and work to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . "
likely to pass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the us has spent almost a trillion dollars on war since 9/11 if the supplementary request is approved that would increase the funds set aside for war by washington in 2009 to roughly 150 billion dollars .
as a " supplemental " request , this cash injection would fall outside the standard us budget .
the supplemental request is expected to pass through the house of representatives with relative ease , as obama can probably rely on many opposition republicans to support the bill .
however , the measure has drawn criticism from the ranks of obama 's democrat party .
the administration of former president george w. bush was widely criticized for using such supplemental requests to fund the wars .
both democrats and republicans said such urgent requests faced less scrutiny than the regular budget .

the two german sides dispatched their opponents 3-1 in their quarterfinal first leg matches . an all german uefa cup semifinal match-up is now looking very likely .
the two bundesliga soccer sides left in the competition scored convincing first leg victories in the last eight .
both werder bremen and hamburg beat their opposition 3-1 on home turf on thursday .
the german teams will face each other in the semifinal , if they both progress , and thursday 's wins are big steps in the right direction .
one evening after bayern munich - the richest and most successful club in germany - were pummeled 4-0 by barcelona in the champions league , werder bremen and hamburg did what they could to restore the reputation and pride of the german teams in european competition .
talisman trochowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trochowski also plies his trade for the german national side hamburg secured their 3-1 win despite falling behind to manchester city early on .
it took city 's steve ireland just 34 seconds to find the net from close range , but this goal turned out to be the catalyst for an impressive attacking performance from the hosts , hamburg .
man city goalkeeper shay given was immediately called into action , saving brilliantly from david jarolim , mladen petric and then michael gravgaard as hamburg pushed for the equalizer .
defender joris mathijsen eventually put the match all square in the ninth minute , heading home a corner from german international piotr trochowski .
trochowski scored the next one himself , slotting home a penalty shortly after the hour mark , and the winger later set up substitute jose paolo guerrero to make it 3-1 with a little over 10 minutes left in the match .
since the departure of dutch international rafael van der vaart over the summer , trochowski has established himself as the new playmaker in hsv 's midfield .
trochowski and his teammates travel to manchester next week to try to defend their lead .
city have been inconsistent this season , but with big name players like brazilian forward robinho in their lineup , they certainly have the firepower to cause hamburg problems in the second leg .
double for diego bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumour has it diego might be moving to italy in the summer another midfield maestro was instrumental in werder bremen 's 3-1 win against italian outfit udinese .
brazilian playmaker diego notched two goals for bremen , as udinese failed to close down the dangerous number 10 in the final third of the pitch .
diego 's first strike - an angled drive from the edge of the box - came after 34 minutes .
then , midway through the second half , he curled home another shot from just inside the penalty area .
portuguese forward hugo almeida made it 3-0 moments later , after racing clear of the udinese defense .
however , the visitors rallied to get a goal back in the dying moments through fabio quagliarella , an away goal that gives the italians a glimmer of hope for the second leg .
sparing the bundesliga 's blushes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann wants more from his players , bayern fans want more from him these two convincing home wins have helped restore the reputation of german club teams in europe , after bayern munich were destroyed 4-0 by barcelona in the champions league on wednesday night .
bayern are the last german team left in european soccer 's premier competition , but barring a minor miracle in the second leg , their run in the tournament is now at an end .
last weekend , bayern were dismantled 5-1 in the bundesliga at the hands of wolfsburg .
now , after two humiliating defeats in succession , rumour has it that coach juergen klinsmann could soon be out of a job .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper is reporting that it is " as good as certain " that klinsmann and bayern will part ways this summer , if not before .
klinsmann , who coached the german national side in the 2006 world cup , says he has no intention of stepping down .
defending bundesliga champions bayern are currently fourth in the german league table with 48 points , three adrift of the leaders wolfsburg .
hamburg are second , trailing wolfsburg on goal difference only , and they 'll be hoping that their european adventure does n't put them off their domestic title charge . as for werder bremen , european football looks like their best chance at lifting silverware this season - they are currently mired in 10th position as we near the end of a disappointing and inconsistent bundesliga season . msh / nrt , dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talisman trochowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trochowski also plies his trade for the german national side hamburg secured their 3-1 win despite falling behind to manchester city early on .
it took city 's steve ireland just 34 seconds to find the net from close range , but this goal turned out to be the catalyst for an impressive attacking performance from the hosts , hamburg .
man city goalkeeper shay given was immediately called into action , saving brilliantly from david jarolim , mladen petric and then michael gravgaard as hamburg pushed for the equalizer .
defender joris mathijsen eventually put the match all square in the ninth minute , heading home a corner from german international piotr trochowski .
trochowski scored the next one himself , slotting home a penalty shortly after the hour mark , and the winger later set up substitute jose paolo guerrero to make it 3-1 with a little over 10 minutes left in the match .
since the departure of dutch international rafael van der vaart over the summer , trochowski has established himself as the new playmaker in hsv 's midfield .
trochowski and his teammates travel to manchester next week to try to defend their lead .
city have been inconsistent this season , but with big name players like brazilian forward robinho in their lineup , they certainly have the firepower to cause hamburg problems in the second leg .
double for diego bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumour has it diego might be moving to italy in the summer another midfield maestro was instrumental in werder bremen 's 3-1 win against italian outfit udinese .
brazilian playmaker diego notched two goals for bremen , as udinese failed to close down the dangerous number 10 in the final third of the pitch .
diego 's first strike - an angled drive from the edge of the box - came after 34 minutes .
then , midway through the second half , he curled home another shot from just inside the penalty area .
portuguese forward hugo almeida made it 3-0 moments later , after racing clear of the udinese defense .
however , the visitors rallied to get a goal back in the dying moments through fabio quagliarella , an away goal that gives the italians a glimmer of hope for the second leg .

bayern are the last german team left in european soccer 's premier competition , but barring a minor miracle in the second leg , their run in the tournament is now at an end .
last weekend , bayern were dismantled 5-1 in the bundesliga at the hands of wolfsburg .
now , after two humiliating defeats in succession , rumour has it that coach juergen klinsmann could soon be out of a job .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper is reporting that it is " as good as certain " that klinsmann and bayern will part ways this summer , if not before .

defending bundesliga champions bayern are currently fourth in the german league table with 48 points , three adrift of the leaders wolfsburg .
hamburg are second , trailing wolfsburg on goal difference only , and they 'll be hoping that their european adventure does n't put them off their domestic title charge . as for werder bremen , european football looks like their best chance at lifting silverware this season - they are currently mired in 10th position as we near the end of a disappointing and inconsistent bundesliga season . msh / nrt , dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the extra money would go to the missions in afghanistan and iraq . us president barack obama has requested an extra 83.4 billion dollars -lrb- over 63 billion euros -rrb- to fund the wars in iraq and afghanistan this year .
in a letter to his top democratic ally in the house of representatives , speaker nancy pelosi , obama says the money is necessary to counter threats from al-qaeda and a resurgent taliban .
he called for the emergency spending measure to be passed through the house as quickly as possible .
" we face a security situation in afghanistan and pakistan that demands urgent attention , " he writes in the letter .
" the taliban is resurgent and al-qaeda threatens america from its safe have along the afghan-pakistan border . "
the supplemental funding package also includes items not related to the two conflicts , including security and counter-narcotics operations on the mexican border and around 7.1 billion dollars in international aid , with pakistan , the gaza strip , georgia and the un among the major beneficiaries .
however , obama stressed that " nearly 95 % of these funds will be used to support our men and women in uniform as they help the people of iraq to take responsibility for their own future - and work to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan . "

as a " supplemental " request , this cash injection would fall outside the standard us budget .
the supplemental request is expected to pass through the house of representatives with relative ease , as obama can probably rely on many opposition republicans to support the bill .
however , the measure has drawn criticism from the ranks of obama 's democrat party .
the administration of former president george w. bush was widely criticized for using such supplemental requests to fund the wars .

likely to pass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the us has spent almost a trillion dollars on war since 9/11 if the supplementary request is approved that would increase the funds set aside for war by washington in 2009 to roughly 150 billion dollars .
as a " supplemental " request , this cash injection would fall outside the standard us budget .
the supplemental request is expected to pass through the house of representatives with relative ease , as obama can probably rely on many opposition republicans to support the bill .
however , the measure has drawn criticism from the ranks of obama 's democrat party .
the administration of former president george w. bush was widely criticized for using such supplemental requests to fund the wars .
both democrats and republicans said such urgent requests faced less scrutiny than the regular budget .
obama promised that thrusday 's request was " the last planned supplemental " . msh / nrt , reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.04.2009 moldovan president agrees to election recount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders say the election was fraudulent moldovan president vladimir voronin has called for a full recount of sunday 's parliamentary election , which was marred by claims of voter fraud .
he claims it will help restore stability to his country . bowing to a key demand of protesters who say the ruling communist party rigged results , voronin said in an official statement : " i am convinced that a complete recount of votes will become a major argument for maintaining political stability , peace and mutual trust in moldova " .
violent opposition protests - with crowds of students in the former soviet republic denouncing alleged election fraud - smashed their way into the parliament and set it ablaze on tuesday .
the authorities responded with a crackdown and mass arrests .
the riots left more than 90 people injured and led to 200 arrests .
moldova 's central electoral commission had announced the communist party lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections , winning just under 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member parliament .
that was revised down from an initial count of 61 seats .
this means the communists do n't have enough seats in parliament to appoint the president , but they still won the election .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
more student protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist students have voiced their opinions in street protests some 200 anti-communist protestors gathered for a rally in the moldovan capital , chisinau , on friday , calling for the resignation of the communist government .
standing in front of the government building , with many holding romanian flags , the protesters chanted slogans such as " down with the communists " and " resignation . "
it was unclear whether they were aware of president voronin 's call for an election recount .
prime minister zinaida greceanii has urged students to stay away from the rally .
european union urges normal relations with romania president voronin had blamed moldova 's neighbour romania for stirring up the riots and ordered the expulsion of the romanian ambassador - sparking an unprecedented diplomatic row with the new eu member .
meanwhile , the european union has urged moldova to resume normal relations with romania .
in a statement by the foreign ministers of france , the czech republic and sweden , the 27-member bloc said it remains ready to work with moldova in accordance with european values and principles .

the announcement by the cia is latest reversal of terrorism policy by the new us administration .

" i have directed our agency personnel to take charge of the decommissioning process and have further directed that the contracts for site security be promptly terminated , " he said .

"
in 2006 , bush first acknowledged the existence of the secret prisons , which were used to hold high-profile suspects including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the prisons ' existence caused problems for some governments in europe and asia who allegedly were aware of the facilities .
a european union report in 2007 singled out poland and romania for allowing cia prisons on their soil from between 2002 and 2005 , although both denied any knowledge .
red cross accuses cia of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the policies of the bush administration have been widely condemned the harsh methods employed under the bush administration , including simulated drowning or " waterboarding " of detainees , were widely condemned as torture and abuse .
an internal report leaked last month from the international committee of the red cross said the cia 's interrogations amounted to torture . the report concluded that the treatment of inmates at black sites run by the cia amounted to " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " prohibited by the geneva conventions .
the conclusions by icrc officials came after they were granted exclusive access to the cia 's " high-value " detainees who had been transferred in 2006 to the guantanamo bay prison . nda / wl / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

with every polar bear birth – from flocke to wilbaer – the possible psychological effects of the relentless merchandising campaigns and the highly lucrative " aah " factor went unaddressed .
amid all the hype and hysteria , no-one spoke up to remind the enraptured public that these animals were supreme predators who , given time , would be more inclined to bite than to lick the hands that fed .
eradicating the boundaries of common sense - which kept polar bears firmly in the part of the brain marked ' potential killers ' away from the part inhabited by steiff toys and kittens - may be to blame for the behavior of a german woman who leapt into the polar bear enclosure at berlin zoo on friday .
police say the 32-year-old woman jumped into the enclosure and was bitten several times on her arms and legs by one of the four older polar bears in the enclosure and not by the famous knut .
heiner kloes , a zoo spokesman , told the dpa press agency that keepers pushed the bear away and pulled the woman out from the enclosure , which is surrounded by a fence , a line of prickly hedges and a wall , a comprehensive sign that getting in with the bears was not encouraged and one which suggests that the woman was very determined .
the woman was taken to a hospital for treatment .
her condition was not immediately known .
police did not say why she jumped in with the bear .
the bear responsible for the attack will not face any consequences .
" the woman has proved herself to be careless by jumping into the enclosure , " a police spokesperson told the associated press .
" logic tells us that polar bears will do this type of thing in this situation . " nda / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

'
georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .

'
georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .
but georgia 's opposition is divided , lacking a true leader or a political agenda beyond kicking saakashvili out of office . nda / wl / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eradicating the boundaries of common sense - which kept polar bears firmly in the part of the brain marked ' potential killers ' away from the part inhabited by steiff toys and kittens - may be to blame for the behavior of a german woman who leapt into the polar bear enclosure at berlin zoo on friday .
police say the 32-year-old woman jumped into the enclosure and was bitten several times on her arms and legs by one of the four older polar bears in the enclosure and not by the famous knut .
heiner kloes , a zoo spokesman , told the dpa press agency that keepers pushed the bear away and pulled the woman out from the enclosure , which is surrounded by a fence , a line of prickly hedges and a wall , a comprehensive sign that getting in with the bears was not encouraged and one which suggests that the woman was very determined .
the woman was taken to a hospital for treatment .
her condition was not immediately known .
police did not say why she jumped in with the bear .
the bear responsible for the attack will not face any consequences .
" the woman has proved herself to be careless by jumping into the enclosure , " a police spokesperson told the associated press .
" logic tells us that polar bears will do this type of thing in this situation . " nda / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .

with every polar bear birth – from flocke to wilbaer – the possible psychological effects of the relentless merchandising campaigns and the highly lucrative " aah " factor went unaddressed .
amid all the hype and hysteria , no-one spoke up to remind the enraptured public that these animals were supreme predators who , given time , would be more inclined to bite than to lick the hands that fed .
eradicating the boundaries of common sense - which kept polar bears firmly in the part of the brain marked ' potential killers ' away from the part inhabited by steiff toys and kittens - may be to blame for the behavior of a german woman who leapt into the polar bear enclosure at berlin zoo on friday .
police say the 32-year-old woman jumped into the enclosure and was bitten several times on her arms and legs by one of the four older polar bears in the enclosure and not by the famous knut .
heiner kloes , a zoo spokesman , told the dpa press agency that keepers pushed the bear away and pulled the woman out from the enclosure , which is surrounded by a fence , a line of prickly hedges and a wall , a comprehensive sign that getting in with the bears was not encouraged and one which suggests that the woman was very determined .
the woman was taken to a hospital for treatment .
her condition was not immediately known .
police did not say why she jumped in with the bear .
the bear responsible for the attack will not face any consequences .
" the woman has proved herself to be careless by jumping into the enclosure , " a police spokesperson told the associated press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.04.2009 us considers adopting german-style car-scrapping subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investing five billion euros in car wrecking subsidies as us lawmakers discuss the creation of their own system of auto trade-in subsidies , critics of the scheme here in germany are questioning the motivations of decision-makers in berlin . for many germans the government 's car scrapping incentive program is a dream come true .
they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 10.04.2009 germany to consider gun fingerprint scanners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic keys with fingerprint scanners are already on the market - for about 260 euros the german government is exploring introducing strict new measures on deadly weapons , such as biometric identification methods and better safety locks on guns . sparked by the deadly shooting in the southern german town of winnenden in march , the country 's interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , says berlin is working on ways of imposing tougher restrictions on gun access .
schaueble told the daily rheinische post newspaper that fingerprint scanners installed on gun case locks is one possibility , while better safety locks on the firearms themselves would be also be considered .
“ there are interesting technical possibilities , ” he said .
his comments follow the case in march , when a 17-year-old youth shot dead 15 people and himself , using his father 's pistol .
he had apparently obtained the security code to his father 's gun chest .
experts doubt effectivness but some weapon experts doubt the effectiveness of the biometric system for weapons .
david schiller , editor of the arms magazine , visier , says items like the “ smart gun ” - which can only be operated by the owner - sound good but are not the solution .
he says fingerprint-scanning devices could be duped , while strong magnetic forces could destroy the electronic capabilities of locks .
schiller favors improved education and less violence in the media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and his state colleagues will consider changes at their conference in june lapses in gun law enforcement germany experienced another deadly shooting this week , when a 60-year-old man shot dead his sister-in-law and wounded two people before turning the gun on himself , outside a court near munich .
the two incidents have attracted a lot of attention from both the media and berlin .
germany 's gun laws were significantly tightened following the erfurt school massacre in 2002 , when a gunman killed 16 people and himself .
interior minister schaeuble said while germany has one of the world 's toughest arms-control laws , the latest cases show there have been lapses in its implementation and enforcement .
he has begun talks with officials from germany 's 16 states as well as gun clubs and hunting groups about better firearm security .
recommendations from the talks are expected to handed down at a conference of state interior ministers in early june , where changes to gun laws are on the agenda . cg / ca , dpae / rheinische post / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

the announcement by the cia is latest reversal of terrorism policy by the new us administration . " the cia no longer operates detention facilities or black sites and has proposed a plan to decommission the remaining sites , " cia director leon panetta said in a letter to staff that was released on the cia 's website .
" i have directed our agency personnel to take charge of the decommissioning process and have further directed that the contracts for site security be promptly terminated , " he said .
panetta said the cia still reserved the right to hold suspects for a brief period before handing them over to military authorities .
the cia statement is said to confirm that the spy service was carrying out an order from president barack obama to shut down the secret detention centres .
human-rights groups have condemned the treatment of al-qaeda terrorist suspects in secret cia prisons in foreign countries .
rights groups and media reports have alleged the secret prisons were located in central and eastern europe , including poland , romania and in former yugoslavia , as well as in the horn of africa and on us navy ships .
obama pledges to reverse bush 's policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama , with cia chief leon panetta -lrb- r . -rrb- , says the us " does not torture " obama has already ordered the eventual closure of the controversial prison camp in guantanamo bay , cuba , and repealed some of the harsh interrogation tactics used under president george w bush while repeating his mantra that the united states " does not torture . "
in 2006 , bush first acknowledged the existence of the secret prisons , which were used to hold high-profile suspects including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the prisons ' existence caused problems for some governments in europe and asia who allegedly were aware of the facilities .
a european union report in 2007 singled out poland and romania for allowing cia prisons on their soil from between 2002 and 2005 , although both denied any knowledge .
red cross accuses cia of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the policies of the bush administration have been widely condemned the harsh methods employed under the bush administration , including simulated drowning or " waterboarding " of detainees , were widely condemned as torture and abuse .
an internal report leaked last month from the international committee of the red cross said the cia 's interrogations amounted to torture . the report concluded that the treatment of inmates at black sites run by the cia amounted to " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " prohibited by the geneva conventions .

'
georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .

georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .

the announcement by the cia is latest reversal of terrorism policy by the new us administration . " the cia no longer operates detention facilities or black sites and has proposed a plan to decommission the remaining sites , " cia director leon panetta said in a letter to staff that was released on the cia 's website .
" i have directed our agency personnel to take charge of the decommissioning process and have further directed that the contracts for site security be promptly terminated , " he said .
panetta said the cia still reserved the right to hold suspects for a brief period before handing them over to military authorities .
the cia statement is said to confirm that the spy service was carrying out an order from president barack obama to shut down the secret detention centres .
human-rights groups have condemned the treatment of al-qaeda terrorist suspects in secret cia prisons in foreign countries .
rights groups and media reports have alleged the secret prisons were located in central and eastern europe , including poland , romania and in former yugoslavia , as well as in the horn of africa and on us navy ships .

"
in 2006 , bush first acknowledged the existence of the secret prisons , which were used to hold high-profile suspects including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the attacks on sept .

the prisons ' existence caused problems for some governments in europe and asia who allegedly were aware of the facilities .
a european union report in 2007 singled out poland and romania for allowing cia prisons on their soil from between 2002 and 2005 , although both denied any knowledge .
red cross accuses cia of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the policies of the bush administration have been widely condemned the harsh methods employed under the bush administration , including simulated drowning or " waterboarding " of detainees , were widely condemned as torture and abuse .
an internal report leaked last month from the international committee of the red cross said the cia 's interrogations amounted to torture . the report concluded that the treatment of inmates at black sites run by the cia amounted to " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " prohibited by the geneva conventions .
the conclusions by icrc officials came after they were granted exclusive access to the cia 's " high-value " detainees who had been transferred in 2006 to the guantanamo bay prison . nda / wl / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rights groups and media reports have alleged the secret prisons were located in central and eastern europe , including poland , romania and in former yugoslavia , as well as in the horn of africa and on us navy ships .
obama pledges to reverse bush 's policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama , with cia chief leon panetta -lrb- r . -rrb- , says the us " does not torture " obama has already ordered the eventual closure of the controversial prison camp in guantanamo bay , cuba , and repealed some of the harsh interrogation tactics used under president george w bush while repeating his mantra that the united states " does not torture . "
in 2006 , bush first acknowledged the existence of the secret prisons , which were used to hold high-profile suspects including khalid sheikh mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the prisons ' existence caused problems for some governments in europe and asia who allegedly were aware of the facilities .
a european union report in 2007 singled out poland and romania for allowing cia prisons on their soil from between 2002 and 2005 , although both denied any knowledge .
red cross accuses cia of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the policies of the bush administration have been widely condemned the harsh methods employed under the bush administration , including simulated drowning or " waterboarding " of detainees , were widely condemned as torture and abuse .
an internal report leaked last month from the international committee of the red cross said the cia 's interrogations amounted to torture . the report concluded that the treatment of inmates at black sites run by the cia amounted to " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " prohibited by the geneva conventions .
the conclusions by icrc officials came after they were granted exclusive access to the cia 's " high-value " detainees who had been transferred in 2006 to the guantanamo bay prison . nda / wl / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.04.2009 moldovan president agrees to election recount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders say the election was fraudulent moldovan president vladimir voronin has called for a full recount of sunday 's parliamentary election , which was marred by claims of voter fraud .
he claims it will help restore stability to his country . bowing to a key demand of protesters who say the ruling communist party rigged results , voronin said in an official statement : " i am convinced that a complete recount of votes will become a major argument for maintaining political stability , peace and mutual trust in moldova " .
violent opposition protests - with crowds of students in the former soviet republic denouncing alleged election fraud - smashed their way into the parliament and set it ablaze on tuesday .
the authorities responded with a crackdown and mass arrests .
the riots left more than 90 people injured and led to 200 arrests .
moldova 's central electoral commission had announced the communist party lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections , winning just under 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member parliament .
that was revised down from an initial count of 61 seats .
this means the communists do n't have enough seats in parliament to appoint the president , but they still won the election .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
more student protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist students have voiced their opinions in street protests some 200 anti-communist protestors gathered for a rally in the moldovan capital , chisinau , on friday , calling for the resignation of the communist government .
standing in front of the government building , with many holding romanian flags , the protesters chanted slogans such as " down with the communists " and " resignation . "
it was unclear whether they were aware of president voronin 's call for an election recount .
prime minister zinaida greceanii has urged students to stay away from the rally .
european union urges normal relations with romania president voronin had blamed moldova 's neighbour romania for stirring up the riots and ordered the expulsion of the romanian ambassador - sparking an unprecedented diplomatic row with the new eu member .
meanwhile , the european union has urged moldova to resume normal relations with romania .
in a statement by the foreign ministers of france , the czech republic and sweden , the 27-member bloc said it remains ready to work with moldova in accordance with european values and principles .
it stressed the need to maintain good ties with all its neighbors and urged that country to respect all constitutional freedoms .
russia 's slams moldovan protests moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
political analysts says the violent protests have triggered memories of street rallies in ex-soviet republics ukraine and georgia that toppled pro-moscow regimes , and raised fears that young russian crowds might one day slip out of the kremlin 's control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's lavrov is keeping an eye on developments " the moscow authorities are afraid of spontaneous mass protests in the regions ... and for this reason russian television is showing what is happening in an exclusively negative light , " dmitry oreshkin , a moscow-based political analyst told reuters .
foreign minister sergei lavrov described the young moldovan protesters who ransacked buildings as " pogrom-makers " set on destroying the country .
he 's also warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow . cg , jen afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he claims it will help restore stability to his country . bowing to a key demand of protesters who say the ruling communist party rigged results , voronin said in an official statement : " i am convinced that a complete recount of votes will become a major argument for maintaining political stability , peace and mutual trust in moldova " .
violent opposition protests - with crowds of students in the former soviet republic denouncing alleged election fraud - smashed their way into the parliament and set it ablaze on tuesday .
the authorities responded with a crackdown and mass arrests .
the riots left more than 90 people injured and led to 200 arrests .
moldova 's central electoral commission had announced the communist party lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections , winning just under 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member parliament .
that was revised down from an initial count of 61 seats .
this means the communists do n't have enough seats in parliament to appoint the president , but they still won the election .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .

in a statement by the foreign ministers of france , the czech republic and sweden , the 27-member bloc said it remains ready to work with moldova in accordance with european values and principles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.04.2009 us considers adopting german-style car-scrapping subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investing five billion euros in car wrecking subsidies as us lawmakers discuss the creation of their own system of auto trade-in subsidies , critics of the scheme here in germany are questioning the motivations of decision-makers in berlin . for many germans the government 's car scrapping incentive program is a dream come true .
they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .

they simply drop their old rust-bucket off at the junkyard and receive 2,500 euros from the state to help buy a shiny , new car .
with more than a million applications received so far , the german government extended the scheme this week and boosted its funding from 1.5 to five billion euros .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says the unexpected popularity of the trade-in program is good news for the nation ’ s ailing economy .
" our efforts to strengthen the automobile industry have been so successful that other eu member states have become envious of the scheme , " tiefensee said .
a total of 11 european countries have introduced car-scrapping programs to stimulate demand and help counter the recession , according to the european automobile manufacturer 's association .
now leaders in united states appear to have warmed to the idea of launching their own scheme as well , reviving plans shot down by congress earlier this year .
cash for clunkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama appears keen to follow chancellor angela merkel 's lead us lawmakers are examining two proposals for their own ' cash for clunkers ' scheme .
the first , put forward by a democrat representative , would pay consumers up to $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- if they trade in models from 2001 or earlier and buy a new vehicle assembled in the us , canada or mexico .
while that might be good for the us car industry , critics say it would harm international trade and do little to help cut the nation ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . the second proposal , drafted by a team of democrat and republican senators , would involve payments of $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 linked to tight efficiency controls .
the plan would not discriminate against foreign car manufacturers , and is therefore likely to face tough opposition from union leaders .
as lawmakers debate the pros and cons , us president barack obama has stressed that he wants to achieve the same goals german chancellor angela merkel listed when she introduced her subsidy program ; to support the domestic car industry , secure jobs , and protect the environment .
but just how effective has the german experience really been ?
green grievances while most germans refer to the trade-in subsidy scheme as a ' wrecking bonus , ' the federal government prefers to call it the ' environmental premium ' program .
but critics are n't convinced that the scheme is as green as berlin would have voters believe .
" the wrecking subsidy scheme offers no real ecological benefits because it does n't dictate what kind of new car the recipient should buy , " gerd lottsiepen , a spokesman fromgermany 's vcd traffic association , told deutsche welle .
" it could have fuel consumption of three , five or 10 liters per 100 kilometers , and it would n't make a difference .
you get the money as long as you buy a new car and scrap one that 's at least nine years old . "
the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment says the german scheme is flawed because it does nothing to stop a motorist from scrapping a tiny volkswagen lupo -lrb- with fuel consumption of three liters per 100km -rrb- and using the government bonus to buy a gas-guzzling porsche cayenne turbo suv -lrb- 14.7 liters per 100 km -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say the construction of so many new cars is damaging the environment " it is being dressed up as an environmental measure , despite evidence that it can do more harm than good , " the federation wrote in its monthly bulletin .
it quoted an oecd study from 10 years ago that said such schemes " have a high average cost per ton of pollution avoided " and " do not compare favorably with other alternative policy tools on purely environmental grounds " .
the vcd says although most germans making use of the wrecking subsidies are choosing smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , they may still be doing more harm than good .
lottsiepen says that considering that the production process accounts for about half the damage a car inflicts on the environment over its entire lifespan , a policy that encourages certain older cars to stay on the road longer would inflict less environmental damage than the current scheme .
windfall effect while the trade-in subsidy has proven a hit with german motorists , boosting car sales by 40 percent in march , economic experts say the long term effects of the program are questionable .
professor willi diez , director of germany 's renowned ifa institute for automotive economics , told deutsche welle he predicts demand for new cars will fall dramatically once funding for the bonus payments dries up .
" schemes like these always create a so-called windfall effect .
that is , half of the cars sold under the premium scheme this year are cars that wo n't be sold next year , " diez says .
" the government is , of course , hoping that other economic sectors will have recovered by then , and can compensate for this effect . "
the wrecking premium is just one component of the german government 's broader economic stimulus package , which aims to boost consumption and protect jobs in the face of the global economic downturn .
but many critics argue that the car subsidies do little to help struggling german carmakers because most consumers are using the taxpayer-funded bonus to buy small cars made by foreign manufacturers .
foreign beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus scheme has done little to boost sales at the high end of the german auto market according to a federal motor vehicle office report from early april , german sales at daimler 's mercedes-benz brand plunged 7.6 percent last month and fell 1.1 percent at bmw .
in contrast , registrations tripled for cheaper vehicles made by japan 's suzuki and italy 's fiat , and doubled for cars made by south korean manufacturers kia and hyundai .
while volkswagen did manage to lift domestic sales by 36 percent in march , it lost market share to french rival peugeot citroen , which enjoyed a 63 percent gain , and japanese auto giant toyota , whose sales surged by 55 percent .
meanwhile , general motors ' troubled german unit , opel , saw sales jump 27 percent , mainly due to increased demand for its corsa compact .
german critics of the scrapping incentive say that while bonus payments may be a boon to customers and some dealers , they 're hurting other parts of the wider industry , such as used-car showrooms , parts suppliers and workshops that service older models .
" economic nonsense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz says the expansion of the subsidy program is politically motivated some of the harshest criticism of berlin 's decision to prolong the bonus program has come from the chairman of merkel 's council of independent economic advisors , wolfgang franz , who says the program is aimed primarily aimed at winning votes in september 's national election .
" every decent economist would agree that this decision is economic nonsense , " franz told a bloomberg reporter in an interview published on friday .
franz , a professor at the zew center for european economic research , said berlin was guided by a " perception that voters would be angry when the money is gone " and was therefore " too afraid to bury a project as popular as the scrapping program " .

'
georgia 's opposition said it would launch more protests and block streets in the capital tblisi , after president mikheil saakashvili ignored calls to resign . " because saakashvili has not decided to resign , the opposition has decided to start a national disobedience campaign , " kakha kukava , a co-leader of the opposition conservative party , told about 25,000 protesters outside parliament .
" as of 6 p.m. this friday the protesters will block main streets throughout tbilisi , " kukava said .
opposition leader david gamkrelidze warned of possible violence were saakashvili to continue to dismiss the protests .
" if the government keeps ignoring the demonstrations , this could lead to a people 's revolution , " he said in an interview on the maestro television channel .
the marches will go on until saakashvili quits , opposition officials said .
saakashvili has refused to step down despite tens of thousands of protestors nationwide demanding he leave his job .
the president has instead offered to talk with the opposition to resolve the growing crisis .
" the government is ready for a dialogue with all political powers , moderate or radical , " saakashvili said in a national television address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 to 150,000 people marched in tblisi georgia 's opposition launched mass demonstrations against saakashvili on thursday .
it accuses the president of leading the caucasus nation into a disastrous war against russia in august , and of using police and national security forces to repress domestic dissent .
saakashvili has from time to time offered to discuss georgia 's difficult economic and political situation with his critics , but so far the opposition has rejected the offers as insincere .
president accused of undermining georgia saakashvili 's fall in popularity , still high less than one year ago , accelerated after last year 's war with russia led to the total loss of the georgian provinces south ossetia and abkhazia .
both states subsequently declared independence .
moscow has recognized south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , and maintains combat troops in both locations .
" saakashvili has undermined the reputation of georgia , and he has divided our land , " said levan gachechiladze , a former presidential candidate .
now an opposition leader , gachechiladze estimated the size of the anti-saakashvili crowd in tbilisi at 150,000 participants .
independent observers put the size of the demonstration at some 80,000 .
tens of thousands of anti-saakashvili protestors took to the streets in batumi , poti , and other georgian cities , according to georgian news reports .
" misha , get out ! " chanted the crowd at some locations .
saakashvili takes protests in stride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has appeared untroubled by the protests saakashvili 's public reaction to the demonstrations thus far has been mild , with the georgian leader telling reporters he viewed the marches as proof of the country 's support freedom of speech and expression .
the saakashvili administration in november 2007 unleashed police on similar anti-government demonstrations , citing the marches ' alleged threat to public order , and violation of public disturbance law .
some saakashvili critics argued the 2007 police assault on generally peaceful protestors recalled a soviet repression of a georgian nationalist demonstration in april 1989 killing 20 marchers .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after mass demonstrations in tbilisi forced then-president eduard shevardnadze from office .
georgia 's opposition in recent months has attempted to pressure saakashvili into quitting his post , arguing the august war against russia , and a worsening economy have made his presidency ineffective .
but georgia 's opposition is divided , lacking a true leader or a political agenda beyond kicking saakashvili out of office . nda / wl / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he claims it will help restore stability to his country . bowing to a key demand of protesters who say the ruling communist party rigged results , voronin said in an official statement : " i am convinced that a complete recount of votes will become a major argument for maintaining political stability , peace and mutual trust in moldova " .
violent opposition protests - with crowds of students in the former soviet republic denouncing alleged election fraud - smashed their way into the parliament and set it ablaze on tuesday .
the authorities responded with a crackdown and mass arrests .
the riots left more than 90 people injured and led to 200 arrests .
moldova 's central electoral commission had announced the communist party lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections , winning just under 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member parliament .
that was revised down from an initial count of 61 seats .
this means the communists do n't have enough seats in parliament to appoint the president , but they still won the election .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
more student protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist students have voiced their opinions in street protests some 200 anti-communist protestors gathered for a rally in the moldovan capital , chisinau , on friday , calling for the resignation of the communist government .
standing in front of the government building , with many holding romanian flags , the protesters chanted slogans such as " down with the communists " and " resignation . "
it was unclear whether they were aware of president voronin 's call for an election recount .
prime minister zinaida greceanii has urged students to stay away from the rally .
european union urges normal relations with romania president voronin had blamed moldova 's neighbour romania for stirring up the riots and ordered the expulsion of the romanian ambassador - sparking an unprecedented diplomatic row with the new eu member .
meanwhile , the european union has urged moldova to resume normal relations with romania .
in a statement by the foreign ministers of france , the czech republic and sweden , the 27-member bloc said it remains ready to work with moldova in accordance with european values and principles .
it stressed the need to maintain good ties with all its neighbors and urged that country to respect all constitutional freedoms .
russia 's slams moldovan protests moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
political analysts says the violent protests have triggered memories of street rallies in ex-soviet republics ukraine and georgia that toppled pro-moscow regimes , and raised fears that young russian crowds might one day slip out of the kremlin 's control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's lavrov is keeping an eye on developments " the moscow authorities are afraid of spontaneous mass protests in the regions ... and for this reason russian television is showing what is happening in an exclusively negative light , " dmitry oreshkin , a moscow-based political analyst told reuters .

with every polar bear birth – from flocke to wilbaer – the possible psychological effects of the relentless merchandising campaigns and the highly lucrative " aah " factor went unaddressed .
amid all the hype and hysteria , no-one spoke up to remind the enraptured public that these animals were supreme predators who , given time , would be more inclined to bite than to lick the hands that fed .
eradicating the boundaries of common sense - which kept polar bears firmly in the part of the brain marked ' potential killers ' away from the part inhabited by steiff toys and kittens - may be to blame for the behavior of a german woman who leapt into the polar bear enclosure at berlin zoo on friday .
police say the 32-year-old woman jumped into the enclosure and was bitten several times on her arms and legs by one of the four older polar bears in the enclosure and not by the famous knut .
heiner kloes , a zoo spokesman , told the dpa press agency that keepers pushed the bear away and pulled the woman out from the enclosure , which is surrounded by a fence , a line of prickly hedges and a wall , a comprehensive sign that getting in with the bears was not encouraged and one which suggests that the woman was very determined .
the woman was taken to a hospital for treatment .
her condition was not immediately known .
police did not say why she jumped in with the bear .
the bear responsible for the attack will not face any consequences .
" the woman has proved herself to be careless by jumping into the enclosure , " a police spokesperson told the associated press .

the deadly huanglongbing -lrb- hlb -rrb- virus is transmitted by a small fly called a psyllid that thrives on the leaves of the orange trees .
the blight has already caused extensive damage to orange crops in thailand .
oranges are the main cash crop in all but four districts of bhutan and one the country 's most important exports .
last year , exports climbed to a new high , as bhutan exported 17,208,084 tonnes of oranges to bangladesh and 1,395,207 tonnes to india .
orchard owners say they have been receiving record prices for their crop , up to $ 18 -lrb- £ 12 -rrb- per box .
" that is why we are so distressed this year , " said pem dorji , who owns an orchard in chukha , where one of bhutan 's biggest hydro-electric power projects is located .
" we will lose all our income , we will become beggars . "
' devastating ' the psyllid passes on the hlb virus , also known as citrus greening , as it sucks on new leaves of the orange trees .
scientists say the virus infection is so severe that it ultimately kills the whole tree .
it has already wiped out 70 % of orange orchards in punakha , while other orange growing regions like wangduephodrang , mongar , zhemgang and sarpang are also severely hit .
in chukha , the entire orange growing region of baikuenza has been wiped out .
in a circular , the bhutanese agriculture ministry said the virus could " devastate the whole citrus industry in the country if appropriate measures are not taken soon " .
dr sangay duba , of the national plant protection centre , has been quoted by bhutan 's kuensel newspaper as saying that orchards which used to produce 200 to 300 trucks of oranges every year have barely produced 10 to 15 this year .
" the situation could get worse , " he warned .
scientists say that since most orchard owners in bhutan are absentee landlords they have paid little attention to plantation management and pest control .
there are 57,000 acres of abandoned or illegal orchards in the country , from where the deadly virus is said to have spread across the orange growing belt of bhutan .
concerned at the damage to one of its once most thriving export industries , bhutan 's government has issued an ordinance leading to the creation of an investigation team to control orchard pests .
this team has been given the right of entry into any orange orchard and can fine farmers between 5,000 to 50,000 ngultrums -lrb- $ 100- $ 1,000 : £ 68- £ 680 -rrb- if they do not implement recommendations about pest control .
the ministry of agriculture has also proposed that illegal orchards whose owners are not traceable should be handed over to landless farmers to be better managed .
bhutan 's national plant protection centre has also developed an " action plan " that involves training and capacity development , quarantine of plants , insect proof nursery and re-plantation in virus-hit areas .
