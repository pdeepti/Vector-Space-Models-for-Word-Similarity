the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .
" they have n't dramatized the situation , " an unnamed civil servant was quoted as saying .
" instead , it seems they wanted impress us with a very realistic assessment . " sje / dpa / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

the popular priest was murdered by the secret police . father jerzy popieluszko has been posthumously awarded poland 's highest distinction - the order of the white eagle - by president lech kaczynski , twenty-five years after his brutal murder .
the priest is considered a symbol of the church 's resistance against the communist regime , and his grave in warsaw is the most popular pilgrimage site in poland after czestochowa , the sacred mountain of the black madonna .
born in 1947 in northern poland , the charismatic young priest championed poland 's banned solidarity trade union , and denounced communism in passionate sermons from the pulpit of st. stanislaus kostka church in warsaw .
at the age of just thirty-seven , on october 19 , 1984 , popieluszko was kidnapped and assassinated by the country 's secret police .
his body was n't discovered until nearly two weeks later in a reservoir west of warsaw .
around 250,000 mourners attended popieluszko 's funeral .
four people were charged and served jail time for the crime , but have since been released .
photos of father jerzy popieluszko were splashed across polish newspapers on monday as the country remembered him . speaking to polish radio , the warsaw archbishop kazimierz nycz called the death of father popieluszko one of the saddest days in the history of the church. vj / epd / kna / ap editor : michael lawton charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?

politicians , certain government employees and members of the german military are scheduled to receive one type of the swine flu vaccine , while average citizens in germany are to receive a different one .
the difference between the two vaccines is that the one meant for members of the government is said to have fewer side-effects .
it also lacks certain additives which are said to be present in the version for the general population .
a spokesperson for the german interior minister , quoted by the berliner zeitung newspaper , said that the vaccines marked for the government were ordered months ago , when there were no clear differences between the two vaccines .

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "

biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair opinion -pipe- 19.10.2009 opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody is talking about china .
but this year 's guest country was n't the only topic of discussion at the frankfurt book fair .
industry insiders had other worries as well , says dw 's gabriela schaaf . " everybody comes to frankfurt , because everybody comes to frankfurt " - that 's how publishing industry insiders describe the frankfurt book fair 's recipe for success .
it has a certain magnetic effect .
though the rights and licensing for books can be dealt with at any time of the year , it is only at the fair that industry representatives have the opportunity to sit face-to-face .
this is important for a business built on trust . but this year , not everyone came : several east european publishers stayed home due to a lack of state funding , and america 's biggest publishing houses sent far fewer people than in other years .
welcome to the frankfurt book fair in the year of the global financial crisis . fair organizers maintained that the industry , overall , is still doing quite well .
the lower turn-out does not represent a threat to the industry ; it was just a temporary phenomenon , they said . and the book market in germany is doing quite well by comparison - there was talk of a 2.8 percent growth in sales compared to last year .
nevertheless , things are changing - not least , the book itself . rarely has there been so much talk about digital media as in this year .
even though the e-book has n't become a best-seller yet , producers are already preparing for the big breakthrough .
germany is on the right track : the majority of publishers here keep their books in digital as well as paper form .
a branch-wide online portal is already up and running .
after all , nothing would be more fatal to the industry than to let all of the profit be swallowed up by google and co . there was also a lot of buzz in the run-up to the fair about the appearance of this year 's controversial guest country , china .
in the end , the official chinese organization committee struck a positive balance : their authors were welcomed and appeared satisfied with their closed-door agreement .
however , they repeated over and over again , like a mantra , that there was no censorship in china -lrb- but that authors may not break the law -rrb- . dialogue between the chinese delegation and the exiled authors and dissidents never took place - at least not in public .
more could and should have been done on this front if there had really been a desire .
the venue for the fair , which included two separate halls , spread widely apart , did n't exactly encourage discussion . the german media , however , engaged in a lively debate on the subject , which was one positive outcome of the book fair .
never before have we heard so much about china - its problems , objections , and taboo topics . argentina will be the guest country in 2010 , and that will surely be less touchy than this year .
as the largest book producer in latin america , it hopes to present its varied history and cultural diversity .
argentina hosts the most important book fair in latin america , and is an important partner of the frankfurt book fair . and then , hopefully , everybody will come again to frankfurt - because everybody comes to frankfurt . author : gabriela schaaf is dw 's literature expert -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dossier : frankfurt book fair from e-books to paperbacks or biographies to novels - the world 's largest book fair runs through sunday in frankfurt .
with china as the guest of honor , there 's room for literary discoveries , as well as political tension .
-lrb- 16.10.2009 -rrb- frankfurt book fair underway as germans read their way out of the recession not only did germany win the 2009 nobel prize for literature - german language books sales were up 2.8 percent over the last 12 months ! -lrb- 14.10.2009 -rrb- germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair the frankfurt book fair opens after a month of controversy over who is running the show - the german organizers or the chinese delegation , this year 's guest of honor .
but will diplomatic relations be affected ? -lrb- 14.10.2009 -rrb- feedback do you think there should have been more dialogue with china at the book fair ?

speaking to reporters outside the eu farm ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday , eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said that she was emptying her pockets to give the 280 million to eu farmers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month farmers from germany , france and belgium protested the falling prices by spraying milk on fields " that 's all i have .
i do n't have a special account in switzerland or anywhere else , " she added , suggesting the there was little chance that further help would be coming from the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
fischer boel did not give any specific details on what form the aid would take , but she did stress that it would be the european union , and not eu countries , that would make the final decision .
the money is to come out of next year 's eu budget .
last november , eu agriculture ministers agreed that they would lift milk production quotas by one percent annually before ultimately scrapping them in 2014 or 2015 .
in recent months , however , tens of thousands of european farmers have held protests demanding support through financial or other means. mrm / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to reporters outside the eu farm ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday , eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said that she was emptying her pockets to give the 280 million to eu farmers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month farmers from germany , france and belgium protested the falling prices by spraying milk on fields " that 's all i have .
i do n't have a special account in switzerland or anywhere else , " she added , suggesting the there was little chance that further help would be coming from the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
fischer boel did not give any specific details on what form the aid would take , but she did stress that it would be the european union , and not eu countries , that would make the final decision .
the money is to come out of next year 's eu budget .
last november , eu agriculture ministers agreed that they would lift milk production quotas by one percent annually before ultimately scrapping them in 2014 or 2015 .
in recent months , however , tens of thousands of european farmers have held protests demanding support through financial or other means. mrm / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair opinion -pipe- 19.10.2009 opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody is talking about china .
but this year 's guest country was n't the only topic of discussion at the frankfurt book fair .
industry insiders had other worries as well , says dw 's gabriela schaaf . " everybody comes to frankfurt , because everybody comes to frankfurt " - that 's how publishing industry insiders describe the frankfurt book fair 's recipe for success .
it has a certain magnetic effect .
though the rights and licensing for books can be dealt with at any time of the year , it is only at the fair that industry representatives have the opportunity to sit face-to-face .
this is important for a business built on trust . but this year , not everyone came : several east european publishers stayed home due to a lack of state funding , and america 's biggest publishing houses sent far fewer people than in other years .
welcome to the frankfurt book fair in the year of the global financial crisis . fair organizers maintained that the industry , overall , is still doing quite well .
the lower turn-out does not represent a threat to the industry ; it was just a temporary phenomenon , they said . and the book market in germany is doing quite well by comparison - there was talk of a 2.8 percent growth in sales compared to last year .
nevertheless , things are changing - not least , the book itself . rarely has there been so much talk about digital media as in this year .
even though the e-book has n't become a best-seller yet , producers are already preparing for the big breakthrough .
germany is on the right track : the majority of publishers here keep their books in digital as well as paper form .
a branch-wide online portal is already up and running .
after all , nothing would be more fatal to the industry than to let all of the profit be swallowed up by google and co . there was also a lot of buzz in the run-up to the fair about the appearance of this year 's controversial guest country , china .
in the end , the official chinese organization committee struck a positive balance : their authors were welcomed and appeared satisfied with their closed-door agreement .
however , they repeated over and over again , like a mantra , that there was no censorship in china -lrb- but that authors may not break the law -rrb- . dialogue between the chinese delegation and the exiled authors and dissidents never took place - at least not in public .
more could and should have been done on this front if there had really been a desire .
the venue for the fair , which included two separate halls , spread widely apart , did n't exactly encourage discussion . the german media , however , engaged in a lively debate on the subject , which was one positive outcome of the book fair .
never before have we heard so much about china - its problems , objections , and taboo topics . argentina will be the guest country in 2010 , and that will surely be less touchy than this year .
as the largest book producer in latin america , it hopes to present its varied history and cultural diversity .
argentina hosts the most important book fair in latin america , and is an important partner of the frankfurt book fair . and then , hopefully , everybody will come again to frankfurt - because everybody comes to frankfurt . author : gabriela schaaf is dw 's literature expert -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dossier : frankfurt book fair from e-books to paperbacks or biographies to novels - the world 's largest book fair runs through sunday in frankfurt .
with china as the guest of honor , there 's room for literary discoveries , as well as political tension .
-lrb- 16.10.2009 -rrb- frankfurt book fair underway as germans read their way out of the recession not only did germany win the 2009 nobel prize for literature - german language books sales were up 2.8 percent over the last 12 months ! -lrb- 14.10.2009 -rrb- germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair the frankfurt book fair opens after a month of controversy over who is running the show - the german organizers or the chinese delegation , this year 's guest of honor .
but will diplomatic relations be affected ? -lrb- 14.10.2009 -rrb- feedback do you think there should have been more dialogue with china at the book fair ?

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .

speaking during the second day of meetings being held by the environment ministers of the 17 nations making up the major economic forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in london , brown said that the time has come to stop pointing fingers and start negotiating a deal to replace the kyoto protocol at the end of the year in copenhagen .
" i believe we can do this .
i believe also that such an agreement not only must but can put the world on a trajectory to a maximum average global temperature increase of two degrees , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is one of the few mef country leaders personally making the trip to copenhagen british economist nicolas stern , who headed the stern review on the economics of climate change , has calculated that global emissions will have to be reduced to 20 gigatons per year by 2050 , down from the current level of 50 gigatons .
on the way to that goal , the world would have to reduce its emissions to 40 gigatons by 2020 and 35 gigatons by 2030 .
brown is one of the few mef leaders planning on attending negotiations in copenhagen this december .
the mef is responsible for an estimated 90 percent of the world 's current emissions .
the october 18-19 meeting is the latest in a us-instigated series of forums meant to build support for the un-backed process .
the london talks focused on how to turn a patchwork of national policies into an international deal , as well as on climate finance and technology cooperation. mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .

central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .
do we go on spending millions and taking heavy losses , while detablilizing an entire region , or do we look for an alternative such as direct engagement ?

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .

but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .
christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat have been holding talks since september 2008 .
but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .
turkey has been urged to open its ports and airports to cyprus , whose government it still does not recognize. bk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german parties wo n't block turkey 's eu bid germany 's new government will not slam the door on turkey 's eu membership bid , according to sources close to the coalition talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 19.10.2009 the eu is ' underperforming ' in the world 's conflict zones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilian missions currently operate in 12 conflict zones for 10 years the eu has proudly been deploying nation-building missions to the world 's worst conflict zones - from afghanistan , to iraq , to darfur .
but a new study says the eu is ' underperforming . ' this year marks the 10th anniversary of the european security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- , which has been deployed in 20 state-building operations across three continents , in the world 's worst conflict zones .
to honor the anniversary , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief , wrote a newspaper commentary recently praising the eu for a decade of promoting peace around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu civilian mission in afghanistan is short-staffed " from kabul to pristina , from ramallah to kinshasa , the eu is monitoring borders , overseeing peace agreements , training police forces , building up criminal justice systems and protecting shipping from pirate attacks , " solana wrote . " thanks to our achievements , we are receiving more and more calls to help in a crisis or after a war .
we have the credibility , the values and the will to do this . "
however , a recent report by the european council on foreign relations argues that eu missions , despite their potential , have so far been " small , lacking in ambition and strategically irrelevant . "
it cites an outdated security strategy , internal squabbles and red tape in brussels , and a failure to live up to personnel commitments as the major areas of esdp underperformance in the world 's trouble spots .
broken promises in 2004 , the eu devised an ambitious set of " civilian headline goals " in order to ensure that each member state committed enough civilian troops .
however , during the last 5 years the eu has only deployed half the number it promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief , javier solana acknowledges that eu civilian missions need to be more efficient the report states that money is not the issue ; the current esdp budget allows for 1,500 more civilian staff members than are currently aiding peace efforts in one of a dozen missions .
in afghanistan , for example , the eu police mission is operating at below half of its budgetary capacity .
" most member states do not take the development of civilian capacity seriously .
there 's a small group of states that do , but the majority of member states simply do n't take it seriously enough , -lsb- and -rsb- do n't invest enough money in it , " the report 's co-author , daniel korski , told deutsche welle .
germany was among those identified by the report as a top performer - along with denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - which have all invested heavily in civilian training and recruitment programs .
other eu members were criticized for not doing enough .
the ' bosnia ' template and red tape in addition , the report claims eu missions tend to deploy the same strategic template in countries as varied as afghanistan , iraq and the democratic republic of the congo - an approach that has " proved ineffectual . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilians helped monitor a peace deal in aceh , indonesia in 2005 it is known as the ' bosnia template ' , and it was first implemented in 2003 .
in that conflict , eu police focused on providing technical assistance to the local police and judiciary while nato took care of security .
but the circumstances on the ground in many failing states today can vary drastically .
" in many of the future theaters of conflict , it 's not going to be easy to find other institutions to provide security whether that be in congo or indeed other parts of asia , " said korski , adding that eu civilian missions will now have to adapt to " operate across a spectrum of tasks . "
brussels-based institutions - namely the european council and european commission - were also earmarked for hampering eu nation-building efforts , due to internal squabbling and a " culture of mismanagment , " though the lisbon treaty reform may improve the way the bloc operates .
eu advantage what to do about failed states may be one of the biggest challenges facing the international community , and the eu is in an advantageous position to contribute to peace efforts abroad , analysts say .
besides having an ample development budget , the eu has an expansive network of some 40,000 diplomats who can provide on the ground intelligence and support .
it also has a positive image in the world , according to the report .
" it is very important to not wait for a country to earn the ignominious label ' failed state ' to conduct civilian support operations , " geopolitical expert and author of " the second world , " parag khanna told deutsche welle .

as discussions enter their final full week , they appear to have made progress on one big item - tax cuts .
according to public broadcaster ard , the two sides have agreed to tax cuts of 20 to 23 billion euros -lrb- $ 30-34 billion -rrb- .
this is significantly less than the 35 billion the fdp had promised during its election campaign , and much closer to the 20 billion in tax cuts that the cdu was looking for .
however , what has n't been agreed is how to finance those tax cuts and both cdu and fdp officials have said they wo n't be making any announcement until mid-week at the earliest .
according to georg fahrenschon , finance minister in the csu government in the southern state of bavaria , the goal now is to use any tax cuts as a means to boost the economy .
the working group charged with hammering out the details of a deal on tax and budgetary policy is meeting again this monday under the direction of merkel 's chief of staff , thomas de maziere .
no news on health fund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three party chiefs , westerwelle -lrb- l -rrb- , merkel -lrb- c -rrb- and seehofer -lrb- r -rrb- , will be rejoining the talks on wednesday while discussion over tax cuts and the nation 's financial future look like they will be wrapping up soon , the two sides do not appear to have made as much headway on another pressing issue : the future of germany 's health care fund .
chief negotiators from both sides – current cdu family minister ursula von der leyen and philipp roesler from the fdp – have indicated the talks have taken a huge step forward .
juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of the north rhine-westphalia , did n't rule out premium increases for health and unemployment insurance .
" of course we are intensively contemplating where we can save money , " ruettgers told ard , " and that includes premiums . "
as negotiations continue , both sides are extremely aware of just how much time pressure they are under .
for almost two weeks they have been holding meetings to hammer out the new center-right coalition .
they have given themselves just a few more days to finalize coalition agreement , and they have n't even gotten to the sensitive topic of cabinet posts yet. mrm / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de negotiations continue between members of germany 's next ruling coalition christian democrats and free democrats are expected to agree on a coalition deal by the end of next week .
some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table .
-lrb- 17.10.2009 -rrb- new german government reaches key internet security agreements as coalition talks in berlin make headway , the junior coalition partner fdp wrests some key concessions from angela merkel 's conservatives .

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

but the type of shot a person gets is to depend on their position in society , leading to complaints about a ' second class ' swine-flu vaccine .
politicians , certain government employees and members of the german military are scheduled to receive one type of the swine flu vaccine , while average citizens in germany are to receive a different one .
the difference between the two vaccines is that the one meant for members of the government is said to have fewer side-effects .
it also lacks certain additives which are said to be present in the version for the general population .
a spokesperson for the german interior minister , quoted by the berliner zeitung newspaper , said that the vaccines marked for the government were ordered months ago , when there were no clear differences between the two vaccines .
she added that the other version was not a second-class vaccine .
according to a separate report in the mass-circulation bild newspaper , chancellor angela merkel and health minister ulla schmidt are planning on getting vaccinated with the shot provided to the general population .

but the type of shot a person gets is to depend on their position in society , leading to complaints about a ' second class ' swine-flu vaccine .
politicians , certain government employees and members of the german military are scheduled to receive one type of the swine flu vaccine , while average citizens in germany are to receive a different one .
the difference between the two vaccines is that the one meant for members of the government is said to have fewer side-effects .
it also lacks certain additives which are said to be present in the version for the general population .
a spokesperson for the german interior minister , quoted by the berliner zeitung newspaper , said that the vaccines marked for the government were ordered months ago , when there were no clear differences between the two vaccines .
she added that the other version was not a second-class vaccine .
according to a separate report in the mass-circulation bild newspaper , chancellor angela merkel and health minister ulla schmidt are planning on getting vaccinated with the shot provided to the general population .
" it 's the same as the rest , " said schmidt , " safe and effective . " mz / reuters / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair opinion -pipe- 19.10.2009 opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody is talking about china .
but this year 's guest country was n't the only topic of discussion at the frankfurt book fair .
industry insiders had other worries as well , says dw 's gabriela schaaf . " everybody comes to frankfurt , because everybody comes to frankfurt " - that 's how publishing industry insiders describe the frankfurt book fair 's recipe for success .
it has a certain magnetic effect .
though the rights and licensing for books can be dealt with at any time of the year , it is only at the fair that industry representatives have the opportunity to sit face-to-face .
this is important for a business built on trust . but this year , not everyone came : several east european publishers stayed home due to a lack of state funding , and america 's biggest publishing houses sent far fewer people than in other years .
welcome to the frankfurt book fair in the year of the global financial crisis . fair organizers maintained that the industry , overall , is still doing quite well .
the lower turn-out does not represent a threat to the industry ; it was just a temporary phenomenon , they said . and the book market in germany is doing quite well by comparison - there was talk of a 2.8 percent growth in sales compared to last year .
nevertheless , things are changing - not least , the book itself . rarely has there been so much talk about digital media as in this year .
even though the e-book has n't become a best-seller yet , producers are already preparing for the big breakthrough .
germany is on the right track : the majority of publishers here keep their books in digital as well as paper form .
a branch-wide online portal is already up and running .
after all , nothing would be more fatal to the industry than to let all of the profit be swallowed up by google and co . there was also a lot of buzz in the run-up to the fair about the appearance of this year 's controversial guest country , china .
in the end , the official chinese organization committee struck a positive balance : their authors were welcomed and appeared satisfied with their closed-door agreement .
however , they repeated over and over again , like a mantra , that there was no censorship in china -lrb- but that authors may not break the law -rrb- . dialogue between the chinese delegation and the exiled authors and dissidents never took place - at least not in public .
more could and should have been done on this front if there had really been a desire .
the venue for the fair , which included two separate halls , spread widely apart , did n't exactly encourage discussion . the german media , however , engaged in a lively debate on the subject , which was one positive outcome of the book fair .
never before have we heard so much about china - its problems , objections , and taboo topics . argentina will be the guest country in 2010 , and that will surely be less touchy than this year .
as the largest book producer in latin america , it hopes to present its varied history and cultural diversity .
argentina hosts the most important book fair in latin america , and is an important partner of the frankfurt book fair . and then , hopefully , everybody will come again to frankfurt - because everybody comes to frankfurt . author : gabriela schaaf is dw 's literature expert -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 19.10.2009 kurdish fighters show support for turkish plans to expand kurdish rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish security waiting for the " peace caravan " a group of 34 kurds has crossed from bases in iraq to turkey in what the kurdish rebel group pkk has called a " peace caravan . "
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .
" they have n't dramatized the situation , " an unnamed civil servant was quoted as saying .

in a vote of confidence early on monday morning , the greek parliament voted along party lines to approve the new government , with all 160 members of papandreou 's socialist party voting for , and 140 members of opposition parties voting against .
papandreou came to power in a snap election earlier this month and now faces some tough challenges as greece tackles its first recession in 16 years .
he must also address the highest debt in the country 's history and a budgetary deficit around 10 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , well over the three percent euro-zone limit .
the incoming prime minster has pledged to fix greece 's economy - which he described as " explosive " - as well as the " state of emergency " in the country 's finances . " we have large hidden debts and spending , an unprecedented lack of competitiveness and social insurance funds in a state of penury , " papandreou told parliament .
renewable energy , increased education spending , and a crack down on tax evasion are also on the new government 's agenda , papandreou said. mz / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as discussions enter their final full week , they appear to have made progress on one big item - tax cuts .
according to public broadcaster ard , the two sides have agreed to tax cuts of 20 to 23 billion euros -lrb- $ 30-34 billion -rrb- .
this is significantly less than the 35 billion the fdp had promised during its election campaign , and much closer to the 20 billion in tax cuts that the cdu was looking for .
however , what has n't been agreed is how to finance those tax cuts and both cdu and fdp officials have said they wo n't be making any announcement until mid-week at the earliest .
according to georg fahrenschon , finance minister in the csu government in the southern state of bavaria , the goal now is to use any tax cuts as a means to boost the economy .

speaking to reporters outside the eu farm ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday , eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said that she was emptying her pockets to give the 280 million to eu farmers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month farmers from germany , france and belgium protested the falling prices by spraying milk on fields " that 's all i have .
i do n't have a special account in switzerland or anywhere else , " she added , suggesting the there was little chance that further help would be coming from the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
fischer boel did not give any specific details on what form the aid would take , but she did stress that it would be the european union , and not eu countries , that would make the final decision .
the money is to come out of next year 's eu budget .
last november , eu agriculture ministers agreed that they would lift milk production quotas by one percent annually before ultimately scrapping them in 2014 or 2015 .
in recent months , however , tens of thousands of european farmers have held protests demanding support through financial or other means. mrm / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 19.10.2009 coaching changes are rarely a cure-all for ailing bundesliga clubs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha gave ex-coach lucien favre his marching orders , but they have n't improved so what do you when your team has slipped down to the nether regions of the table ?
more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .

the popular priest was murdered by the secret police . father jerzy popieluszko has been posthumously awarded poland 's highest distinction - the order of the white eagle - by president lech kaczynski , twenty-five years after his brutal murder .
the priest is considered a symbol of the church 's resistance against the communist regime , and his grave in warsaw is the most popular pilgrimage site in poland after czestochowa , the sacred mountain of the black madonna .
born in 1947 in northern poland , the charismatic young priest championed poland 's banned solidarity trade union , and denounced communism in passionate sermons from the pulpit of st. stanislaus kostka church in warsaw .
at the age of just thirty-seven , on october 19 , 1984 , popieluszko was kidnapped and assassinated by the country 's secret police .
his body was n't discovered until nearly two weeks later in a reservoir west of warsaw .
around 250,000 mourners attended popieluszko 's funeral .
four people were charged and served jail time for the crime , but have since been released .
photos of father jerzy popieluszko were splashed across polish newspapers on monday as the country remembered him . speaking to polish radio , the warsaw archbishop kazimierz nycz called the death of father popieluszko one of the saddest days in the history of the church. vj / epd / kna / ap editor : michael lawton charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .

meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .
christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat have been holding talks since september 2008 .
but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .

but a new study says the eu is ' underperforming . ' this year marks the 10th anniversary of the european security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- , which has been deployed in 20 state-building operations across three continents , in the world 's worst conflict zones .
to honor the anniversary , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief , wrote a newspaper commentary recently praising the eu for a decade of promoting peace around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu civilian mission in afghanistan is short-staffed " from kabul to pristina , from ramallah to kinshasa , the eu is monitoring borders , overseeing peace agreements , training police forces , building up criminal justice systems and protecting shipping from pirate attacks , " solana wrote . " thanks to our achievements , we are receiving more and more calls to help in a crisis or after a war .
we have the credibility , the values and the will to do this . "
however , a recent report by the european council on foreign relations argues that eu missions , despite their potential , have so far been " small , lacking in ambition and strategically irrelevant . "
it cites an outdated security strategy , internal squabbles and red tape in brussels , and a failure to live up to personnel commitments as the major areas of esdp underperformance in the world 's trouble spots .
broken promises in 2004 , the eu devised an ambitious set of " civilian headline goals " in order to ensure that each member state committed enough civilian troops .
however , during the last 5 years the eu has only deployed half the number it promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief , javier solana acknowledges that eu civilian missions need to be more efficient the report states that money is not the issue ; the current esdp budget allows for 1,500 more civilian staff members than are currently aiding peace efforts in one of a dozen missions .
in afghanistan , for example , the eu police mission is operating at below half of its budgetary capacity .
" most member states do not take the development of civilian capacity seriously .
there 's a small group of states that do , but the majority of member states simply do n't take it seriously enough , -lsb- and -rsb- do n't invest enough money in it , " the report 's co-author , daniel korski , told deutsche welle .
germany was among those identified by the report as a top performer - along with denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - which have all invested heavily in civilian training and recruitment programs .
other eu members were criticized for not doing enough .
the ' bosnia ' template and red tape in addition , the report claims eu missions tend to deploy the same strategic template in countries as varied as afghanistan , iraq and the democratic republic of the congo - an approach that has " proved ineffectual . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilians helped monitor a peace deal in aceh , indonesia in 2005 it is known as the ' bosnia template ' , and it was first implemented in 2003 .
in that conflict , eu police focused on providing technical assistance to the local police and judiciary while nato took care of security .
but the circumstances on the ground in many failing states today can vary drastically .
" in many of the future theaters of conflict , it 's not going to be easy to find other institutions to provide security whether that be in congo or indeed other parts of asia , " said korski , adding that eu civilian missions will now have to adapt to " operate across a spectrum of tasks . "
brussels-based institutions - namely the european council and european commission - were also earmarked for hampering eu nation-building efforts , due to internal squabbling and a " culture of mismanagment , " though the lisbon treaty reform may improve the way the bloc operates .
eu advantage what to do about failed states may be one of the biggest challenges facing the international community , and the eu is in an advantageous position to contribute to peace efforts abroad , analysts say .
besides having an ample development budget , the eu has an expansive network of some 40,000 diplomats who can provide on the ground intelligence and support .
it also has a positive image in the world , according to the report .
" it is very important to not wait for a country to earn the ignominious label ' failed state ' to conduct civilian support operations , " geopolitical expert and author of " the second world , " parag khanna told deutsche welle .

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .
do we go on spending millions and taking heavy losses , while detablilizing an entire region , or do we look for an alternative such as direct engagement ?

" we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .

the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .

in a vote of confidence early on monday morning , the greek parliament voted along party lines to approve the new government , with all 160 members of papandreou 's socialist party voting for , and 140 members of opposition parties voting against .
papandreou came to power in a snap election earlier this month and now faces some tough challenges as greece tackles its first recession in 16 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 19.10.2009 exiled uighur leader criticises china at frankfurt book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebiya kadeer , the head of the world uighur congress rebiya kadeer , the exiled uighur leader , attended the frankfurt book fair on sunday and criticised the fact that china had been this year ’ s guest of honour .
she said that a country with such a poor human rights record did not deserve such a tribute .
china accuses kadeer of orchestrating riots in xinjiang province that resulted in some 200 deaths earlier this year .
kadeer rejects the allegations . rebiya kadeer has been fighting for the rights of the uighurs for almost 20 years .
china accuses her of conducting separatist activities , for which she even spent six years in jail until 2005 .
she now lives in exile in the united states .
the chinese government holds her responsible for the deadly violence that erupted in the capital of xinjiang urumqi this summer .
the killing of two uighurs at a factory in the southern province of guangdong led to people pouring out onto the streets of urumqi but kadeer insists that the protests were peaceful .
“ students and schoolchildren took part in the demonstrations , ” she said .
“ they were carrying chinese flags .
they wanted to say ‘ we are citizens of this state and we want to demonstrate peacefully but the incidents in guangdong have to be investigated . ’ ” 200 dead , 1,600 injured the protests turned deadly when fights broke out between the uighurs and han chinese .
over 200 people were killed and over 1,600 people were injured .
hundreds of people were arrested in the aftermath .
michael dillon , who teaches modern chinese history at the university of durham and has written a book about xinjiang estimates that a total of 40 people have gone on trial .
“ of those , 12 have been sentenced to death , ” he said .
“ the charges include murder , robbery and arson .
the chinese authorities have said that they want to clamp down very heavily on this . ”
however , he added that because the trials had not been open to foreign journalists and international observers , nobody really could confirm what had been going on exactly .
the xinjiang authorities have said that the families of the defendants and the victims were allowed to attend the trials .
" unfair trials and forced confessions " uighurs have complained that the trials are not fair and that they have not been allowed to be represented by the lawyers of their choice .
this has been confirmed by human rights watch which has said in a report that lawyers were effectively warned to be careful when accepting such cases .
the watchdog also claims that the authorities exercised their influence on the judges and prosecutors .
rebiya kadeer thinks that those who have been sentenced to death are not guilty and were forced to confess .
" cultural genocide " in xinjiang she argues that the authorities are acting illegally in xinjiang .
“ after we were occupied by china , we were given autonomy , ” she explains .
“ and according to the autonomy law , we can govern ourselves and maintain our traditions and identity .
but now cultural genocide is taking place against us and anybody who is against that is labelled a terrorist and a separatist . ”
kadeer insists that she favours only peaceful means as part of her fight for uighur interests .
she says that her several attempts to enter into dialogue with the chinese government have not been successful .
executions would be counterproductive in her view , an independent un commission should be allowed to go to xinjiang to form its own opinion , as well as to look into the situation of uighur prisoners in china .
she has also called for the death penalty to be abolished .
this view is supported by michael dillon who thinks any executions in xinjiang would be counterproductive .
“ although there might be some support if the death sentences are carried out from han people in xinjiang , it ’ s going to lead to even further resentment among the uighurs .
it ’ s not necessarily going to have the desired effect because it ’ s likely to create more tension and more conflict in the future . ”
three of the 12 people sentenced to death have been given a two-year reprieve , suggesting that their sentences will be commuted to life in prison .
four more people have been given life imprisonment .
although it is not exactly clear who has been sentenced to death there appears to be at least one han name .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .
christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat have been holding talks since september 2008 .
but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .

later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

the popular priest was murdered by the secret police . father jerzy popieluszko has been posthumously awarded poland 's highest distinction - the order of the white eagle - by president lech kaczynski , twenty-five years after his brutal murder .
the priest is considered a symbol of the church 's resistance against the communist regime , and his grave in warsaw is the most popular pilgrimage site in poland after czestochowa , the sacred mountain of the black madonna .
born in 1947 in northern poland , the charismatic young priest championed poland 's banned solidarity trade union , and denounced communism in passionate sermons from the pulpit of st. stanislaus kostka church in warsaw .
at the age of just thirty-seven , on october 19 , 1984 , popieluszko was kidnapped and assassinated by the country 's secret police .
his body was n't discovered until nearly two weeks later in a reservoir west of warsaw .

speaking during the second day of meetings being held by the environment ministers of the 17 nations making up the major economic forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in london , brown said that the time has come to stop pointing fingers and start negotiating a deal to replace the kyoto protocol at the end of the year in copenhagen .
" i believe we can do this .
i believe also that such an agreement not only must but can put the world on a trajectory to a maximum average global temperature increase of two degrees , " he added .

on the way to that goal , the world would have to reduce its emissions to 40 gigatons by 2020 and 35 gigatons by 2030 .
brown is one of the few mef leaders planning on attending negotiations in copenhagen this december .
the mef is responsible for an estimated 90 percent of the world 's current emissions .
the october 18-19 meeting is the latest in a us-instigated series of forums meant to build support for the un-backed process .
the london talks focused on how to turn a patchwork of national policies into an international deal , as well as on climate finance and technology cooperation. mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair opinion -pipe- 19.10.2009 opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody is talking about china .
but this year 's guest country was n't the only topic of discussion at the frankfurt book fair .
industry insiders had other worries as well , says dw 's gabriela schaaf . " everybody comes to frankfurt , because everybody comes to frankfurt " - that 's how publishing industry insiders describe the frankfurt book fair 's recipe for success .
it has a certain magnetic effect .
though the rights and licensing for books can be dealt with at any time of the year , it is only at the fair that industry representatives have the opportunity to sit face-to-face .
this is important for a business built on trust . but this year , not everyone came : several east european publishers stayed home due to a lack of state funding , and america 's biggest publishing houses sent far fewer people than in other years .
welcome to the frankfurt book fair in the year of the global financial crisis . fair organizers maintained that the industry , overall , is still doing quite well .
the lower turn-out does not represent a threat to the industry ; it was just a temporary phenomenon , they said . and the book market in germany is doing quite well by comparison - there was talk of a 2.8 percent growth in sales compared to last year .
nevertheless , things are changing - not least , the book itself . rarely has there been so much talk about digital media as in this year .
even though the e-book has n't become a best-seller yet , producers are already preparing for the big breakthrough .
germany is on the right track : the majority of publishers here keep their books in digital as well as paper form .
a branch-wide online portal is already up and running .
after all , nothing would be more fatal to the industry than to let all of the profit be swallowed up by google and co . there was also a lot of buzz in the run-up to the fair about the appearance of this year 's controversial guest country , china .
in the end , the official chinese organization committee struck a positive balance : their authors were welcomed and appeared satisfied with their closed-door agreement .
however , they repeated over and over again , like a mantra , that there was no censorship in china -lrb- but that authors may not break the law -rrb- . dialogue between the chinese delegation and the exiled authors and dissidents never took place - at least not in public .
more could and should have been done on this front if there had really been a desire .
the venue for the fair , which included two separate halls , spread widely apart , did n't exactly encourage discussion . the german media , however , engaged in a lively debate on the subject , which was one positive outcome of the book fair .
never before have we heard so much about china - its problems , objections , and taboo topics . argentina will be the guest country in 2010 , and that will surely be less touchy than this year .
as the largest book producer in latin america , it hopes to present its varied history and cultural diversity .
argentina hosts the most important book fair in latin america , and is an important partner of the frankfurt book fair . and then , hopefully , everybody will come again to frankfurt - because everybody comes to frankfurt . author : gabriela schaaf is dw 's literature expert -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dossier : frankfurt book fair from e-books to paperbacks or biographies to novels - the world 's largest book fair runs through sunday in frankfurt .
with china as the guest of honor , there 's room for literary discoveries , as well as political tension .
-lrb- 16.10.2009 -rrb- frankfurt book fair underway as germans read their way out of the recession not only did germany win the 2009 nobel prize for literature - german language books sales were up 2.8 percent over the last 12 months ! -lrb- 14.10.2009 -rrb- germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair the frankfurt book fair opens after a month of controversy over who is running the show - the german organizers or the chinese delegation , this year 's guest of honor .
but will diplomatic relations be affected ? -lrb- 14.10.2009 -rrb- feedback do you think there should have been more dialogue with china at the book fair ?

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .
do we go on spending millions and taking heavy losses , while detablilizing an entire region , or do we look for an alternative such as direct engagement ?

now the work can begin on overhauling greece 's economy and the national budget . greece 's newly elected prime minister george papandreou has won the backing of parliament for his incoming government .
in a vote of confidence early on monday morning , the greek parliament voted along party lines to approve the new government , with all 160 members of papandreou 's socialist party voting for , and 140 members of opposition parties voting against .
papandreou came to power in a snap election earlier this month and now faces some tough challenges as greece tackles its first recession in 16 years .
he must also address the highest debt in the country 's history and a budgetary deficit around 10 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , well over the three percent euro-zone limit .
the incoming prime minster has pledged to fix greece 's economy - which he described as " explosive " - as well as the " state of emergency " in the country 's finances .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .
do we go on spending millions and taking heavy losses , while detablilizing an entire region , or do we look for an alternative such as direct engagement ?

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .
christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat have been holding talks since september 2008 .
but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .
turkey has been urged to open its ports and airports to cyprus , whose government it still does not recognize. bk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german parties wo n't block turkey 's eu bid germany 's new government will not slam the door on turkey 's eu membership bid , according to sources close to the coalition talks .
however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry .

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .

"
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !

speaking during the second day of meetings being held by the environment ministers of the 17 nations making up the major economic forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in london , brown said that the time has come to stop pointing fingers and start negotiating a deal to replace the kyoto protocol at the end of the year in copenhagen .
" i believe we can do this .
i believe also that such an agreement not only must but can put the world on a trajectory to a maximum average global temperature increase of two degrees , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is one of the few mef country leaders personally making the trip to copenhagen british economist nicolas stern , who headed the stern review on the economics of climate change , has calculated that global emissions will have to be reduced to 20 gigatons per year by 2050 , down from the current level of 50 gigatons .
on the way to that goal , the world would have to reduce its emissions to 40 gigatons by 2020 and 35 gigatons by 2030 .
brown is one of the few mef leaders planning on attending negotiations in copenhagen this december .
the mef is responsible for an estimated 90 percent of the world 's current emissions .
the october 18-19 meeting is the latest in a us-instigated series of forums meant to build support for the un-backed process .
the london talks focused on how to turn a patchwork of national policies into an international deal , as well as on climate finance and technology cooperation. mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

but the type of shot a person gets is to depend on their position in society , leading to complaints about a ' second class ' swine-flu vaccine .
politicians , certain government employees and members of the german military are scheduled to receive one type of the swine flu vaccine , while average citizens in germany are to receive a different one .
the difference between the two vaccines is that the one meant for members of the government is said to have fewer side-effects .
it also lacks certain additives which are said to be present in the version for the general population .
a spokesperson for the german interior minister , quoted by the berliner zeitung newspaper , said that the vaccines marked for the government were ordered months ago , when there were no clear differences between the two vaccines .
she added that the other version was not a second-class vaccine .
according to a separate report in the mass-circulation bild newspaper , chancellor angela merkel and health minister ulla schmidt are planning on getting vaccinated with the shot provided to the general population .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .
christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat have been holding talks since september 2008 .
but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .
turkey has been urged to open its ports and airports to cyprus , whose government it still does not recognize. bk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to reporters outside the eu farm ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday , eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said that she was emptying her pockets to give the 280 million to eu farmers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month farmers from germany , france and belgium protested the falling prices by spraying milk on fields " that 's all i have .
i do n't have a special account in switzerland or anywhere else , " she added , suggesting the there was little chance that further help would be coming from the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
fischer boel did not give any specific details on what form the aid would take , but she did stress that it would be the european union , and not eu countries , that would make the final decision .
the money is to come out of next year 's eu budget .
last november , eu agriculture ministers agreed that they would lift milk production quotas by one percent annually before ultimately scrapping them in 2014 or 2015 .

speaking to reporters outside the eu farm ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday , eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said that she was emptying her pockets to give the 280 million to eu farmers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month farmers from germany , france and belgium protested the falling prices by spraying milk on fields " that 's all i have .
i do n't have a special account in switzerland or anywhere else , " she added , suggesting the there was little chance that further help would be coming from the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
fischer boel did not give any specific details on what form the aid would take , but she did stress that it would be the european union , and not eu countries , that would make the final decision .
the money is to come out of next year 's eu budget .
last november , eu agriculture ministers agreed that they would lift milk production quotas by one percent annually before ultimately scrapping them in 2014 or 2015 .
in recent months , however , tens of thousands of european farmers have held protests demanding support through financial or other means. mrm / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 19.10.2009 biden 's trip confirms eastern european defense is still on the us agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joe biden will mend wounded relations despite the scrapping of us eastern european missile defense plans , vice president biden 's trip to eastern europe presents fresh alternatives and confirms its security concerns are still a us priority us vice president joe biden kicks off a trip on tuesday that will take him to poland , the czech republic and romania and is meant to reiterate us commitment to eastern european defense .
critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

more and more often , the answer is : fire the coach !
but statistics argue against midseason dismissals . in one respect , the 2009-10 season has been typical of recent bundesliga campaigns .
four teams - mainz , hanover , bochum and hertha berlin - have parted ways with their head coaches .
and of the four , only mainz has significantly profited from the move .
as money has come to play an increasing role in the german league , so has the pressure to achieve short-term goals .
thus , clubs have become far quicker to axe coaches .
in the first ten years of the bundesliga 's existence , there was an average of five mid-season coaching changes per campaign .
the average is now almost nine .
“ last season , it looked as though the culture was improving , but we 've returned to the old method of hire and fire , “ horst zingraf , the president of the association of german football teachers , complained in a recent interview with dpa news agency .
in fact , nine coaches have involuntarily vacated their posts in the only past six months , meaning that half of the bundesliga clubs have been forced to swallow unwelcome costs .
but a look at the statistics suggests that teams might well have saved their money .
motley record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel koller , formerly of bochum , was another coach to get the axe this year empirical studies have shown that a change of coach by no means guarantees a team 's performance on the pitch will improve .
in a dissertation for the academy of sports in cologne , sports scientists sonja bick and daniel mahnken examined the 455 coaching changes in the german first and second division between 1981 and 2005 .
they found that the teams concerned only improved on average by one-half of a position in the table in their first four games under a new regime .
that picture of inefficiency is supported by a dissertation written by markus rothermel at the university of munich looking specifically at the 2004-5 season .
of four teams that made early coaching changes , hamburg and schalke benefited , while moenchengladbach and hansa rostock failed to improve or even got worse .
a study of the spanish first division by researchers juan de dios tena and david forrest tells a slightly different tale .
according to their statistics , teams with new coaches did tend to improve in the immediate short term - but only at home .
that 's probably due to improved support from fans .
“ appeasing fans can have on-the-field benefits , ” tena and forrest concluded .
“ it is consistent with the importance attributed to crowd support in the literature on home advantage in sports . ”
in other words , switching coaches may be a way of creating short-term optimism and grabbing a few extra points , but it wo n't solve fundamental flaws in a squad .
bick and mahnken concluded that significant improvements in the table were only achieved after new coaches had worked with players for twenty games or more .
still , grabbing a few points is a powerful argument for club managers staring into the abyss , and teams usually contend that in their own specific situation , they had no options .
so is a particular type of coaching change the answer ?
the doll factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second team coaches like mainz 's tuchel are one replacement option clubs often try to shake things up by promoting coaches of their amateur or development sides to the top job .
of the four firings this season , three - mainz , bochum , and hanover - fall into that category .
the clubs ' respective managers no doubt hope that their new coaches will replicate the success of thomas doll with hamburg a few years back .
in 2004 , the former coach of the hamburg amateurs took over a side in last place , having earned only 6 points in eight games .
his youthful enthusiasm caught on , and he led them to an eighth-place finish in may and a spot in the champions league one year later .
but teams can also survive by standing pat .
in 2006 , bochum were in the drop zone 14 rounds with only 12 points .
they stuck by marcel koller , the coach they chose to fire this season , and he also ended up in eighth - arguably a better rescue job since bochum is a far smaller club than hamburg .
this season , mainz 's thomas tuchel has inspired his squad to some big wins , most notably over bayern munich .
but there 's little reason to think he 's a long-term cure-all .
even if their teams stay up for a season , former amateur coaches usually find themselves quickly back in the relegation zone .
in fact , in recent years , no former amateur coach has established himself in the first division .
thomas doll , for instance , is currently employed in turkey .
firemen to the rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans meyer is the only so-called fireman with a perfect record the other type of new coach teams tend to hire is what germans call a “ firefighter , ” i.e. a veteran who 's brought in to puncture the egos of over-performing divas and restore discipline and tactical competence .
hertha have taken this route with friedhelm funkel .
the prototypical fireman is hans meyer .
the 66-year-old has saved not one , but three teams - hertha , nuremberg and moenchengladbach - from relegation in the past five seasons .
the problem is that there 's only one of him .
the other coaches usually considered firemen - peter neururer , joerg berger and funkel himself - have all failed in the past in their appointed short-term missions .
of the fifteen teams that have gotten relegated in the past five seasons , only five of them decided against a mid-season coaching change .
conversely , that means that ten potential saviors did not get the job done .
that 's in part because there 's a limit to what a coach can do to compensate for a squad 's inadequacies - as hertha 's friedhelm funkel knows .
he took over an unmotivated team , forced to rely on a 19-year-old goalkeeper who is clearly in over his head .
and in his first two matches in charge , the results were two bad losses , including a 3-nil drubbing last weekend by lowly nuremberg .
" you 're never absolutely helpless , but you do have your eyes opened in the odd situation , " a rattled funkel told reporters after that match .
" you see exactly what considerable improvements have to be made .
we 'll be doing that in the coming weeks . "
or , as history would suggest , perhaps not .

speaking during the second day of meetings being held by the environment ministers of the 17 nations making up the major economic forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in london , brown said that the time has come to stop pointing fingers and start negotiating a deal to replace the kyoto protocol at the end of the year in copenhagen .
" i believe we can do this .
i believe also that such an agreement not only must but can put the world on a trajectory to a maximum average global temperature increase of two degrees , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is one of the few mef country leaders personally making the trip to copenhagen british economist nicolas stern , who headed the stern review on the economics of climate change , has calculated that global emissions will have to be reduced to 20 gigatons per year by 2050 , down from the current level of 50 gigatons .
on the way to that goal , the world would have to reduce its emissions to 40 gigatons by 2020 and 35 gigatons by 2030 .
brown is one of the few mef leaders planning on attending negotiations in copenhagen this december .
the mef is responsible for an estimated 90 percent of the world 's current emissions .
the october 18-19 meeting is the latest in a us-instigated series of forums meant to build support for the un-backed process .
the london talks focused on how to turn a patchwork of national policies into an international deal , as well as on climate finance and technology cooperation. mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking during the second day of meetings being held by the environment ministers of the 17 nations making up the major economic forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in london , brown said that the time has come to stop pointing fingers and start negotiating a deal to replace the kyoto protocol at the end of the year in copenhagen .
" i believe we can do this .
i believe also that such an agreement not only must but can put the world on a trajectory to a maximum average global temperature increase of two degrees , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is one of the few mef country leaders personally making the trip to copenhagen british economist nicolas stern , who headed the stern review on the economics of climate change , has calculated that global emissions will have to be reduced to 20 gigatons per year by 2050 , down from the current level of 50 gigatons .
on the way to that goal , the world would have to reduce its emissions to 40 gigatons by 2020 and 35 gigatons by 2030 .
brown is one of the few mef leaders planning on attending negotiations in copenhagen this december .
the mef is responsible for an estimated 90 percent of the world 's current emissions .
the october 18-19 meeting is the latest in a us-instigated series of forums meant to build support for the un-backed process .
the london talks focused on how to turn a patchwork of national policies into an international deal , as well as on climate finance and technology cooperation. mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 19.10.2009 the eu is ' underperforming ' in the world 's conflict zones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilian missions currently operate in 12 conflict zones for 10 years the eu has proudly been deploying nation-building missions to the world 's worst conflict zones - from afghanistan , to iraq , to darfur .
but a new study says the eu is ' underperforming . ' this year marks the 10th anniversary of the european security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- , which has been deployed in 20 state-building operations across three continents , in the world 's worst conflict zones .
to honor the anniversary , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief , wrote a newspaper commentary recently praising the eu for a decade of promoting peace around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu civilian mission in afghanistan is short-staffed " from kabul to pristina , from ramallah to kinshasa , the eu is monitoring borders , overseeing peace agreements , training police forces , building up criminal justice systems and protecting shipping from pirate attacks , " solana wrote . " thanks to our achievements , we are receiving more and more calls to help in a crisis or after a war .
we have the credibility , the values and the will to do this . "
however , a recent report by the european council on foreign relations argues that eu missions , despite their potential , have so far been " small , lacking in ambition and strategically irrelevant . "
it cites an outdated security strategy , internal squabbles and red tape in brussels , and a failure to live up to personnel commitments as the major areas of esdp underperformance in the world 's trouble spots .
broken promises in 2004 , the eu devised an ambitious set of " civilian headline goals " in order to ensure that each member state committed enough civilian troops .
however , during the last 5 years the eu has only deployed half the number it promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief , javier solana acknowledges that eu civilian missions need to be more efficient the report states that money is not the issue ; the current esdp budget allows for 1,500 more civilian staff members than are currently aiding peace efforts in one of a dozen missions .
in afghanistan , for example , the eu police mission is operating at below half of its budgetary capacity .
" most member states do not take the development of civilian capacity seriously .
there 's a small group of states that do , but the majority of member states simply do n't take it seriously enough , -lsb- and -rsb- do n't invest enough money in it , " the report 's co-author , daniel korski , told deutsche welle .
germany was among those identified by the report as a top performer - along with denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - which have all invested heavily in civilian training and recruitment programs .
other eu members were criticized for not doing enough .
the ' bosnia ' template and red tape in addition , the report claims eu missions tend to deploy the same strategic template in countries as varied as afghanistan , iraq and the democratic republic of the congo - an approach that has " proved ineffectual . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilians helped monitor a peace deal in aceh , indonesia in 2005 it is known as the ' bosnia template ' , and it was first implemented in 2003 .
in that conflict , eu police focused on providing technical assistance to the local police and judiciary while nato took care of security .
but the circumstances on the ground in many failing states today can vary drastically .

but a new study says the eu is ' underperforming . ' this year marks the 10th anniversary of the european security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- , which has been deployed in 20 state-building operations across three continents , in the world 's worst conflict zones .
to honor the anniversary , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief , wrote a newspaper commentary recently praising the eu for a decade of promoting peace around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu civilian mission in afghanistan is short-staffed " from kabul to pristina , from ramallah to kinshasa , the eu is monitoring borders , overseeing peace agreements , training police forces , building up criminal justice systems and protecting shipping from pirate attacks , " solana wrote . " thanks to our achievements , we are receiving more and more calls to help in a crisis or after a war .
we have the credibility , the values and the will to do this . "
however , a recent report by the european council on foreign relations argues that eu missions , despite their potential , have so far been " small , lacking in ambition and strategically irrelevant . "
it cites an outdated security strategy , internal squabbles and red tape in brussels , and a failure to live up to personnel commitments as the major areas of esdp underperformance in the world 's trouble spots .
broken promises in 2004 , the eu devised an ambitious set of " civilian headline goals " in order to ensure that each member state committed enough civilian troops .

in afghanistan , for example , the eu police mission is operating at below half of its budgetary capacity .
" most member states do not take the development of civilian capacity seriously .
there 's a small group of states that do , but the majority of member states simply do n't take it seriously enough , -lsb- and -rsb- do n't invest enough money in it , " the report 's co-author , daniel korski , told deutsche welle .
germany was among those identified by the report as a top performer - along with denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - which have all invested heavily in civilian training and recruitment programs .
other eu members were criticized for not doing enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 19.10.2009 the eu is ' underperforming ' in the world 's conflict zones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilian missions currently operate in 12 conflict zones for 10 years the eu has proudly been deploying nation-building missions to the world 's worst conflict zones - from afghanistan , to iraq , to darfur .
but a new study says the eu is ' underperforming . ' this year marks the 10th anniversary of the european security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- , which has been deployed in 20 state-building operations across three continents , in the world 's worst conflict zones .
to honor the anniversary , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief , wrote a newspaper commentary recently praising the eu for a decade of promoting peace around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu civilian mission in afghanistan is short-staffed " from kabul to pristina , from ramallah to kinshasa , the eu is monitoring borders , overseeing peace agreements , training police forces , building up criminal justice systems and protecting shipping from pirate attacks , " solana wrote . " thanks to our achievements , we are receiving more and more calls to help in a crisis or after a war .
we have the credibility , the values and the will to do this . "
however , a recent report by the european council on foreign relations argues that eu missions , despite their potential , have so far been " small , lacking in ambition and strategically irrelevant . "
it cites an outdated security strategy , internal squabbles and red tape in brussels , and a failure to live up to personnel commitments as the major areas of esdp underperformance in the world 's trouble spots .
broken promises in 2004 , the eu devised an ambitious set of " civilian headline goals " in order to ensure that each member state committed enough civilian troops .
however , during the last 5 years the eu has only deployed half the number it promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief , javier solana acknowledges that eu civilian missions need to be more efficient the report states that money is not the issue ; the current esdp budget allows for 1,500 more civilian staff members than are currently aiding peace efforts in one of a dozen missions .
in afghanistan , for example , the eu police mission is operating at below half of its budgetary capacity .
" most member states do not take the development of civilian capacity seriously .
there 's a small group of states that do , but the majority of member states simply do n't take it seriously enough , -lsb- and -rsb- do n't invest enough money in it , " the report 's co-author , daniel korski , told deutsche welle .
germany was among those identified by the report as a top performer - along with denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - which have all invested heavily in civilian training and recruitment programs .
other eu members were criticized for not doing enough .
the ' bosnia ' template and red tape in addition , the report claims eu missions tend to deploy the same strategic template in countries as varied as afghanistan , iraq and the democratic republic of the congo - an approach that has " proved ineffectual . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilians helped monitor a peace deal in aceh , indonesia in 2005 it is known as the ' bosnia template ' , and it was first implemented in 2003 .
in that conflict , eu police focused on providing technical assistance to the local police and judiciary while nato took care of security .
but the circumstances on the ground in many failing states today can vary drastically .
" in many of the future theaters of conflict , it 's not going to be easy to find other institutions to provide security whether that be in congo or indeed other parts of asia , " said korski , adding that eu civilian missions will now have to adapt to " operate across a spectrum of tasks . "
brussels-based institutions - namely the european council and european commission - were also earmarked for hampering eu nation-building efforts , due to internal squabbling and a " culture of mismanagment , " though the lisbon treaty reform may improve the way the bloc operates .
eu advantage what to do about failed states may be one of the biggest challenges facing the international community , and the eu is in an advantageous position to contribute to peace efforts abroad , analysts say .
besides having an ample development budget , the eu has an expansive network of some 40,000 diplomats who can provide on the ground intelligence and support .
it also has a positive image in the world , according to the report .
" it is very important to not wait for a country to earn the ignominious label ' failed state ' to conduct civilian support operations , " geopolitical expert and author of " the second world , " parag khanna told deutsche welle . " i believe that european investments and efforts have already prevented north african states , for example , from deteriorating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 19.10.2009 kurdish fighters show support for turkish plans to expand kurdish rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish security waiting for the " peace caravan " a group of 34 kurds has crossed from bases in iraq to turkey in what the kurdish rebel group pkk has called a " peace caravan . "
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .
do we go on spending millions and taking heavy losses , while detablilizing an entire region , or do we look for an alternative such as direct engagement ?

" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

born in 1947 in northern poland , the charismatic young priest championed poland 's banned solidarity trade union , and denounced communism in passionate sermons from the pulpit of st. stanislaus kostka church in warsaw .
at the age of just thirty-seven , on october 19 , 1984 , popieluszko was kidnapped and assassinated by the country 's secret police .
his body was n't discovered until nearly two weeks later in a reservoir west of warsaw .
around 250,000 mourners attended popieluszko 's funeral .
four people were charged and served jail time for the crime , but have since been released .
photos of father jerzy popieluszko were splashed across polish newspapers on monday as the country remembered him . speaking to polish radio , the warsaw archbishop kazimierz nycz called the death of father popieluszko one of the saddest days in the history of the church. vj / epd / kna / ap editor : michael lawton charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .

the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .
christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat have been holding talks since september 2008 .
but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .
do we go on spending millions and taking heavy losses , while detablilizing an entire region , or do we look for an alternative such as direct engagement ?

nevertheless , things are changing - not least , the book itself . rarely has there been so much talk about digital media as in this year .
even though the e-book has n't become a best-seller yet , producers are already preparing for the big breakthrough .
germany is on the right track : the majority of publishers here keep their books in digital as well as paper form .
a branch-wide online portal is already up and running .
after all , nothing would be more fatal to the industry than to let all of the profit be swallowed up by google and co . there was also a lot of buzz in the run-up to the fair about the appearance of this year 's controversial guest country , china .
in the end , the official chinese organization committee struck a positive balance : their authors were welcomed and appeared satisfied with their closed-door agreement .
however , they repeated over and over again , like a mantra , that there was no censorship in china -lrb- but that authors may not break the law -rrb- . dialogue between the chinese delegation and the exiled authors and dissidents never took place - at least not in public .
more could and should have been done on this front if there had really been a desire .
the venue for the fair , which included two separate halls , spread widely apart , did n't exactly encourage discussion . the german media , however , engaged in a lively debate on the subject , which was one positive outcome of the book fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the type of shot a person gets is to depend on their position in society , leading to complaints about a ' second class ' swine-flu vaccine .
politicians , certain government employees and members of the german military are scheduled to receive one type of the swine flu vaccine , while average citizens in germany are to receive a different one .
the difference between the two vaccines is that the one meant for members of the government is said to have fewer side-effects .
it also lacks certain additives which are said to be present in the version for the general population .
a spokesperson for the german interior minister , quoted by the berliner zeitung newspaper , said that the vaccines marked for the government were ordered months ago , when there were no clear differences between the two vaccines .
she added that the other version was not a second-class vaccine .
according to a separate report in the mass-circulation bild newspaper , chancellor angela merkel and health minister ulla schmidt are planning on getting vaccinated with the shot provided to the general population .

the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as discussions enter their final full week , they appear to have made progress on one big item - tax cuts .
according to public broadcaster ard , the two sides have agreed to tax cuts of 20 to 23 billion euros -lrb- $ 30-34 billion -rrb- .
this is significantly less than the 35 billion the fdp had promised during its election campaign , and much closer to the 20 billion in tax cuts that the cdu was looking for .
however , what has n't been agreed is how to finance those tax cuts and both cdu and fdp officials have said they wo n't be making any announcement until mid-week at the earliest .
according to georg fahrenschon , finance minister in the csu government in the southern state of bavaria , the goal now is to use any tax cuts as a means to boost the economy .
the working group charged with hammering out the details of a deal on tax and budgetary policy is meeting again this monday under the direction of merkel 's chief of staff , thomas de maziere .

chief negotiators from both sides – current cdu family minister ursula von der leyen and philipp roesler from the fdp – have indicated the talks have taken a huge step forward .
juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of the north rhine-westphalia , did n't rule out premium increases for health and unemployment insurance .
" of course we are intensively contemplating where we can save money , " ruettgers told ard , " and that includes premiums . "
as negotiations continue , both sides are extremely aware of just how much time pressure they are under .
for almost two weeks they have been holding meetings to hammer out the new center-right coalition .
they have given themselves just a few more days to finalize coalition agreement , and they have n't even gotten to the sensitive topic of cabinet posts yet. mrm / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "

biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

but all he had to offer turkey was guarded support for eu membership . barely a fortnight into his tenure as prime minister , papandreou has made clear his willingness to engage in his country 's perennial conflict with turkey over cyprus .
having visited istanbul earlier this month , he held talks with president demetris christofias , the greek cypriot leader , in nicosia on monday , hoping to forge a common front on the island 's reunification and turkey 's eu bid .
in a marked departure from his predecessor 's passivity on the issue , papandreou , who is also his country 's foreign minister , declared that cyprus would be greece 's foreign policy priority under his leadership .
bildunterschrift : greek cypriot president demetris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat are currently engaged in negotiations a new spirit christofias and papandreou declared themselves in favor of turkey 's entry to the european union , at least in principle .
" the goal is for turkey to become a full member , " papandreou told reporters , " i am not in favor of a special association of turkey with the european union as long as it fulfills its obligations . "
both papandreou and christofias expressed the belief that turkey 's eu course would be to their mutual benefit and vowed to continue their close cooperation to promote a solution to the cyprus problem .
credited with boosting ties with neighbouring turkey when he was foreign minister in the 1990s , in cooperation with turkey 's late foreign minister ismail cem , papandreou said " this is an issue which we can either solve and thus unite us , or keep us divided . "
central problems remain but papandreou did not alter greece 's conditions for progress .
greece and cyprus have made the continued presence of more than 35,000 turkish troops in the northern third of the island a key obstacle to turkey 's entry to the eu .
" i will always be sincere about problems that divide us and problems that we must solve , and a major problem is that there is still occupation in the cyprus republic , " papandreou said , " it can not be permitted for turkey to have occupation troops in an eu member state , especially for a candidate country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is currently divided by a un-administered border turkey 's eu bid comes under review in december , and papandreou 's statement comes at a crucial juncture in un-backed peace negotiations .
christofias and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat have been holding talks since september 2008 .
but progress has been slow , with the two sides remaining seriously divided on the issues of security , property and land swaps .
they are next due to meet on wednesday and thursday .
turkey invaded northern cyprus in response to a brief greek-inspired coup in 1974 , and has kept a strong military presence there ever since .
the island is now in the eu represented by greek cypriots , but eu membership is suspended in the north , where the breakaway turkish cypriot state recognized only by ankara .
turkey has been urged to open its ports and airports to cyprus , whose government it still does not recognize. bk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 19.10.2009 kurdish fighters show support for turkish plans to expand kurdish rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish security waiting for the " peace caravan " a group of 34 kurds has crossed from bases in iraq to turkey in what the kurdish rebel group pkk has called a " peace caravan . "
they hope their surrender will help resolve a decades-old conflict . the group of men and women , including eight pkk fighters and 26 kurdish refugees , smiled as they entered turkish territory on monday , crossing over from the iraqi kurdish region , where most of the estimated 10,000 rebels are based .
they were immediately detained by turkish security forces .
the symbolic move came in response to a government initiative to end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives , displaced thousands and led to allegations of gross human rights violations .
the surrender was announced over the weekend by a pkk official who stressed that it was a gesture to the turkish government in response to its democratization initiative .
the initiative aims to bring to an end to the 26-year conflict between the turkish state and the pkk .
an important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish kurds demonstrate in support of kurdish rebels in istanbul “ it is a very good sign , it is one first fruit of the democratic initiative , ” said ibrahim kalin allen , an advisor to the turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan .
he added that he hoped this first step would speed up the entire process .
the pkk has been fighting turkish forces since 1984 .
although the group originally sought the creation of a separate kurdish state , it now calls for improved rights for turkey 's kurds , believed to account for roughly a fifth of turkey 's population .
prime minister erdogan has indicated the country is considering far-reaching steps to resolve the conflict .
at the beginning of the year , turkish state tv took a ground-breaking step and launched a kurdish-language tv channel .
talks which have included the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , began just a few months ago .
the government has also reached out to the kurdish leadership in neighboring northern iraq . until recently , ankara accused iraqi kurds of working with the pkk .
the government opposes an amnesty for the pkk a spokesman for one of the ruling iraqi kurdish parties , saffeen diyazee , welcomed the surrender , but cautioned that the government 's words of peace must now turn into concrete steps .
“ there is not a solid idea , or at least publicly there is no solid project , " he said .
" we hope ideas can develop and can be formulated into a state policy , something solid , something more tangible which can guarantee an end to this violence , something that should be welcomed by all parties . ”
erdogan and the army have ruled out any role for the pkk in the government initiative , but have said the state will be generous with pkk militants who surrender if it is determined they were not involved in attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 19.10.2009 german child welfare payments face constitutional test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.7 million children in germany live on hartz iv the controversial unemployment benefit reform known as hartz iv faces its first major constitutional challenge .
the decision will have serious consequences for angela merkel 's new government . the children 's allowances included in the so-called hartz iv benefit reforms introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government in 2005 look likely to be found unfair by germany 's equivalent of the supreme court .
hearings into cases brought by regional and federal courts are to begin on tuesday .
critics argue that the way payments for children of hartz iv recipients are calculated is too simple .
while a complex system exists to assess the needs and means of adults , payments for children are worked out by a rule-of-thumb percentage based on their age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz iv has caused bitter protests in germany since its introduction in 2005 children aged under 14 receive 60 percent of the adult 's allowance , while children between 14 and 17 receive 80 percent .
but in reality , children receive significantly less than this because the authorities deduct a standard government payment of 154 euros -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- which is paid out for all children .
1.7 million children in germany are dependent on hartz iv payments .
in one case , a couple with a single child ended up receiving only 53 euros extra .
according to critics of the system , in many cases the rules amount to state-sanctioned child poverty .
reforms necessary monika paulat , president of the german social court commission , an interdisciplinary legal panel of lawyers , doctors , politicians and representatives of the relevant state bodies , supported the complaints of those appealing to the court .
" everyone is assuming that the constitutional court will conclude that the standard hartv iv rates for children are unconstitutional , " paulat said in an interview with news magazine der spiegel .
" the law was driven through very quickly , and only afterwards did it become clear what had n't been thought through . "
paulat is calling for the establishment of an independent commission that will calculate the needs of children in the future .
the welfare organization caritas echoed these calls for an independent appraisal of the hartz iv rates for children .
caritas general secretary georg cremer said authorities should take into account the particular needs of young children , the costs of education , and the cost of activities outside school such as sports clubs and music lessons .
" poor children need to be materially secure , " cremer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany looks set to rise as a result of the financial crisis both the federal social court and the social court of the state of hesse have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the standard hartz iv rates in the past few months , and it is their findings which will be investigated at the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
a decision is not expected until the beginning of 2010 .
merkel needs to re-think according to media reports , the constitutional court is taking the reform of hartz iv extremely seriously , and intends to reassess the legality of all hartz iv payments , including those for adults .
if , as is expected , the court decides that the system for working out unemployment payments is unfair , the recently elected government , a coalition of angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free liberal party , will be forced to create new standard rates .
this is likely to cost a lot more than the 300 million euros the new government has already earmarked for its own alterations to hartz iv. bk / ap / kna editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .
" they have n't dramatized the situation , " an unnamed civil servant was quoted as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 19.10.2009 the eu is ' underperforming ' in the world 's conflict zones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu civilian missions currently operate in 12 conflict zones for 10 years the eu has proudly been deploying nation-building missions to the world 's worst conflict zones - from afghanistan , to iraq , to darfur .
but a new study says the eu is ' underperforming . ' this year marks the 10th anniversary of the european security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- , which has been deployed in 20 state-building operations across three continents , in the world 's worst conflict zones .
to honor the anniversary , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief , wrote a newspaper commentary recently praising the eu for a decade of promoting peace around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu civilian mission in afghanistan is short-staffed " from kabul to pristina , from ramallah to kinshasa , the eu is monitoring borders , overseeing peace agreements , training police forces , building up criminal justice systems and protecting shipping from pirate attacks , " solana wrote . " thanks to our achievements , we are receiving more and more calls to help in a crisis or after a war .
we have the credibility , the values and the will to do this . "
however , a recent report by the european council on foreign relations argues that eu missions , despite their potential , have so far been " small , lacking in ambition and strategically irrelevant . "
it cites an outdated security strategy , internal squabbles and red tape in brussels , and a failure to live up to personnel commitments as the major areas of esdp underperformance in the world 's trouble spots .
broken promises in 2004 , the eu devised an ambitious set of " civilian headline goals " in order to ensure that each member state committed enough civilian troops .
however , during the last 5 years the eu has only deployed half the number it promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief , javier solana acknowledges that eu civilian missions need to be more efficient the report states that money is not the issue ; the current esdp budget allows for 1,500 more civilian staff members than are currently aiding peace efforts in one of a dozen missions .
in afghanistan , for example , the eu police mission is operating at below half of its budgetary capacity .
" most member states do not take the development of civilian capacity seriously .
there 's a small group of states that do , but the majority of member states simply do n't take it seriously enough , -lsb- and -rsb- do n't invest enough money in it , " the report 's co-author , daniel korski , told deutsche welle .
germany was among those identified by the report as a top performer - along with denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - which have all invested heavily in civilian training and recruitment programs .
other eu members were criticized for not doing enough .
the ' bosnia ' template and red tape in addition , the report claims eu missions tend to deploy the same strategic template in countries as varied as afghanistan , iraq and the democratic republic of the congo - an approach that has " proved ineffectual . "

in that conflict , eu police focused on providing technical assistance to the local police and judiciary while nato took care of security .
but the circumstances on the ground in many failing states today can vary drastically .
" in many of the future theaters of conflict , it 's not going to be easy to find other institutions to provide security whether that be in congo or indeed other parts of asia , " said korski , adding that eu civilian missions will now have to adapt to " operate across a spectrum of tasks . "
brussels-based institutions - namely the european council and european commission - were also earmarked for hampering eu nation-building efforts , due to internal squabbling and a " culture of mismanagment , " though the lisbon treaty reform may improve the way the bloc operates .
eu advantage what to do about failed states may be one of the biggest challenges facing the international community , and the eu is in an advantageous position to contribute to peace efforts abroad , analysts say .
besides having an ample development budget , the eu has an expansive network of some 40,000 diplomats who can provide on the ground intelligence and support .
it also has a positive image in the world , according to the report .
" it is very important to not wait for a country to earn the ignominious label ' failed state ' to conduct civilian support operations , " geopolitical expert and author of " the second world , " parag khanna told deutsche welle .

speaking to reporters outside the eu farm ministers meeting in luxembourg on monday , eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said that she was emptying her pockets to give the 280 million to eu farmers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last month farmers from germany , france and belgium protested the falling prices by spraying milk on fields " that 's all i have .
i do n't have a special account in switzerland or anywhere else , " she added , suggesting the there was little chance that further help would be coming from the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
fischer boel did not give any specific details on what form the aid would take , but she did stress that it would be the european union , and not eu countries , that would make the final decision .
the money is to come out of next year 's eu budget .
last november , eu agriculture ministers agreed that they would lift milk production quotas by one percent annually before ultimately scrapping them in 2014 or 2015 .
in recent months , however , tens of thousands of european farmers have held protests demanding support through financial or other means. mrm / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the merrill lynch study said its german competitors are currently holding 650 billion euros -lrb- $ 970 billion -rrb- of " problematic " assets - equal to one quarter of the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
it said there was an acute need for 60 billion euros of write-downs .
" german banks appear to have a considerable backlog of non-performing loans , " der spiegel quoted the study , adding that the nation 's lenders were making little progress compared with international efforts to overcome the financial crisis .
little progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's balance sheet clean-up could prove costly the study said germany 's regional state lenders appeared to be the most reluctant to correct the values of their toxic assets .
duesseldorf-based westlb , for example , has only made write-downs on four percent of its 30-billion-euro junk bond portfolio , while its stuttgart-based counterpart lbbw has downgraded just 11 percent of bad assets worth an estimated 22.5 billion euros .
meanwhile , germany 's second largest bank , commerzbank , is yet to tackle three quarters of its structured debt despite receiving some 18 billion euros of state aid .
merrill lynch analysts said balance sheet corrections and other risks stemming from its eastern europe operations could wipe out 13.6 percent of commerzbank 's total value .
accurate figures ?
der spiegel reported that the financial institutions named in the study criticized the document for being too general and even misleading in its analysis of their portfolios .
but the magazine also said merrill lynch analysts had succeeded in capturing the attention of high-ranking government officials at both the finance ministry and the chancellery .
" they have n't dramatized the situation , " an unnamed civil servant was quoted as saying .

critics questioned the us 's intentions towards eastern europe after president obama shelved a bush-era plan to build a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic following criticism from russia .
critics have said biden is on a damage control mission to amend relations which were somewhat damaged after the us withdrawal from the missile defense plan .
the white house has strongly rejected the assertion .
biden will meet with heads of state and policymakers on a broad range of issues , particularly security concerns , and will also meet with citizens to discuss expanding trade and investment , strengthening democracy and furthering cooperation between the us and eastern europe .
polish and czech leaders have affirmed ties with the us remain solid and have generally downplayed their anger over president obama 's decision to scrap the missile defence plan and seek less contentious alternatives .
the director of the institute of international relations prague , petr drulak , told deutsche welle , " it 's expected that on this trip vice president biden will bring some cookies to sweeten the bitter experience eastern european leaders had when president obama scrapped the missile defense plan .
policymakers in poland and the czech republic felt disappointed and deserted when this happened , as they had invested a lot of political commitment into it and laboured to rally public support . "
alternative proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sm-3 missile is part of the alternative system biden will be presenting the us is well prepared for an inevitable resurgence of the debate over missile defense during biden 's trip and has already produced less controversial alternatives .
biden is to present a new offer for a different anti-missile shield in eastern europe . president obama has commissioned a simpler system that will counter iran 's alleged ballistic missile program .
the new missile shield would be mobile and would contain both surface and ground systems , as well as a stationary system in poland based on sm-3 interceptor missiles . the new alternatives have put russian anxieties permanently to rest .
a white house spokesman said that the us is confident the host nations will recognize the new missile defense plans meet their security concerns .
us accused of giving in to russia the missile shield system had been a bone of contention between washington and moscow since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
the plan also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which were unable to agree on the tenability of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us said it needed missile defense to counter threats from rogue states like north korea and iran the initial us blueprint included a radar station in the czech republic and 10 interceptors in poland directed at ballistic missiles from rogue states such as north korea and iran .
russian officials attacked this plan , saying the project critically jeopardized its security .
one of the major contentions from the russian perspective was that the radar installation to be based in the czech republic would have been able to collect information about all movements in russian airspace up to the urals mountains .
president dmitri medvedev , in his first state of the nation speech in november 2008 , declared russia would deploy short-range iskander missiles to russia 's western enclave of kaliningrad , sandwiched between poland and lithuania to " neutralize , if necessary , a missile defense system . "
after months of consideration and review , in a move highly criticized as conceding to russia and favoring us diplomatic interests at the expense of eastern european concerns , president obama decided to abandon the missile defense plan .
poland 's chief of national security , aleksander szczyglo , called it a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one .
joe biden will have to use his trip , at least partly , to demonstrate to eastern europe that any new plan will be as sensitive to the region 's political and strategic interests as the old .

some analysts , however , say the practice of direct local funding may be an alternative to prolonged war . a report published in the times newspaper last week claimed that italian forces operating in the region around sarobi , 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- east of kabul , had bribed taliban warlords not to attack their troops . the british newspaper carried statements from a taliban commander who claimed the italians paid tens of thousands of dollars in a deal which allegedly meant italian troops would not step on territory the taliban controlled - and , in return , the militants would not attack . " we were told that our high-rank commanders met with the italian soldiers and they agreed a deal that neither side should attack one another , " mohammad ismayel , a mid-level local taliban commander , known simply as commander ismayel , told the times .
" we were informed at that time that we should not attack the nato troops . " however , when the italians pulled out in july 2008 , they allegedly neglected to mention the arrangement to the french troops taking over - and did not inform the warlords of the changing of the guard .
as a result , a more aggressive french approach caused anger among the taliban leaders who believed that the italians had reneged on the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is claimed french troops died because the deal was unknown " when the french soldiers came to sarobi they started making attacks on us , " commander ismayel told the newspaper .
" for a while we did n't know that they were french soldiers and we thought that the italians had broken the deal and started fighting .
later on we got information that they were not italian soldiers ; they were french .
then we started fighting with them . " within a month of the handover , the taliban had killed 10 french soldiers and injured 21 others in the area .
the result was an escalation of fighting in the region with many of the taliban leaders linked to the italian deal killed in the subsequent nato surge and by hit squads from the french special forces . the italians issued strong denials with defense minister ignazio la russa calling the allegations " complete rubbish " and the office of prime minister silvio berlusconi refuting claims that any official policy of engagement with the taliban exists .
french military sources also denied the allegations , despite rumors of an angry response toward the italians from the élysée palace . allegations stir debate on warlord engagement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban gets funding from a number of gulf states while some defense analysts believe that this could be far from an isolated case , others believe that focusing on the allegations surrounding the italians clouds a debate which is growing louder ; that of directly engaging with local warlords in an attempt to end what is looking increasingly like an unwinnable war . " while this story does have a credible sound to it , it doesn ’ t really matter if it 's true or not , " giles merritt , the director of the brussels-based think tank security & defense agenda , told deutsche welle .
" the main issue is that this is precisely what the west should be doing anyway .
there is a strong argument for paying off the local leaders and warlords .
afghanistan is desperately poor and needs money , and the afghans are going to get money from anywhere they can .
right now , about $ 100 to $ 400 million a year -lrb- 66.9 million - 267.7 million euros -rrb- is coming into the taliban war chest from saudi arabia and other gulf states . " merritt believes the west should be the main power contributing to the local afghan economy and should also be buying up the opium crop , making it into morphine for use in western medicine .
this , he says , would dilute outside influence and create a much more positive effect than having thousands of western troops , which are now seen as an occupying power , on the ground . concerns over directly funding the taliban he concedes that there would be huge political problems arising from this approach , however , with evidence that a lot of the money flooding into local afghan communities ends up in the hands of the taliban .
while the structure of afghan society and government makes determining who is actually receiving funds terribly difficult , merritt believes that this should not be used as a reason to ignore this potential strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato forces are engaged in a difficult asymmetric war " who is the taliban , who is a local warlord and who is al qaeda ? " asked merritt .
" the borders are so blurred .
it is one of the biggest mistakes being made in afghanistan that we 're still dealing in very black and white western terms .
afghanistan is not organized this way .
the war is being fought as a conventional conflict between central governments , but there really is no central government .
that is why dealing locally with the leaders at that level is the best option . " merritt believes that , despite the idea sounding out-dated and colonial , an approach closer to the british strategy of the early last century could be the most effective . current strategy based on false impression of conflict " the brits knew that people would n't stay bought for long , " he said .
" so they paid regular small amounts to the local leaders and if there was an uprising or insurrection , they would cut the funding , launch a heavy attack and then resume payment once the uprising had been quelled .
it sounds old-fashioned but it is becoming clear that this is an unwinnable war with the current strategy .
do we go on spending millions and taking heavy losses , while detablilizing an entire region , or do we look for an alternative such as direct engagement ?

now the work can begin on overhauling greece 's economy and the national budget . greece 's newly elected prime minister george papandreou has won the backing of parliament for his incoming government .
in a vote of confidence early on monday morning , the greek parliament voted along party lines to approve the new government , with all 160 members of papandreou 's socialist party voting for , and 140 members of opposition parties voting against .
papandreou came to power in a snap election earlier this month and now faces some tough challenges as greece tackles its first recession in 16 years .
he must also address the highest debt in the country 's history and a budgetary deficit around 10 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , well over the three percent euro-zone limit .
the incoming prime minster has pledged to fix greece 's economy - which he described as " explosive " - as well as the " state of emergency " in the country 's finances . " we have large hidden debts and spending , an unprecedented lack of competitiveness and social insurance funds in a state of penury , " papandreou told parliament .
renewable energy , increased education spending , and a crack down on tax evasion are also on the new government 's agenda , papandreou said. mz / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as discussions enter their final full week , they appear to have made progress on one big item - tax cuts .
according to public broadcaster ard , the two sides have agreed to tax cuts of 20 to 23 billion euros -lrb- $ 30-34 billion -rrb- .
this is significantly less than the 35 billion the fdp had promised during its election campaign , and much closer to the 20 billion in tax cuts that the cdu was looking for .
however , what has n't been agreed is how to finance those tax cuts and both cdu and fdp officials have said they wo n't be making any announcement until mid-week at the earliest .
according to georg fahrenschon , finance minister in the csu government in the southern state of bavaria , the goal now is to use any tax cuts as a means to boost the economy .
the working group charged with hammering out the details of a deal on tax and budgetary policy is meeting again this monday under the direction of merkel 's chief of staff , thomas de maziere .

chief negotiators from both sides – current cdu family minister ursula von der leyen and philipp roesler from the fdp – have indicated the talks have taken a huge step forward .
juergen ruettgers , premier of the state of the north rhine-westphalia , did n't rule out premium increases for health and unemployment insurance .
" of course we are intensively contemplating where we can save money , " ruettgers told ard , " and that includes premiums . "
as negotiations continue , both sides are extremely aware of just how much time pressure they are under .
for almost two weeks they have been holding meetings to hammer out the new center-right coalition .
they have given themselves just a few more days to finalize coalition agreement , and they have n't even gotten to the sensitive topic of cabinet posts yet. mrm / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the popular priest was murdered by the secret police . father jerzy popieluszko has been posthumously awarded poland 's highest distinction - the order of the white eagle - by president lech kaczynski , twenty-five years after his brutal murder .
the priest is considered a symbol of the church 's resistance against the communist regime , and his grave in warsaw is the most popular pilgrimage site in poland after czestochowa , the sacred mountain of the black madonna .
born in 1947 in northern poland , the charismatic young priest championed poland 's banned solidarity trade union , and denounced communism in passionate sermons from the pulpit of st. stanislaus kostka church in warsaw .
at the age of just thirty-seven , on october 19 , 1984 , popieluszko was kidnapped and assassinated by the country 's secret police .
his body was n't discovered until nearly two weeks later in a reservoir west of warsaw .
around 250,000 mourners attended popieluszko 's funeral .
four people were charged and served jail time for the crime , but have since been released .
photos of father jerzy popieluszko were splashed across polish newspapers on monday as the country remembered him . speaking to polish radio , the warsaw archbishop kazimierz nycz called the death of father popieluszko one of the saddest days in the history of the church. vj / epd / kna / ap editor : michael lawton charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year 's guest country was n't the only topic of discussion at the frankfurt book fair .
industry insiders had other worries as well , says dw 's gabriela schaaf . " everybody comes to frankfurt , because everybody comes to frankfurt " - that 's how publishing industry insiders describe the frankfurt book fair 's recipe for success .
it has a certain magnetic effect .
though the rights and licensing for books can be dealt with at any time of the year , it is only at the fair that industry representatives have the opportunity to sit face-to-face .
this is important for a business built on trust . but this year , not everyone came : several east european publishers stayed home due to a lack of state funding , and america 's biggest publishing houses sent far fewer people than in other years .
welcome to the frankfurt book fair in the year of the global financial crisis . fair organizers maintained that the industry , overall , is still doing quite well .
the lower turn-out does not represent a threat to the industry ; it was just a temporary phenomenon , they said . and the book market in germany is doing quite well by comparison - there was talk of a 2.8 percent growth in sales compared to last year .
nevertheless , things are changing - not least , the book itself . rarely has there been so much talk about digital media as in this year .
even though the e-book has n't become a best-seller yet , producers are already preparing for the big breakthrough .
germany is on the right track : the majority of publishers here keep their books in digital as well as paper form .
a branch-wide online portal is already up and running .
after all , nothing would be more fatal to the industry than to let all of the profit be swallowed up by google and co . there was also a lot of buzz in the run-up to the fair about the appearance of this year 's controversial guest country , china .
in the end , the official chinese organization committee struck a positive balance : their authors were welcomed and appeared satisfied with their closed-door agreement .
however , they repeated over and over again , like a mantra , that there was no censorship in china -lrb- but that authors may not break the law -rrb- . dialogue between the chinese delegation and the exiled authors and dissidents never took place - at least not in public .
more could and should have been done on this front if there had really been a desire .
the venue for the fair , which included two separate halls , spread widely apart , did n't exactly encourage discussion . the german media , however , engaged in a lively debate on the subject , which was one positive outcome of the book fair .
never before have we heard so much about china - its problems , objections , and taboo topics . argentina will be the guest country in 2010 , and that will surely be less touchy than this year .
as the largest book producer in latin america , it hopes to present its varied history and cultural diversity .
argentina hosts the most important book fair in latin america , and is an important partner of the frankfurt book fair . and then , hopefully , everybody will come again to frankfurt - because everybody comes to frankfurt . author : gabriela schaaf is dw 's literature expert -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the type of shot a person gets is to depend on their position in society , leading to complaints about a ' second class ' swine-flu vaccine .
politicians , certain government employees and members of the german military are scheduled to receive one type of the swine flu vaccine , while average citizens in germany are to receive a different one .
the difference between the two vaccines is that the one meant for members of the government is said to have fewer side-effects .
it also lacks certain additives which are said to be present in the version for the general population .
a spokesperson for the german interior minister , quoted by the berliner zeitung newspaper , said that the vaccines marked for the government were ordered months ago , when there were no clear differences between the two vaccines .
