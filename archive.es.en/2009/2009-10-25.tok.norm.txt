while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .

that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .

president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .

good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .

" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues .

beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .

the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .

" this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .

when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .

western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .

" we will take president obama at his word and enter talks with our allies so that the last of the nuclear weapons still stationed in germany , relics of the cold war , can finally be removed , " westerwelle said .
" germany must be free of nuclear weapons , " he said , adding that he would personally make efforts towards that purpose .
no unilateral move to remove nuclear arms his comments came a day after his fdp party reached agreement with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for a new center-right government scheduled to take office on october 28 .
the coalition agreement reached by the two sides calls specifically for talks with nato and the us to remove the weapons .

the us , which deployed nuclear weapons in various european countries in the 1950s , is estimated to have 20 atomic warheads in germany .
no official or publicly accessible information is available on where the weapons were stored .
but some of the missiles are believed to be stationed at the buechel airbase in the western german state of rhineland- palatinate .
controversial issue in germany westerwelle , 47 , has little direct foreign policy experience .
but the removal of us nuclear weapons from german soil is an issue he has regulary emphasized .
his fdp party is pro-american and has long campaigned for disarmament .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .
hamburg had looked to have survived the red card when marcus berg made it 3-2 for the visitors 10 minutes from time , but kuranyi rose at the far post in the 90th minute to draw the scores level once again .
bremen into third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marin bagged bremen 's second goal to give them the lead the result leaves bayer leverkusen , who were held 1-1 at home by borussia dortmund on friday , top of the table , level on 22 points with hamburg .
werder bremen meanwhile leapfrogged schalke into third place on 21 points after a 4-1 win at bochum .
the day got off to a horrendous start for bremen when thomas schaaf 's men conceded inside the first minute of play thanks to three intelligent touches from bochum striker stanislav sestak - the fastest goal this season .
but bremen fought back with goals from aaron hunt , marko marin , tim borowski and mesut oezil - two goals scored either side of halftime .
earlier sunday , bundesliga cellar dwellers hertha berlin earned their first league point since the opening day of the season when they held defending german champions wolfsburg to a goalless draw at home .
" that was a very important point for us , " said berlin captain arne friedrich .
" we are on the right path now , but we have to keep working and it was important to not concede any goals . "

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .

no unilateral move to remove nuclear arms his comments came a day after his fdp party reached agreement with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for a new center-right government scheduled to take office on october 28 .
the coalition agreement reached by the two sides calls specifically for talks with nato and the us to remove the weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants to make the removal of us nuclear arms a priority chancellor angela merkel confirmed this goal , but emphasized no unilateral action would be taken to remove the nuclear warheads .
" we do not want any independent action here , " merkel said on saturday in berlin .
the us , which deployed nuclear weapons in various european countries in the 1950s , is estimated to have 20 atomic warheads in germany .
no official or publicly accessible information is available on where the weapons were stored .
but some of the missiles are believed to be stationed at the buechel airbase in the western german state of rhineland- palatinate .
controversial issue in germany westerwelle , 47 , has little direct foreign policy experience .
but the removal of us nuclear weapons from german soil is an issue he has regulary emphasized .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .

"
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.10.2009 europe could pay the price for improved us-china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and china share broad economic interests since taking office president obama has worked hard to improve washington 's relationship with beijing .
while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .

western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 25.10.2009 iran voices doubts about nuclear deal as un inspectors arrive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmaker ali larijani warns of western " cheating " the us , russia and france are behind a deal brokered by the un on enriching iran 's uranium , but tehran is hesitating .
un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will take president obama at his word and enter talks with our allies so that the last of the nuclear weapons still stationed in germany , relics of the cold war , can finally be removed , " westerwelle said .
" germany must be free of nuclear weapons , " he said , adding that he would personally make efforts towards that purpose .
no unilateral move to remove nuclear arms his comments came a day after his fdp party reached agreement with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for a new center-right government scheduled to take office on october 28 .
the coalition agreement reached by the two sides calls specifically for talks with nato and the us to remove the weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants to make the removal of us nuclear arms a priority chancellor angela merkel confirmed this goal , but emphasized no unilateral action would be taken to remove the nuclear warheads .
" we do not want any independent action here , " merkel said on saturday in berlin .
the us , which deployed nuclear weapons in various european countries in the 1950s , is estimated to have 20 atomic warheads in germany .
no official or publicly accessible information is available on where the weapons were stored .
but some of the missiles are believed to be stationed at the buechel airbase in the western german state of rhineland- palatinate .
controversial issue in germany westerwelle , 47 , has little direct foreign policy experience .
but the removal of us nuclear weapons from german soil is an issue he has regulary emphasized .
his fdp party is pro-american and has long campaigned for disarmament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany regularly sees protests against us nuclear weapons in the country the nuclear issue , including nuclear power , is highly unpopular in germany , with shipments of nuclear waste regularly triggering angry protests .
the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .
the new german government recently agreed to reverse plans to abandon nuclear power .

the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .

midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .

" we will take president obama at his word and enter talks with our allies so that the last of the nuclear weapons still stationed in germany , relics of the cold war , can finally be removed , " westerwelle said .
" germany must be free of nuclear weapons , " he said , adding that he would personally make efforts towards that purpose .
no unilateral move to remove nuclear arms his comments came a day after his fdp party reached agreement with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for a new center-right government scheduled to take office on october 28 .
the coalition agreement reached by the two sides calls specifically for talks with nato and the us to remove the weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants to make the removal of us nuclear arms a priority chancellor angela merkel confirmed this goal , but emphasized no unilateral action would be taken to remove the nuclear warheads .
" we do not want any independent action here , " merkel said on saturday in berlin .
the us , which deployed nuclear weapons in various european countries in the 1950s , is estimated to have 20 atomic warheads in germany .
no official or publicly accessible information is available on where the weapons were stored .
but some of the missiles are believed to be stationed at the buechel airbase in the western german state of rhineland- palatinate .
controversial issue in germany westerwelle , 47 , has little direct foreign policy experience .
but the removal of us nuclear weapons from german soil is an issue he has regulary emphasized .
his fdp party is pro-american and has long campaigned for disarmament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.10.2009 europe could pay the price for improved us-china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and china share broad economic interests since taking office president obama has worked hard to improve washington 's relationship with beijing .
while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.10.2009 europe could pay the price for improved us-china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and china share broad economic interests since taking office president obama has worked hard to improve washington 's relationship with beijing .
while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .
hamburg had looked to have survived the red card when marcus berg made it 3-2 for the visitors 10 minutes from time , but kuranyi rose at the far post in the 90th minute to draw the scores level once again .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

" we will take president obama at his word and enter talks with our allies so that the last of the nuclear weapons still stationed in germany , relics of the cold war , can finally be removed , " westerwelle said .
" germany must be free of nuclear weapons , " he said , adding that he would personally make efforts towards that purpose .
no unilateral move to remove nuclear arms his comments came a day after his fdp party reached agreement with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for a new center-right government scheduled to take office on october 28 .

no official or publicly accessible information is available on where the weapons were stored .
but some of the missiles are believed to be stationed at the buechel airbase in the western german state of rhineland- palatinate .
controversial issue in germany westerwelle , 47 , has little direct foreign policy experience .
but the removal of us nuclear weapons from german soil is an issue he has regulary emphasized .
his fdp party is pro-american and has long campaigned for disarmament .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .
hamburg had looked to have survived the red card when marcus berg made it 3-2 for the visitors 10 minutes from time , but kuranyi rose at the far post in the 90th minute to draw the scores level once again .

werder bremen meanwhile leapfrogged schalke into third place on 21 points after a 4-1 win at bochum .
the day got off to a horrendous start for bremen when thomas schaaf 's men conceded inside the first minute of play thanks to three intelligent touches from bochum striker stanislav sestak - the fastest goal this season .
but bremen fought back with goals from aaron hunt , marko marin , tim borowski and mesut oezil - two goals scored either side of halftime .

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .
hamburg had looked to have survived the red card when marcus berg made it 3-2 for the visitors 10 minutes from time , but kuranyi rose at the far post in the 90th minute to draw the scores level once again .
bremen into third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marin bagged bremen 's second goal to give them the lead the result leaves bayer leverkusen , who were held 1-1 at home by borussia dortmund on friday , top of the table , level on 22 points with hamburg .
werder bremen meanwhile leapfrogged schalke into third place on 21 points after a 4-1 win at bochum .
the day got off to a horrendous start for bremen when thomas schaaf 's men conceded inside the first minute of play thanks to three intelligent touches from bochum striker stanislav sestak - the fastest goal this season .
but bremen fought back with goals from aaron hunt , marko marin , tim borowski and mesut oezil - two goals scored either side of halftime .
earlier sunday , bundesliga cellar dwellers hertha berlin earned their first league point since the opening day of the season when they held defending german champions wolfsburg to a goalless draw at home .

they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .

" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .

striker marcus berg opened the scoring for the visitors on 26 minutes after midfielder eljero elia darted down the flanks and into the penalty area before squaring , allowing the swede to drill his shot home from eight meters out .
the lead was doubled by piotr trochowski moments before halftime from a well taken free kick from 30 meters out .
trailing 2-0 at the break , schalke was first to strike through a kuranyi goal in the 50th minute bringing the score to 2-1 .
schalke 's odds improved substantially when hamburg defender david rozehnal earned a straight red for bringing down the former germany striker kuranyi whilst he was through on goal .
midfielder lukas schmitz headed home from the resulting free-kick to equalize for schalke on 62 minutes .
hamburg had looked to have survived the red card when marcus berg made it 3-2 for the visitors 10 minutes from time , but kuranyi rose at the far post in the 90th minute to draw the scores level once again .
bremen into third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marin bagged bremen 's second goal to give them the lead the result leaves bayer leverkusen , who were held 1-1 at home by borussia dortmund on friday , top of the table , level on 22 points with hamburg .
werder bremen meanwhile leapfrogged schalke into third place on 21 points after a 4-1 win at bochum .
the day got off to a horrendous start for bremen when thomas schaaf 's men conceded inside the first minute of play thanks to three intelligent touches from bochum striker stanislav sestak - the fastest goal this season .
but bremen fought back with goals from aaron hunt , marko marin , tim borowski and mesut oezil - two goals scored either side of halftime .
earlier sunday , bundesliga cellar dwellers hertha berlin earned their first league point since the opening day of the season when they held defending german champions wolfsburg to a goalless draw at home .
" that was a very important point for us , " said berlin captain arne friedrich .
" we are on the right path now , but we have to keep working and it was important to not concede any goals . "

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues .

" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .

"
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .

while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.10.2009 europe could pay the price for improved us-china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and china share broad economic interests since taking office president obama has worked hard to improve washington 's relationship with beijing .
while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

un inspectors have arrived in iran to examine a previously unknown nuclear site . while western powers have signed off on a deal that would produce nuclear fuel for tehran from its own partly enriched uranium , top iranian lawmakers are criticizing the deal saying that western powers are trying to take advantage of iran .
" they insist on going in a direction that speaks of cheating .
they are imposing some things on iran , " larijani told isna , the student news agency .
his comments echoed those of officials who suggested that instead of accepting the un draft proposal , iran should just buy nuclear fuel from abroad .
however , the deal in its present form is essentially what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad proposed nearly two months ago , saying the country needed 19.75-percent enriched uranium .
" we propose to buy it from anybody who is ready to sell it to us .
we are ready to give 3.5-percent enriched uranium and then they can enrich it more and deliver to us 19.75-percent enriched uranium , " said ahmadinejad on september 30 .
an october 1 meeting in geneva worked out the details of the arrangement that would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran .
inspectors arrive even as iran debates whether or not to accept the deal , four inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's nuclear watchdog , arrived in tehran on saturday night to inspect a controversial second uranium enrichment facility in qom whose existence iran revealed in september .
according to reports , the inspectors will spend three days in iran inspecting the facility located 65 miles south of tehran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran misses a deadline from iaea chief elbaradei the site was hidden by iran for three years until last month , increasing western suspicions about the country 's nuclear goals .
when the facility was revealed , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei criticized the iranians for what he said was a late disclosure of the site 's existence .
western diplomats and analysts have said the site 's capacity appears too small to fuel a nuclear power plant but big enough to yield material for one or two nuclear warheads a year .
missed deadline in meetings last week , elbaradei presented a proposal to all parties and imposed a deadline of october 23 to accept the deal .
the us , france and russia all agreed in principle to the arrangement but iran missed the deadline saying it would deliver its answer in a week .
since then , iranian media has run quotes from lawmakers who are questioning the wisdom of accepting the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear a nuclear iran one of them was from alaeddin borujerdi , the chairman of the iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee .
" it is better to buy 20 percent enriched fuel and keep the 3.5 percent for our domestic power plants ... than give to those countries , " he said .
borujerdi also warned iranians to be cautious in their dealings with world powers .
western powers are worried that iran 's low-enriched uranium , if not shipped out , may be further enhanced in tehran to weapons-grade material. av / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will take president obama at his word and enter talks with our allies so that the last of the nuclear weapons still stationed in germany , relics of the cold war , can finally be removed , " westerwelle said .
" germany must be free of nuclear weapons , " he said , adding that he would personally make efforts towards that purpose .
no unilateral move to remove nuclear arms his comments came a day after his fdp party reached agreement with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for a new center-right government scheduled to take office on october 28 .
the coalition agreement reached by the two sides calls specifically for talks with nato and the us to remove the weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants to make the removal of us nuclear arms a priority chancellor angela merkel confirmed this goal , but emphasized no unilateral action would be taken to remove the nuclear warheads .
" we do not want any independent action here , " merkel said on saturday in berlin .
the us , which deployed nuclear weapons in various european countries in the 1950s , is estimated to have 20 atomic warheads in germany .
no official or publicly accessible information is available on where the weapons were stored .
but some of the missiles are believed to be stationed at the buechel airbase in the western german state of rhineland- palatinate .
controversial issue in germany westerwelle , 47 , has little direct foreign policy experience .
but the removal of us nuclear weapons from german soil is an issue he has regulary emphasized .
his fdp party is pro-american and has long campaigned for disarmament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany regularly sees protests against us nuclear weapons in the country the nuclear issue , including nuclear power , is highly unpopular in germany , with shipments of nuclear waste regularly triggering angry protests .
the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 25.10.2009 europe could pay the price for improved us-china ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and china share broad economic interests since taking office president obama has worked hard to improve washington 's relationship with beijing .
while the us and china grow closer together , europe could find itself relegated to the sidelines . in a move that was n't widely reported , but probably did n't go unnoticed in beijing , president barack obama last month turned the authority to monitor and approve missile and technology sales to china from the white house to the commerce department .
while the administration says the change wo n't loosen the strict rules on military technology exports to beijing , non-proliferation experts noted the fact that the enforcement of export rules was turned over to the commerce department to promote us business interests instead of the pentagon or the state department .
earlier , obama 's decision not to meet the dalai lama before the president 's upcoming trip to china - the first presidential snub for tibet 's spiritual leader since 1991 - had made international news and triggered a debate about a possible shift of us-china policy .
another indicator of a new us approach was a statement by secretary of state hillary clinton that human rights issues were still part of us-china policy , but could n't ultimately damage the relationship .
a third aspect of a change in the white house 's human rights policy toward china are its dealings with rebiya kadeer and the world uighur congress .
" rebiya kadeer in previous administrations was having meetings with the president .
she has found it very difficult to get a similiar level of access , even to meet with a number of officials on lower levels in the administration and the chinese are aware of this too , " said andrew small , a china expert at the german marshall fund of the united states .
all these instances , adds small , constitute a clear change in human rights policy from earlier administrations .
that shift in focus by the new administration - less emphasis on human rights issues , more emphasis on trade and security issues - is reminiscent of a china approach favored by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during his tenure from 1998 to 2005 he repeatedly argued for overturning a eu weapons embargo against china , but his move was rejected at home by the green party , his coalition partner , and abroad by other eu member states .
president obama may prove to be more successful in altering us human rights policy toward china than chancellor schroeder was in his efforts to reframe the eu 's china policy .
still , argue experts , aside from human rights , washington 's approach toward beijing is very much a continuation of long-standing us foreign policy .
" there are significant elements of continuity with the bush policy on china , " said small .
good grades josef braml , a us expert with the german council on foreign relations , agreed : " i think there is a continuity of american foreign policy toward china which can be labeled ' congagement , ' a convergence of two diverting strategies - containment and engagement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has to wait until he can meet president bush 's successor .
relations between washington and beijing have improved under obama to an extent that even when the us slapped tariffs on chinese tires , the reaction from china was rather restrained .
" i think the chinese have treated some of these trade and economic issues with some degree of equanimity , partly because of the policy on issues such as the dalai lama and contacts with rabiya kadeer as well have been placatory to the chinese , " said small , adding that obama 's first year gets very good grades from beijing : " the chinese expect a lot tensions usually in the first year of a new administration and the fact that it has been restricted largely to some of these trade issues in what is in any case a difficult time for all sides on the trade issues - and the chinese themselves are not averse to some of these protectionist measures too - they see the overall tenor of this first year as very positive . "
what 's more , noted braml , both the us and china are basically forced to get along , because they simply are dependent on each other .
" if one wanted to describe it with a strategic metaphor , there is a new mad system - mutually assured destruction .
china could destroy america if it pulled the trigger in terms of financing us debt , but it would also hurt itself . "
with beijing holding approximately two billion dollars , mostly in government bonds , it is a major financier of us debt .
however , a quick disposal of those funds would seriously undermine the value of the us dollar and by extension the ability of american consumers to buy chinese products .
therefore both china and the us have an avid interest in good economic and political relations . while obama 's so called concept of " strategic reassurance " has been successful on the political and economic front at least for now and washington still hopes it will lead to improved chinese cooperation on iran and north korea , progress is more difficult on military issues . " this is an area where the blame that relations have not been improving on the military side lies very much with the chinese , " said small .
" there have been a number of efforts on the us side to improve crisis management mechanisms , to upgrade relations between the two militaries and the pushback comes from the chinese side . "
beijing still perceives washington to be militarily superior and thinks the us will gain more from better cooperation than china , he said .
he predicts future tensions between the us and china in the asia-pacific region until the chinese military changes its stance toward cooperation . euro-skeptic china despite the slow pace of improving military ties - something that the bush administration had also worked on - relations between two of the world 's major players have improved so much under obama that there have been concerns about the so-called g2 , the us and china , determining international policy with others left to follow .
" i do n't think so , " said braml , adding that there remain many issues were the us and china do n't see eye to eye and that europe is still a more reliable partner and known quantity for washington than china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's policy is increasingly focused on the us instead of europe small also does n't believe that the us or china can actually decide alone , but that unless there is an agreement between them , it is very hard to achieve a global deal on an issue .
" and if you look on the chinese side , there is a lot of what they would describe as euro-skepticism where the china-european relationship has got to and a sense that us-china relations are continuing to move in a very good direction and if anything are being upgraded with the new administration which has led them to become even more us-centric than they were before . "
the obama administration 's more pragmatic and multilateral approach to foreign policy places less of an emphasis on the traditional transatlantic relations than previous us governments .
" and that 's meant that countries like china in particular and russia are seeing quite a different environment and in some cases that is taking place at the expense of ties with europe , " said small .
" the standing of europe for the new administration you would have to say in the grand scheme of things is probably not as high as it was under bush . "

the case fueled anger against germany in the muslim world . the egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement issued on sunday that the government in cairo hired a team of senior german lawyers to defend the interests of the deceased woman 's family and to secure the maximum penalty allowed by german law .
the ministry said egypt had faith in the independence of the german legal system and its ability to ensure justice for the family of the deceased .
the trial began on monday in dresden in the same courthouse in which alex w. stabbed and killed 31-year-old marwa al-shirbini on july 1 this year .
alex w. , 28 , who was born in russia , stands accused of murder , attempted murder and dangerous bodily harm .
killing sparked protests in muslim world the man , classed by police as xenophobic , stabbed shirbini , a pharmacist , during an appeal hearing against a fine he was ordered to pay for verbally abusing the woman at a city playground in august 2008 .
shirbini , who at the time was pregnant with her second child , was in court with her husband and three-year-old son when the defendant lunged at her with a knife and stabbed her 18 times , killing her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shirbini 's murder caused a wave of anger in the muslim world her husband was also stabbed when he tried to intervene and and was critically wounded when a security guard called to the scene shot him in the leg , apparently confusing him for the attacker .
the killing triggered protests in shirbini 's native alexandria , egypt , where she was dubbed the " headscarf martyr . "
chancellor angela merkel expressed her condolences to egyptian president hosni mubarak on the sidelines of the group of eight summit in italy this summer , but german officials generally appeared slow to respond to the killing .
that was widely interpreted in the muslim world as evidence of a deep-rooted islamophobia in germany .
the incident also led to calls from iran for germany to be condemned by the united nations .
tight security at trial ahead of monday 's trial , security has been ramped up at the dresden court , where the july attack took place .
some 200 police officers will be deployed at the court and bulletproof glass has been installed in the courtroom police said there was " an abstract danger , " but had no concrete evidence an attack was planned on the defendant .
members of al-sherbini 's family , including her husband , elwy ali okaz , are to act as co-plantiffs in the trial , as is allowed under german law - allowing them to review evidence , file motions and question witnesses .
the trial is scheduled to last 11 days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a file photo of shirbini with her husband meanwhile , a police spokeswoman in dresden confirmed a report in news magazine der spiegel that the defendant , alex w. had received an internet death threat at the beginning of august by a person who identified himself as sheikh ihab adli abu al-majid .
the one-hour web broadcast included a call for muslims living in germany to kill the accused , a 28-year-old man identified as alex w. german orchestra cancels concerts meanwhile , a prominent german orchestra has cancelled two concerts in egypt due to security concerns related to the dresden trial .
the saxony state orchestra confirmed sunday it would not be playing in alexandria and cairo on october 31 and november 2 as planned .
a spokesperson for the orchestra , known as the saechsische staatskapelle in germany , and based in the city of dresden , said it was asked by egyptian authorities not to go ahead with the performances. rb / dpa / epd / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the forum of private business -lrb- fpb -rrb- says some councils are paying suppliers late on up to 30 % of occasions .
the welsh assembly government wants councils to pay bills in 30 days .
figures seen by the politics show wales show that no welsh local authority has a 100 % record of achieving that 30-day target .
local government minister brian gibbons encourages payment within 10 days .
phil mccabe from the fpb says the issue is " life or death " for small firms .
mr mccabe said : " our research consistently shows that late payment of invoices is the most significant problem for small firms .
" the impact of late payment is this : firms will close , they 'll be forced to because they ca n't maintain cash flow , which is the lifeblood of business of any kind . "
you have a firm in one part of wales who is able to survive because they 're getting paid on time and a similar firm elsewhere that has to close their doors simply because they 're not getting their invoices paid phil mccabe , forum of private business of the 18 authorities who responded to the freedom of information requests , monmouthshire was the worst performing , as 29 % of the time it failed to pay bills within 30 days .
swansea and flintshire also fared poorly , with around 20 % of payments missing the target .
the best performing authorities were pembrokeshire and bridgend , each hitting the target on 97 % of occasions .
swansea council said its performance was down to a transition to a new system of paying invoices .
" the result is considerably improved in 2009/10 and currently stands at 87 % paid within the deadline and rising , " a spokesperson said .
' prompt payment ' mr mccabe said the results showed that businesses were subject to a " postcode lottery " , which was both unfair and unsustainable .
" you have a firm in one part of wales who is able to survive because they 're getting paid on time and a similar firm elsewhere that has to close their doors simply because they 're not getting their invoices paid , " he said .
" late payment has always been a problem , now it 's a matter of life and death for many firms . "
but rhondda funeral director paul williams said he was impressed by the speed in which he received payments from his local authority , rhondda cynon taf .
we were concerned that there was an element of this as a gimmick when it was first announced ... but actually our experience in the past year has been that from that original 45 days the average payment time is now around 20 to 25 days bill mayne , facilities management company mms group " in all the years i 've done the contract , i 've always had a prompt payment .
once it 's all been clarified payment is made within the working month , " he said .
the issue of late payment emerged as a key theme in the assembly government 's economic summits , held over the past year .
it is seen as a crucial way in which government and local government can help keep money in small businesses and therefore keep them afloat .
in january , dr gibbons restructured the way local authorities are funded to encourage them to pay bills to their suppliers within 10 days .
' situation improved ' rhondda cynon taf is the best performing authority in this area , paying 64 % of bills within 10 days .
flintshire is the worst performing , with only 13 % of invoices settled within 10 days .
bill mayne , chief executive of facilities management company mms group , says the situation has improved since last year , where the average local authority payment to his company took around 45 days .
" we were concerned that there was an element of this as a gimmick when it was first announced , " he said .
" but actually our experience in the past year has been that from that original 45 days the average payment time is now around 20 to 25 days and the very best are now paying within 10 to 15 days . "
mr mccabe said the fpb would not be happy until all invoices were paid within the 30-day target .
" -lsb- local authorities -rsb- have come some way to setting the standard that the private sector should follow , but there 's still a way to go , " he said .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said : " the assembly government has always encouraged local government to pay its bills in a timely manner .
" encouraging faster supplier payments across the public sector is an important part of the welsh assembly government response to the current economic climate . "

advertisement scene of egypt train collision rescuers using heavy lifting equipment have untangled the wreckage of two passenger trains which crashed near cairo , killing at least 18 people .
officials said at least 50 people were also injured .
the trains collided at al-ayyat in giza , 50km -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south of the egyptian capital .
the accident happened when a train heading to fayoum stopped after apparently hitting an animal , and a second train went into the back of it .
the second train , destined for assiut in upper egypt , badly damaged its front carriages on impact , crushing the rear carriages of the train in front .
the military was brought in to help emergency services work through the night searching for bodies and injured passengers .
subsequent pictures from the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the two trains moved from the track by heavy lifting machinery .
' deafening screech ' eyewitnesses described how the first train made the unplanned stop after hitting an animal .
one eyewitness , named only as mohammed , said : " the train hit a water buffalo .
the gas pipeline broke , and the train stalled .
the other one came from behind quickly and hit it .
" the people at the doors all fell , and people fell beneath the train tread . "
resident , samhi saleh abdel al , told afp : " i was sat near the road ... when i heard a deafening screeching , then shouts and i saw passengers jumping from the train " .
egypt rail network has a long history of rail accidents .
the most deadly occurred at al-ayyat in 2002 , when a train fire left more than 370 people dead .
more recently , dozens were killed when a train crashed into vehicles at a level crossing north-west of cairo in july 2008 , and more than 50 died when two commuter trains collided near the capital in august 2006 .
