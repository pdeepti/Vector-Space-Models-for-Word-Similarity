the game at the ltu arena in dusseldorf was scoreless at halftime but leverkusen raced into a 3-0 lead after the break thanks to goals from tranquillo barnetta , arturo vidal and patrick helmes .
lucio and miroslav klose reduced the deficit to 3-2 with two goals in the space of three minutes but juergen klinsmann 's side could n't find the equalizer in the remaining 16 minutes and leverkusen made the game safe in added time with a goal from stefan kiessling .
" unfortunately , we have to forget about the cup but it wo n't help to have a go at the boys , " said klinsmann .
" something was missing for an hour and we have to digest that now . "
bayer coach bruno labbadia , meanwhile , said the victory was fully earned .
" we have a really young team with great potential , " he said .
" this win was an important step , not least in the minds of the players . "
bremen turn on the style to reach semis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg could n't overcome bremen five-time winners bremen raced into an early two-goal lead thanks goals in the first six minutes from midfielders diego and mesut ozil and although wolfsburg managed to restore parity , a brace from claudio pizarro ensured a comfortable win for thomas schaaf 's side .
diego showed brilliant technical skill to make it 1-0 after just three minutes and then helped set up the second by cleverly blocking his opponent to allow ozil to run through to score .
wolfsburg pulled one back on 10 minutes when edin dezko netted from close range and dezko leveled matters with his sixth goal in two cup games one minute before the break after bremen defender per mertesacker let him head home unchallenged .
however , diego restored bremen 's two goal lead with a penalty on 55 minutes before pizarro made the game safe on 71 minutes after being set up by substitute hugo almeida .
pizarro completed the rout with his second of the game a minute from time , although the referee did appear to ignore a raised flag by his assistant .
bremen have now won their last five cup games against wolfsburg .
" it was a great game , " said schaff .
" thank god we found our game again as when it was 2-0 we must have obviously thought that it would get a bit easier . "
hamburg survive nail-biting finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg survived a late scare before they could celebrate in the other match , hamburg looked to be cruising against wehen after a marko kopilas own goal on 17 minutes and a mladen petric strike on 37 gave martin jol 's side a 2-0 lead .
however , sandro schwarz made it 2-1 in the 85th minute , setting up a tense finish for the bundesliga side .
" i 'm happy that we are through , " said jol .

but germany has expressed reservations about gm 's request for european aid . the proposal for a mini-european summit from industry commissioner guenter verheugen came on the same day as gm 's auditors voiced " substantial doubt " about the parent company 's ability to stay afloat in its annual report . verheugen said thursday , march 5 , that he would like to see coordinated , european action on gm 's restructuring plans . " we need a common market not a purely national one , " he said .
" i would like to know what the various member states with gm sites are thinking of doing . " gm has said it is conducting talks for aid with the governments of all the european countries where it has factories , including germany .
in addition to opel 's activities in germany , where it has four plants , the company also has production sites in belgium , britain , poland and spain . belgium is particularly concerned that a bilateral deal between germany and gm could come at the cost of its opel factory in antwerp . the time is not right ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economics minister has reacted cautiously to proposed european talks but germany 's new economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said a european coordination summit would only make sense if gm revealed what exactly it is planning to do with its european factories and operations . " there are many issues that still have not been clarified , " guttenberg said the german government , who are still mulling opel 's request for 3.3 billion euros of financial help from european governments , also raised the pressure on opel 's management on thursday . finance minister peer steinbrueck said the restructuring plan submitted by the executives on monday did not provide an adequate basis for political decisions .
berlin has told opel that it needs time to carefully examine their business concept . german chancellor angela merkel has said that opel would not receive special treatment under the government 's industrial rescue plan .
berlin has provided cash and loan guarantees to a number of financial institutions that were deemed too big to be allowed to fail . dire warning from union leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of gm employees ' jobs are threatened in europe gm has over 55,000 employees in europe including 26,000 in germany .
a senior german union official has warned that the collapse of the opel unit would lead to the loss of around 400,000 jobs across europe as jobs at companies that supply opel would also be axed . armin schild , of the metalworkers ' union ig metall , told the daily berliner zeitung that the car and the auto supply sector would be equally hard hit . " the german government must support opel financially as a matter of urgency , " he told the newspaper .
" the consequences of a possible bankruptcy would be more expensive than the aid that opel needs , " he added . jg / sms / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .
the conference would be held in brussels on march 31 , dpa said . the secretary of state also told ministers that the us 's strategic review of its afghanistan mission would push for a stepping-up of efforts on the civilian side . it would also focus on " realistic and achievable " targets , such as preventing afghanistan from becoming a failed state or a safe haven for terrorists , rather than a western-style democracy , diplomats said . global security german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said support among nato members for a return to high-level ties with russia was overwhelming . " i think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in nato , and also , hopefully , a new atmosphere of cooperation , " he said .
" we will need both because our tasks will not get any easier . " the -lrb- georgia -rrb- crisis , which is now behind us militarily ... can not leave us in a situation where we refuse to talk , " said steinmeier , a long-time advocate of reconciliation with moscow . dfm / nda / th / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 05.03.2009 human rights groups call on berlin to set up permanent refugee scheme großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in some of the camps are very difficult four hundred iraqi refugees are set to land in germany later this month .
they are the first of a larger group that the eu has agreed to permanently resettle .
but german human rights groups are calling for more . human rights groups have welcomed the start of the program , but see it as just scratching the surface of the problem .
german organizations called on berlin to establish a permanent resettlement scheme .
the eu decided in november to take in 10,000 of the most vulnerable refugees who had fled war-torn iraq .
germany is set to receive 2,500 from camps in syria and iran .
other member states participating in the scheme are britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden .
priority was given to single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties in europe , according to the eu criteria .
successsful asylum applicants had to have a clean criminal record and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
way out for trapped refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees fear iraq is still too dangerous to go back or fear persecution guenter burkhardt from the organization pro asyl described the scheme as starting to offer a way out of a " dead-end " for people from religious minorities and others in need of protection from iraq .
but he added that far more than 2,500 people were in need of help , describing it as a drop in the ocean .
burkhardt said that an ongoing resettlement program should be set up in germany .
" there is room in germany , " he said .
" many of these people are educated .
our society needs people like them . "
julia duchrow , from amnesty international , expressed confidence that it would be possible to achieve a political consensus in germany in favor of a permanent annual scheme .
but she did not quantify the number of refugees that she would like to see taken in .
duchrow said priority should be given to people with relatives in germany , as that helped to promote their integration .
essential to integrate the new arrivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is a home to some 1.5 million iraqi refugees and says it ca n't cope the first group of 400 , including christians and members of other religious minorities , will initially be housed in northern germany , where they will be issued a three-year , extendable , residency permit .
" the arrival of the first people represents a success on our behalf , but we need to bear in mind that this is only the first phase of a long process , " duchrow , from amnesty international , told reporters .
burkhardt , from pro asly said it was essential to enable a " successful integration " of the group , adding that refugees are often forced to live on the periphery of society .
about two million iraqi refugees have fled to jordan and syria since the invasion of the country by us-led forces in march 2003 .
the federal office for refugees and migrants said iraqis accounted for around one third of asylum applications received since the start of 2009 .
the number of asylum applicants in germany has dropped dramatically in recent years .
while 1995 saw more than 500,000 people applying for asylum , the number reached just 20,000 in 2008 , according to government figures . jg / nda / afp / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 05.03.2009 clinton hopes to change tone with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton faces her first big diplomatic test russia is in the spotlight for nato countries and new us secretary of state hillary clinton .
the hope is that clinton 's meeting with the russians will signal start of a new era in trans-atlantic relations . clinton was given a red-carpet welcome at the european parliament on friday , march 6 , shaking hands with well-wishers and signing autographs .
clinton hopes to keep the good will going as she meets with top russian officials on friday evening .
it 's the first high-level meeting between the two countries since barack obama became president in january .
no major decisions are expected , but the obama administration has said it hopes to improve relations . on thursday , nato announced that it would resume the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , including at the ministerial level .
the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .

so , how do you fill the shoes of a legend ?
and how do you deal with criticism ? dw-tv : rigor , amor ...
michael rensing : .
misericordia .
what does that mean ?
what makes you ask that ?
i read it .
that 's the tatoo on my back , at the top .
i had it done four or five years ago .
i really wanted to get a tattoo .
but not one that was likely to lose it 's meaning .
that latin phrase stood out because firstly , i 'm very religious .
and secondly , because it is the name of a jesuit order in a book from paolo coelho - and i 've read all of his works .
i thought - my faith is something i will have for life and i will always represent .
it has meaning and it looks good too .
can you translate it ?
latin was my favourite subject at school .
rigor means strength - like rigourous .
amor is love and misericordia is mercy .
i think those words show a certain direction for how to live your life .
you also wanted to walk the way of st. james .
i 've actually done part of it already .
i went to a school run by monks , before i moved to munich .
just a few weeks before i came here , my whole school travelled to france and then went to santiago de compostella .
we took the bus occasionally , then walked and camped .
for two weeks michael rensing went on a pilgrimage , 800 kilometres long .
just like any other pilgrim .
that 's something that i like to look back on .
you get rid of all the superfluous things .
and you realise how unnecessary many things are .
then you find yourself , you think about your life and you become peaceful .
it 's a dream of mine , when i am finishing my football career and am still fit enough , to walk the entire route .
rensing first played in the bundesliga aged 19 .
at first he was only a substitute .
the prolonged career of olli kahn meant that rensing had to wait to get regular game time .
still , in four and a half years , rensing did n't lose a match .
you were a bit angry when karl-heinz rummenigge - bayern 's chairman - asked kahn to continue after the 2006 world cup .
i was n't enthusiastic about it , that 's for sure .
i was in good form and had played a few games that had gone well .
i would have liked to have been in goal .
so it was hard , but , it was somehow understandable .
olli defined an era and if he wanted to play on , then i had to accept it .
now i 'm the first choice goalkeeper , so , it worked out in the end .
when i look at your on-field presence you seem to consciously want to give the team a shake-up sometimes .
did you learn that from oliver kahn or is that just how you are ?
or did he change you a bit ?
no , not at all .
people are always saying i should n't copy olli kahn .
but i do think that our characters are similar .
i have also been able to learn a lot from him in the last years .
but i do n't just do something because someone else did it .
i do it because i 'm convinced of its effectiveness .
rensing still is n't at the level of kahn .
but he 's certainly got lots of talent .
but in germany at the moment young goalkeepers are often celebrated one day , then canned the next .
it does n't matter whether you are michael rensing , manuel neuer or rené adler .
how do you judge your career at the moment ?
who 's the country 's best goalkeeper ?
the media is always interested in bayern .
there always has to be something going on .
either everything is going great - is world class - or something has really gone wrong .
if someone in the national team squad makes a mistake then it is just discussed briefly and then the matter is finished .
regarding who is the best , well , i 'm not going to name anyone .
personally , ofcourse i would like to play for the german national team - it 's a topic people ask me about a lot .
but that is like concentrating on the third step before i 've completed the first steps .
i want to perform well here and keep improving .
if i do that , i 'll have an excellent chance of making the national team .
but at the moment i 'm not even thinking about it .
i 'm just concentrating on bayern and would like to my job here and win some titles .
the rest will just take care of itself . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

so , how do you fill the shoes of a legend ?
and how do you deal with criticism ? dw-tv : rigor , amor ...
michael rensing : .
misericordia .
what does that mean ?
what makes you ask that ?
i read it .
that 's the tatoo on my back , at the top .
i had it done four or five years ago .
i really wanted to get a tattoo .
but not one that was likely to lose it 's meaning .
that latin phrase stood out because firstly , i 'm very religious .
and secondly , because it is the name of a jesuit order in a book from paolo coelho - and i 've read all of his works .
i thought - my faith is something i will have for life and i will always represent .
it has meaning and it looks good too .
can you translate it ?
latin was my favourite subject at school .
rigor means strength - like rigourous .
amor is love and misericordia is mercy .
i think those words show a certain direction for how to live your life .
you also wanted to walk the way of st. james .
i 've actually done part of it already .
i went to a school run by monks , before i moved to munich .
just a few weeks before i came here , my whole school travelled to france and then went to santiago de compostella .
we took the bus occasionally , then walked and camped .
for two weeks michael rensing went on a pilgrimage , 800 kilometres long .
just like any other pilgrim .
that 's something that i like to look back on .
you get rid of all the superfluous things .
and you realise how unnecessary many things are .
then you find yourself , you think about your life and you become peaceful .
it 's a dream of mine , when i am finishing my football career and am still fit enough , to walk the entire route .
rensing first played in the bundesliga aged 19 .
at first he was only a substitute .
the prolonged career of olli kahn meant that rensing had to wait to get regular game time .
still , in four and a half years , rensing did n't lose a match .
you were a bit angry when karl-heinz rummenigge - bayern 's chairman - asked kahn to continue after the 2006 world cup .
i was n't enthusiastic about it , that 's for sure .
i was in good form and had played a few games that had gone well .
i would have liked to have been in goal .
so it was hard , but , it was somehow understandable .
olli defined an era and if he wanted to play on , then i had to accept it .
now i 'm the first choice goalkeeper , so , it worked out in the end .
when i look at your on-field presence you seem to consciously want to give the team a shake-up sometimes .
did you learn that from oliver kahn or is that just how you are ?
or did he change you a bit ?
no , not at all .
people are always saying i should n't copy olli kahn .
but i do think that our characters are similar .
i have also been able to learn a lot from him in the last years .
but i do n't just do something because someone else did it .
i do it because i 'm convinced of its effectiveness .
rensing still is n't at the level of kahn .
but he 's certainly got lots of talent .
but in germany at the moment young goalkeepers are often celebrated one day , then canned the next .
it does n't matter whether you are michael rensing , manuel neuer or rené adler .
how do you judge your career at the moment ?
who 's the country 's best goalkeeper ?
the media is always interested in bayern .
there always has to be something going on .
either everything is going great - is world class - or something has really gone wrong .
if someone in the national team squad makes a mistake then it is just discussed briefly and then the matter is finished .
regarding who is the best , well , i 'm not going to name anyone .
personally , ofcourse i would like to play for the german national team - it 's a topic people ask me about a lot .
but that is like concentrating on the third step before i 've completed the first steps .
i want to perform well here and keep improving .
if i do that , i 'll have an excellent chance of making the national team .
but at the moment i 'm not even thinking about it .
i 'm just concentrating on bayern and would like to my job here and win some titles .
the rest will just take care of itself . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

the alliance is also expected to reopen talks with russia . the meeting in brussels is the first by the united states ' new chief diplomat , who kicked off her maiden voyage to europe with a trans-atlantic dinner hosted by the belgian government on wednesday evening . thursday 's nato ministers ' meeting takes place as us president barack obama prepares to deploy 17,000 additional troops in afghanistan and is busy putting the finishing touches to its strategic review of the war against the taliban insurgency as the main contributor to nato 's operations in the country . however , senior us officials at nato said ahead of the meeting that clinton was also keen to " listen to our allies , to consult , to take part in an effort of building a strong consensus , a strong sense of solidarity and shared commitment . " obama 's election was warmly welcomed in europe , where hopes are high that he will bring new momentum to diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts around the world . clinton is expected to " underscore some of the emerging thoughts from the new administration about how we are looking at some of the challenges , " including afghanistan and eastern europe , us officials told the german dpa news agency . election in afghanistan nato 's main topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is considering troop levels ahead of afghan elections in august nato officials say much of thursday morning 's discussions will be devoted to the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan and its role in the aug .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .
a un-au mission currently has 15,179 total uniformed personnel in darfur , including 12,359 troops , 181 military observers , 2,639 police officers . dfm / nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the new proposals , companies ' supervisory boards would be obliged to cut managers ' salaries if the firm was performing badly . managers will also be required to retain their share options for four years instead of two .
this measure is intended to encourage executives to adopt a more sustainable , longer-term approach to their business .
in addition , angela merkel 's christian democrats and its junior governing partner , the social democrats , agreed that rises in managers ' pay must be determined by the entire supervisory board and not just a small coterie .
the coalition are to formulate further measures relating to managers in a working group over the coming weeks . disagreement on a number of matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the crisis , germany 's managerial class was embroiled in a number of scandals but the cdu rejected the spd 's call for curbs on executive pay .
the social democrats had wanted firms only to be able to write off salaries and redundancy payments against tax if they did not exceed a million euros .
the parties were also unable to reach agreement on the introduction of minimum pay for temps and a reform of the job centers for the unemployed . the conservatives parliamentary party leader volker kauder expressed disappointment with the outcome of the meeting in the chancellery .
" we have achieved something , but , of course , it could have been more , " he told germany 's public broadcaster ard .
peter ramsauer , from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , was more negative , describing the talks that went on into the early morning as the " hardest " and the " toughest " since the government took office three-and-a-half years ago . " this foreshadows the end of the coalition , " said ramsauer , alluding to the coalition 's increasing difficulty to reach compromise as the parties gear up for germany 's september elections .

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .
official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv europa on the spot -pipe- 05.03.2009 on the spot : michael rensing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rensing is the number one goalkeeper at bayern munich - taking over from oliver khan .
so , how do you fill the shoes of a legend ?
and how do you deal with criticism ? dw-tv : rigor , amor ...
michael rensing : .
misericordia .
what does that mean ?
what makes you ask that ?
i read it .
that 's the tatoo on my back , at the top .
i had it done four or five years ago .
i really wanted to get a tattoo .
but not one that was likely to lose it 's meaning .
that latin phrase stood out because firstly , i 'm very religious .
and secondly , because it is the name of a jesuit order in a book from paolo coelho - and i 've read all of his works .
i thought - my faith is something i will have for life and i will always represent .
it has meaning and it looks good too .
can you translate it ?
latin was my favourite subject at school .
rigor means strength - like rigourous .
amor is love and misericordia is mercy .
i think those words show a certain direction for how to live your life .
you also wanted to walk the way of st. james .
i 've actually done part of it already .
i went to a school run by monks , before i moved to munich .
just a few weeks before i came here , my whole school travelled to france and then went to santiago de compostella .
we took the bus occasionally , then walked and camped .
for two weeks michael rensing went on a pilgrimage , 800 kilometres long .
just like any other pilgrim .
that 's something that i like to look back on .
you get rid of all the superfluous things .
and you realise how unnecessary many things are .
then you find yourself , you think about your life and you become peaceful .
it 's a dream of mine , when i am finishing my football career and am still fit enough , to walk the entire route .
rensing first played in the bundesliga aged 19 .
at first he was only a substitute .
the prolonged career of olli kahn meant that rensing had to wait to get regular game time .
still , in four and a half years , rensing did n't lose a match .
you were a bit angry when karl-heinz rummenigge - bayern 's chairman - asked kahn to continue after the 2006 world cup .
i was n't enthusiastic about it , that 's for sure .
i was in good form and had played a few games that had gone well .
i would have liked to have been in goal .
so it was hard , but , it was somehow understandable .
olli defined an era and if he wanted to play on , then i had to accept it .
now i 'm the first choice goalkeeper , so , it worked out in the end .
when i look at your on-field presence you seem to consciously want to give the team a shake-up sometimes .
did you learn that from oliver kahn or is that just how you are ?
or did he change you a bit ?
no , not at all .
people are always saying i should n't copy olli kahn .
but i do think that our characters are similar .
i have also been able to learn a lot from him in the last years .
but i do n't just do something because someone else did it .
i do it because i 'm convinced of its effectiveness .
rensing still is n't at the level of kahn .
but he 's certainly got lots of talent .
but in germany at the moment young goalkeepers are often celebrated one day , then canned the next .

michael rensing : .
misericordia .
what does that mean ?
what makes you ask that ?
i read it .
that 's the tatoo on my back , at the top .
i had it done four or five years ago .
i really wanted to get a tattoo .
but not one that was likely to lose it 's meaning .
that latin phrase stood out because firstly , i 'm very religious .
and secondly , because it is the name of a jesuit order in a book from paolo coelho - and i 've read all of his works .
i thought - my faith is something i will have for life and i will always represent .
it has meaning and it looks good too .
can you translate it ?
latin was my favourite subject at school .
rigor means strength - like rigourous .
amor is love and misericordia is mercy .
i think those words show a certain direction for how to live your life .
you also wanted to walk the way of st. james .
i 've actually done part of it already .
i went to a school run by monks , before i moved to munich .
just a few weeks before i came here , my whole school travelled to france and then went to santiago de compostella .
we took the bus occasionally , then walked and camped .
for two weeks michael rensing went on a pilgrimage , 800 kilometres long .
just like any other pilgrim .
that 's something that i like to look back on .
you get rid of all the superfluous things .
and you realise how unnecessary many things are .
then you find yourself , you think about your life and you become peaceful .
it 's a dream of mine , when i am finishing my football career and am still fit enough , to walk the entire route .
rensing first played in the bundesliga aged 19 .
at first he was only a substitute .
the prolonged career of olli kahn meant that rensing had to wait to get regular game time .
still , in four and a half years , rensing did n't lose a match .
you were a bit angry when karl-heinz rummenigge - bayern 's chairman - asked kahn to continue after the 2006 world cup .
i was n't enthusiastic about it , that 's for sure .
i was in good form and had played a few games that had gone well .
i would have liked to have been in goal .
so it was hard , but , it was somehow understandable .
olli defined an era and if he wanted to play on , then i had to accept it .
now i 'm the first choice goalkeeper , so , it worked out in the end .
when i look at your on-field presence you seem to consciously want to give the team a shake-up sometimes .
did you learn that from oliver kahn or is that just how you are ?
or did he change you a bit ?
no , not at all .
people are always saying i should n't copy olli kahn .
but i do think that our characters are similar .
i have also been able to learn a lot from him in the last years .
but i do n't just do something because someone else did it .
i do it because i 'm convinced of its effectiveness .

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .
official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but germany has expressed reservations about gm 's request for european aid . the proposal for a mini-european summit from industry commissioner guenter verheugen came on the same day as gm 's auditors voiced " substantial doubt " about the parent company 's ability to stay afloat in its annual report . verheugen said thursday , march 5 , that he would like to see coordinated , european action on gm 's restructuring plans . " we need a common market not a purely national one , " he said .
" i would like to know what the various member states with gm sites are thinking of doing . " gm has said it is conducting talks for aid with the governments of all the european countries where it has factories , including germany .
in addition to opel 's activities in germany , where it has four plants , the company also has production sites in belgium , britain , poland and spain . belgium is particularly concerned that a bilateral deal between germany and gm could come at the cost of its opel factory in antwerp . the time is not right ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economics minister has reacted cautiously to proposed european talks but germany 's new economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said a european coordination summit would only make sense if gm revealed what exactly it is planning to do with its european factories and operations . " there are many issues that still have not been clarified , " guttenberg said the german government , who are still mulling opel 's request for 3.3 billion euros of financial help from european governments , also raised the pressure on opel 's management on thursday . finance minister peer steinbrueck said the restructuring plan submitted by the executives on monday did not provide an adequate basis for political decisions .
berlin has told opel that it needs time to carefully examine their business concept . german chancellor angela merkel has said that opel would not receive special treatment under the government 's industrial rescue plan .
berlin has provided cash and loan guarantees to a number of financial institutions that were deemed too big to be allowed to fail . dire warning from union leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of gm employees ' jobs are threatened in europe gm has over 55,000 employees in europe including 26,000 in germany .
a senior german union official has warned that the collapse of the opel unit would lead to the loss of around 400,000 jobs across europe as jobs at companies that supply opel would also be axed . armin schild , of the metalworkers ' union ig metall , told the daily berliner zeitung that the car and the auto supply sector would be equally hard hit . " the german government must support opel financially as a matter of urgency , " he told the newspaper .
" the consequences of a possible bankruptcy would be more expensive than the aid that opel needs , " he added . jg / sms / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opel threatens pay cuts , job losses for german workers in addition to the billions in government aid it says its needs , gm 's german subsidiary opel may have to cut up to 3,500 jobs to survive .
but governments are skeptical about investing in the troubled company .
-lrb- 04.03.2009 -rrb- opel 's future still uncertain as berlin mulls bailout deal the future of the troubled german carmaker opel remains unclear despite a top-level meeting between executives from the company and germany 's finance minister to discuss a request for several billion euros in state aid .

the game at the ltu arena in dusseldorf was scoreless at halftime but leverkusen raced into a 3-0 lead after the break thanks to goals from tranquillo barnetta , arturo vidal and patrick helmes .
lucio and miroslav klose reduced the deficit to 3-2 with two goals in the space of three minutes but juergen klinsmann 's side could n't find the equalizer in the remaining 16 minutes and leverkusen made the game safe in added time with a goal from stefan kiessling .
" unfortunately , we have to forget about the cup but it wo n't help to have a go at the boys , " said klinsmann .
" something was missing for an hour and we have to digest that now . "
bayer coach bruno labbadia , meanwhile , said the victory was fully earned .

bremen turn on the style to reach semis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg could n't overcome bremen five-time winners bremen raced into an early two-goal lead thanks goals in the first six minutes from midfielders diego and mesut ozil and although wolfsburg managed to restore parity , a brace from claudio pizarro ensured a comfortable win for thomas schaaf 's side .
diego showed brilliant technical skill to make it 1-0 after just three minutes and then helped set up the second by cleverly blocking his opponent to allow ozil to run through to score .
wolfsburg pulled one back on 10 minutes when edin dezko netted from close range and dezko leveled matters with his sixth goal in two cup games one minute before the break after bremen defender per mertesacker let him head home unchallenged .
however , diego restored bremen 's two goal lead with a penalty on 55 minutes before pizarro made the game safe on 71 minutes after being set up by substitute hugo almeida .
pizarro completed the rout with his second of the game a minute from time , although the referee did appear to ignore a raised flag by his assistant .
bremen have now won their last five cup games against wolfsburg .
" it was a great game , " said schaff .
" thank god we found our game again as when it was 2-0 we must have obviously thought that it would get a bit easier . "
hamburg survive nail-biting finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg survived a late scare before they could celebrate in the other match , hamburg looked to be cruising against wehen after a marko kopilas own goal on 17 minutes and a mladen petric strike on 37 gave martin jol 's side a 2-0 lead .

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world . " with the neues museum 's completion , only one institution on berlin 's museum island remains unfinished .
the altes nationalgalerie was renovated in 2001 and work on the bode museum was completed five years later .
the pergamon museum and the altes museum are due to be restored by 2026 . " the opening marks an important day for the museum island but also for berlin and the whole of germany , " hermann parzinger , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation which manages regional museums , told reporters . home to egyptian collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of nefertiti will receive a hall of its own in the museum the neues museum , which will open to the public in october , will house the archaeological collections of the capital 's egyptian museum including the 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti , which will have its own hall . " after 11 years , i 'm a little reluctant to hand over the keys today , " joked said british star architect david chipperfield , who won a competition to restore the building in 1997 . the island in the spree river is located in what used to be communist east germany and was not the subject of major renovation until the berlin wall fell 20 years ago .
the renovation of the island 's institutions has cost about 1 billion euros and the government is slated to spend another 500 million on related projects by 2025 . museum 's ' strange chronology ' unesco named the museum island a world cultural heritage site in 1999 and german officials have said that when completed the site will rival paris ' louvre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes visitors will flock to the newly completed museum the neues museum , which got its name because it was built shortly after the city 's old museum , is roughly rectangular , with high ceilings creating a light and airy atmosphere .
one of the building 's focal points is a grand staircase , which leads to the top floors and is a lasting monument to its first architect , friedrich august stueler . " the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following . " according to local media reports , berlin city authorities hope the completed museum island project will attract up to four million visitors a year . sms / afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the game at the ltu arena in dusseldorf was scoreless at halftime but leverkusen raced into a 3-0 lead after the break thanks to goals from tranquillo barnetta , arturo vidal and patrick helmes .
lucio and miroslav klose reduced the deficit to 3-2 with two goals in the space of three minutes but juergen klinsmann 's side could n't find the equalizer in the remaining 16 minutes and leverkusen made the game safe in added time with a goal from stefan kiessling .
" unfortunately , we have to forget about the cup but it wo n't help to have a go at the boys , " said klinsmann .
" something was missing for an hour and we have to digest that now . "
bayer coach bruno labbadia , meanwhile , said the victory was fully earned .
" we have a really young team with great potential , " he said .
" this win was an important step , not least in the minds of the players . "
bremen turn on the style to reach semis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg could n't overcome bremen five-time winners bremen raced into an early two-goal lead thanks goals in the first six minutes from midfielders diego and mesut ozil and although wolfsburg managed to restore parity , a brace from claudio pizarro ensured a comfortable win for thomas schaaf 's side .
diego showed brilliant technical skill to make it 1-0 after just three minutes and then helped set up the second by cleverly blocking his opponent to allow ozil to run through to score .
wolfsburg pulled one back on 10 minutes when edin dezko netted from close range and dezko leveled matters with his sixth goal in two cup games one minute before the break after bremen defender per mertesacker let him head home unchallenged .
however , diego restored bremen 's two goal lead with a penalty on 55 minutes before pizarro made the game safe on 71 minutes after being set up by substitute hugo almeida .
pizarro completed the rout with his second of the game a minute from time , although the referee did appear to ignore a raised flag by his assistant .
bremen have now won their last five cup games against wolfsburg .
" it was a great game , " said schaff .
" thank god we found our game again as when it was 2-0 we must have obviously thought that it would get a bit easier . "
hamburg survive nail-biting finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg survived a late scare before they could celebrate in the other match , hamburg looked to be cruising against wehen after a marko kopilas own goal on 17 minutes and a mladen petric strike on 37 gave martin jol 's side a 2-0 lead .
however , sandro schwarz made it 2-1 in the 85th minute , setting up a tense finish for the bundesliga side .

he said he could not say whether this might an act of revenge . " i am certain that we are going to clear up these accusations , " he told german tv news channel ntv . as the spd 's media expert , part of tauss ' job was to fight online child pornography . social democratic party heads said the accusations needed to be addressed calmly .

" until then we must presume that he is innocent . " tauss has been subject to unfounded accusations in the past .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .
a un-au mission currently has 15,179 total uniformed personnel in darfur , including 12,359 troops , 181 military observers , 2,639 police officers . dfm / nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the new proposals , companies ' supervisory boards would be obliged to cut managers ' salaries if the firm was performing badly . managers will also be required to retain their share options for four years instead of two .
this measure is intended to encourage executives to adopt a more sustainable , longer-term approach to their business .
in addition , angela merkel 's christian democrats and its junior governing partner , the social democrats , agreed that rises in managers ' pay must be determined by the entire supervisory board and not just a small coterie .
the coalition are to formulate further measures relating to managers in a working group over the coming weeks . disagreement on a number of matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the crisis , germany 's managerial class was embroiled in a number of scandals but the cdu rejected the spd 's call for curbs on executive pay .
the social democrats had wanted firms only to be able to write off salaries and redundancy payments against tax if they did not exceed a million euros .
the parties were also unable to reach agreement on the introduction of minimum pay for temps and a reform of the job centers for the unemployed . the conservatives parliamentary party leader volker kauder expressed disappointment with the outcome of the meeting in the chancellery .
" we have achieved something , but , of course , it could have been more , " he told germany 's public broadcaster ard .
peter ramsauer , from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , was more negative , describing the talks that went on into the early morning as the " hardest " and the " toughest " since the government took office three-and-a-half years ago . " this foreshadows the end of the coalition , " said ramsauer , alluding to the coalition 's increasing difficulty to reach compromise as the parties gear up for germany 's september elections .

but spd parliamentary party leader peter struck dismissed ramsauer 's comments as " nonsense " , saying he had experienced " tougher " talks .
" we have to work hard that 's why we are elected , " he said .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck also struck a positive note , saying that the coalition had made progress in achieving such a broad consensus on financial matters .
" these are very pleasing results to come out of the coalition committee meeting , " he stressed on thursday .

the alliance is also expected to reopen talks with russia . the meeting in brussels is the first by the united states ' new chief diplomat , who kicked off her maiden voyage to europe with a trans-atlantic dinner hosted by the belgian government on wednesday evening . thursday 's nato ministers ' meeting takes place as us president barack obama prepares to deploy 17,000 additional troops in afghanistan and is busy putting the finishing touches to its strategic review of the war against the taliban insurgency as the main contributor to nato 's operations in the country . however , senior us officials at nato said ahead of the meeting that clinton was also keen to " listen to our allies , to consult , to take part in an effort of building a strong consensus , a strong sense of solidarity and shared commitment . " obama 's election was warmly welcomed in europe , where hopes are high that he will bring new momentum to diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts around the world . clinton is expected to " underscore some of the emerging thoughts from the new administration about how we are looking at some of the challenges , " including afghanistan and eastern europe , us officials told the german dpa news agency . election in afghanistan nato 's main topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is considering troop levels ahead of afghan elections in august nato officials say much of thursday morning 's discussions will be devoted to the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan and its role in the aug .

the alliance 's commanders have called for the deployment of four additional battalions in the country 's south , north and west to protect voters from possible taliban attacks during the election . nato officials also welcomed a decision by the country 's independent election committee on wednesday not to bring forward the poll , as had been requested by afghan president hamid karzai , saying it would give the alliance the time needed to boost its security measures . but signs of warming relations between washington and brussels are also evident in foreign ministers ' likely decision to resume direct talks with russia . re-establishing direct talks with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official talks between russia and nato are likely to restart the main forum for such talks , the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , was suspended by the alliance in the aftermath of the russia-georgia war in august and moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . but there is now a growing consensus within the 26-member alliance that such meetings should resume . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who plans to brief ministers about his recent talks with russian officials , " hopes that tomorrow 's meeting will lead to a decision to re-engage in the nrc , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . " there are clear areas where nato and russia need to engage more fully - on afghanistan , terrorism and in other areas , " appathurai reporters , adding that a formal ambassadorial level meeting of the nato-russia council could happen " very , very quickly . " at the same time , the resumption of nrc meetings would " in no way diminish " nato 's condemnation of the august conflict and russia 's plans to build up its military presence in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , appathurai said . missile defense differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato meeting is part of clinton 's first trip to europe as secretary of state despite the nrc freeze , nato and russia are already actively cooperating in several areas , including in afghanistan and on international counter-piracy missions . tension between moscow and washington has also been eased by obama 's suggestion this week that preventing iran from developing a nuclear weapon would diminish the need for the united states to base a missile-defense system in eastern europe . plans by former us president george w. bush to place 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic had drawn strong criticisms from russian president dmitry medvedev , with moscow viewing the deployment as a threat to its own strategic nuclear deterrent . thursday 's is the last high-level nato meeting before the alliance celebrates its 60th birthday at a summit in strasbourg and its german suburb of kehl on april 3-4 . sms / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world . " with the neues museum 's completion , only one institution on berlin 's museum island remains unfinished .
the altes nationalgalerie was renovated in 2001 and work on the bode museum was completed five years later .
the pergamon museum and the altes museum are due to be restored by 2026 .

" after 11 years , i 'm a little reluctant to hand over the keys today , " joked said british star architect david chipperfield , who won a competition to restore the building in 1997 . the island in the spree river is located in what used to be communist east germany and was not the subject of major renovation until the berlin wall fell 20 years ago .
the renovation of the island 's institutions has cost about 1 billion euros and the government is slated to spend another 500 million on related projects by 2025 . museum 's ' strange chronology ' unesco named the museum island a world cultural heritage site in 1999 and german officials have said that when completed the site will rival paris ' louvre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes visitors will flock to the newly completed museum the neues museum , which got its name because it was built shortly after the city 's old museum , is roughly rectangular , with high ceilings creating a light and airy atmosphere .
one of the building 's focal points is a grand staircase , which leads to the top floors and is a lasting monument to its first architect , friedrich august stueler . " the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following .

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world . " with the neues museum 's completion , only one institution on berlin 's museum island remains unfinished .
the altes nationalgalerie was renovated in 2001 and work on the bode museum was completed five years later .
the pergamon museum and the altes museum are due to be restored by 2026 . " the opening marks an important day for the museum island but also for berlin and the whole of germany , " hermann parzinger , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation which manages regional museums , told reporters . home to egyptian collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of nefertiti will receive a hall of its own in the museum the neues museum , which will open to the public in october , will house the archaeological collections of the capital 's egyptian museum including the 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti , which will have its own hall . " after 11 years , i 'm a little reluctant to hand over the keys today , " joked said british star architect david chipperfield , who won a competition to restore the building in 1997 . the island in the spree river is located in what used to be communist east germany and was not the subject of major renovation until the berlin wall fell 20 years ago .
the renovation of the island 's institutions has cost about 1 billion euros and the government is slated to spend another 500 million on related projects by 2025 . museum 's ' strange chronology ' unesco named the museum island a world cultural heritage site in 1999 and german officials have said that when completed the site will rival paris ' louvre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes visitors will flock to the newly completed museum the neues museum , which got its name because it was built shortly after the city 's old museum , is roughly rectangular , with high ceilings creating a light and airy atmosphere .
one of the building 's focal points is a grand staircase , which leads to the top floors and is a lasting monument to its first architect , friedrich august stueler . " the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following . " according to local media reports , berlin city authorities hope the completed museum island project will attract up to four million visitors a year . sms / afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .

under the new proposals , companies ' supervisory boards would be obliged to cut managers ' salaries if the firm was performing badly . managers will also be required to retain their share options for four years instead of two .
this measure is intended to encourage executives to adopt a more sustainable , longer-term approach to their business .
in addition , angela merkel 's christian democrats and its junior governing partner , the social democrats , agreed that rises in managers ' pay must be determined by the entire supervisory board and not just a small coterie .
the coalition are to formulate further measures relating to managers in a working group over the coming weeks . disagreement on a number of matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the crisis , germany 's managerial class was embroiled in a number of scandals but the cdu rejected the spd 's call for curbs on executive pay .
the social democrats had wanted firms only to be able to write off salaries and redundancy payments against tax if they did not exceed a million euros .
the parties were also unable to reach agreement on the introduction of minimum pay for temps and a reform of the job centers for the unemployed . the conservatives parliamentary party leader volker kauder expressed disappointment with the outcome of the meeting in the chancellery .
" we have achieved something , but , of course , it could have been more , " he told germany 's public broadcaster ard .
peter ramsauer , from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , was more negative , describing the talks that went on into the early morning as the " hardest " and the " toughest " since the government took office three-and-a-half years ago . " this foreshadows the end of the coalition , " said ramsauer , alluding to the coalition 's increasing difficulty to reach compromise as the parties gear up for germany 's september elections .
election ?

under the new proposals , companies ' supervisory boards would be obliged to cut managers ' salaries if the firm was performing badly . managers will also be required to retain their share options for four years instead of two .
this measure is intended to encourage executives to adopt a more sustainable , longer-term approach to their business .
in addition , angela merkel 's christian democrats and its junior governing partner , the social democrats , agreed that rises in managers ' pay must be determined by the entire supervisory board and not just a small coterie .
the coalition are to formulate further measures relating to managers in a working group over the coming weeks . disagreement on a number of matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the crisis , germany 's managerial class was embroiled in a number of scandals but the cdu rejected the spd 's call for curbs on executive pay .
the social democrats had wanted firms only to be able to write off salaries and redundancy payments against tax if they did not exceed a million euros .
the parties were also unable to reach agreement on the introduction of minimum pay for temps and a reform of the job centers for the unemployed . the conservatives parliamentary party leader volker kauder expressed disappointment with the outcome of the meeting in the chancellery .
" we have achieved something , but , of course , it could have been more , " he told germany 's public broadcaster ard .
peter ramsauer , from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , was more negative , describing the talks that went on into the early morning as the " hardest " and the " toughest " since the government took office three-and-a-half years ago . " this foreshadows the end of the coalition , " said ramsauer , alluding to the coalition 's increasing difficulty to reach compromise as the parties gear up for germany 's september elections .
election ?
what election ?
but spd parliamentary party leader peter struck dismissed ramsauer 's comments as " nonsense " , saying he had experienced " tougher " talks .
" we have to work hard that 's why we are elected , " he said .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck also struck a positive note , saying that the coalition had made progress in achieving such a broad consensus on financial matters .
" these are very pleasing results to come out of the coalition committee meeting , " he stressed on thursday .
other measures agreed at the meeting included the introduction of a number of regulations relating to environmental matters .

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .
official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .
official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world . " with the neues museum 's completion , only one institution on berlin 's museum island remains unfinished .
the altes nationalgalerie was renovated in 2001 and work on the bode museum was completed five years later .
the pergamon museum and the altes museum are due to be restored by 2026 . " the opening marks an important day for the museum island but also for berlin and the whole of germany , " hermann parzinger , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation which manages regional museums , told reporters . home to egyptian collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of nefertiti will receive a hall of its own in the museum the neues museum , which will open to the public in october , will house the archaeological collections of the capital 's egyptian museum including the 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti , which will have its own hall . " after 11 years , i 'm a little reluctant to hand over the keys today , " joked said british star architect david chipperfield , who won a competition to restore the building in 1997 . the island in the spree river is located in what used to be communist east germany and was not the subject of major renovation until the berlin wall fell 20 years ago .
the renovation of the island 's institutions has cost about 1 billion euros and the government is slated to spend another 500 million on related projects by 2025 . museum 's ' strange chronology ' unesco named the museum island a world cultural heritage site in 1999 and german officials have said that when completed the site will rival paris ' louvre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes visitors will flock to the newly completed museum the neues museum , which got its name because it was built shortly after the city 's old museum , is roughly rectangular , with high ceilings creating a light and airy atmosphere .
one of the building 's focal points is a grand staircase , which leads to the top floors and is a lasting monument to its first architect , friedrich august stueler . " the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following .

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory .

" after 11 years , i 'm a little reluctant to hand over the keys today , " joked said british star architect david chipperfield , who won a competition to restore the building in 1997 . the island in the spree river is located in what used to be communist east germany and was not the subject of major renovation until the berlin wall fell 20 years ago .
the renovation of the island 's institutions has cost about 1 billion euros and the government is slated to spend another 500 million on related projects by 2025 . museum 's ' strange chronology ' unesco named the museum island a world cultural heritage site in 1999 and german officials have said that when completed the site will rival paris ' louvre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes visitors will flock to the newly completed museum the neues museum , which got its name because it was built shortly after the city 's old museum , is roughly rectangular , with high ceilings creating a light and airy atmosphere .
one of the building 's focal points is a grand staircase , which leads to the top floors and is a lasting monument to its first architect , friedrich august stueler . " the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following . " according to local media reports , berlin city authorities hope the completed museum island project will attract up to four million visitors a year . sms / afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.03.2009 world divided on icc arrest warrant for sudan 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's president omar al-bashir has so-far disregarded the icc warrant reactions from world leaders and officials were mixed wednesday as the international criminal court announced an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity . western nations and human rights groups broadly backed the decision , calling for cooperation from the sudanese government .
while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .

in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .

the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

under the new proposals , companies ' supervisory boards would be obliged to cut managers ' salaries if the firm was performing badly . managers will also be required to retain their share options for four years instead of two .
this measure is intended to encourage executives to adopt a more sustainable , longer-term approach to their business .
in addition , angela merkel 's christian democrats and its junior governing partner , the social democrats , agreed that rises in managers ' pay must be determined by the entire supervisory board and not just a small coterie .
the coalition are to formulate further measures relating to managers in a working group over the coming weeks . disagreement on a number of matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the crisis , germany 's managerial class was embroiled in a number of scandals but the cdu rejected the spd 's call for curbs on executive pay .
the social democrats had wanted firms only to be able to write off salaries and redundancy payments against tax if they did not exceed a million euros .
the parties were also unable to reach agreement on the introduction of minimum pay for temps and a reform of the job centers for the unemployed . the conservatives parliamentary party leader volker kauder expressed disappointment with the outcome of the meeting in the chancellery .
" we have achieved something , but , of course , it could have been more , " he told germany 's public broadcaster ard .
peter ramsauer , from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , was more negative , describing the talks that went on into the early morning as the " hardest " and the " toughest " since the government took office three-and-a-half years ago . " this foreshadows the end of the coalition , " said ramsauer , alluding to the coalition 's increasing difficulty to reach compromise as the parties gear up for germany 's september elections .
election ?
what election ?
but spd parliamentary party leader peter struck dismissed ramsauer 's comments as " nonsense " , saying he had experienced " tougher " talks .
" we have to work hard that 's why we are elected , " he said .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck also struck a positive note , saying that the coalition had made progress in achieving such a broad consensus on financial matters .
" these are very pleasing results to come out of the coalition committee meeting , " he stressed on thursday .
other measures agreed at the meeting included the introduction of a number of regulations relating to environmental matters .

the alliance is also expected to reopen talks with russia . the meeting in brussels is the first by the united states ' new chief diplomat , who kicked off her maiden voyage to europe with a trans-atlantic dinner hosted by the belgian government on wednesday evening . thursday 's nato ministers ' meeting takes place as us president barack obama prepares to deploy 17,000 additional troops in afghanistan and is busy putting the finishing touches to its strategic review of the war against the taliban insurgency as the main contributor to nato 's operations in the country . however , senior us officials at nato said ahead of the meeting that clinton was also keen to " listen to our allies , to consult , to take part in an effort of building a strong consensus , a strong sense of solidarity and shared commitment . " obama 's election was warmly welcomed in europe , where hopes are high that he will bring new momentum to diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts around the world . clinton is expected to " underscore some of the emerging thoughts from the new administration about how we are looking at some of the challenges , " including afghanistan and eastern europe , us officials told the german dpa news agency . election in afghanistan nato 's main topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is considering troop levels ahead of afghan elections in august nato officials say much of thursday morning 's discussions will be devoted to the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan and its role in the aug .

the alliance 's commanders have called for the deployment of four additional battalions in the country 's south , north and west to protect voters from possible taliban attacks during the election . nato officials also welcomed a decision by the country 's independent election committee on wednesday not to bring forward the poll , as had been requested by afghan president hamid karzai , saying it would give the alliance the time needed to boost its security measures . but signs of warming relations between washington and brussels are also evident in foreign ministers ' likely decision to resume direct talks with russia . re-establishing direct talks with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official talks between russia and nato are likely to restart the main forum for such talks , the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , was suspended by the alliance in the aftermath of the russia-georgia war in august and moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . but there is now a growing consensus within the 26-member alliance that such meetings should resume . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who plans to brief ministers about his recent talks with russian officials , " hopes that tomorrow 's meeting will lead to a decision to re-engage in the nrc , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . " there are clear areas where nato and russia need to engage more fully - on afghanistan , terrorism and in other areas , " appathurai reporters , adding that a formal ambassadorial level meeting of the nato-russia council could happen " very , very quickly . " at the same time , the resumption of nrc meetings would " in no way diminish " nato 's condemnation of the august conflict and russia 's plans to build up its military presence in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , appathurai said . missile defense differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato meeting is part of clinton 's first trip to europe as secretary of state despite the nrc freeze , nato and russia are already actively cooperating in several areas , including in afghanistan and on international counter-piracy missions . tension between moscow and washington has also been eased by obama 's suggestion this week that preventing iran from developing a nuclear weapon would diminish the need for the united states to base a missile-defense system in eastern europe . plans by former us president george w. bush to place 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic had drawn strong criticisms from russian president dmitry medvedev , with moscow viewing the deployment as a threat to its own strategic nuclear deterrent . thursday 's is the last high-level nato meeting before the alliance celebrates its 60th birthday at a summit in strasbourg and its german suburb of kehl on april 3-4 . sms / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the game at the ltu arena in dusseldorf was scoreless at halftime but leverkusen raced into a 3-0 lead after the break thanks to goals from tranquillo barnetta , arturo vidal and patrick helmes .
lucio and miroslav klose reduced the deficit to 3-2 with two goals in the space of three minutes but juergen klinsmann 's side could n't find the equalizer in the remaining 16 minutes and leverkusen made the game safe in added time with a goal from stefan kiessling .
" unfortunately , we have to forget about the cup but it wo n't help to have a go at the boys , " said klinsmann .
" something was missing for an hour and we have to digest that now . "

diego showed brilliant technical skill to make it 1-0 after just three minutes and then helped set up the second by cleverly blocking his opponent to allow ozil to run through to score .
wolfsburg pulled one back on 10 minutes when edin dezko netted from close range and dezko leveled matters with his sixth goal in two cup games one minute before the break after bremen defender per mertesacker let him head home unchallenged .
however , diego restored bremen 's two goal lead with a penalty on 55 minutes before pizarro made the game safe on 71 minutes after being set up by substitute hugo almeida .
pizarro completed the rout with his second of the game a minute from time , although the referee did appear to ignore a raised flag by his assistant .

the alliance is also expected to reopen talks with russia . the meeting in brussels is the first by the united states ' new chief diplomat , who kicked off her maiden voyage to europe with a trans-atlantic dinner hosted by the belgian government on wednesday evening . thursday 's nato ministers ' meeting takes place as us president barack obama prepares to deploy 17,000 additional troops in afghanistan and is busy putting the finishing touches to its strategic review of the war against the taliban insurgency as the main contributor to nato 's operations in the country . however , senior us officials at nato said ahead of the meeting that clinton was also keen to " listen to our allies , to consult , to take part in an effort of building a strong consensus , a strong sense of solidarity and shared commitment . " obama 's election was warmly welcomed in europe , where hopes are high that he will bring new momentum to diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts around the world . clinton is expected to " underscore some of the emerging thoughts from the new administration about how we are looking at some of the challenges , " including afghanistan and eastern europe , us officials told the german dpa news agency . election in afghanistan nato 's main topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is considering troop levels ahead of afghan elections in august nato officials say much of thursday morning 's discussions will be devoted to the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan and its role in the aug .
20 presidential and provincial elections .
the alliance 's commanders have called for the deployment of four additional battalions in the country 's south , north and west to protect voters from possible taliban attacks during the election . nato officials also welcomed a decision by the country 's independent election committee on wednesday not to bring forward the poll , as had been requested by afghan president hamid karzai , saying it would give the alliance the time needed to boost its security measures . but signs of warming relations between washington and brussels are also evident in foreign ministers ' likely decision to resume direct talks with russia . re-establishing direct talks with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official talks between russia and nato are likely to restart the main forum for such talks , the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , was suspended by the alliance in the aftermath of the russia-georgia war in august and moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . but there is now a growing consensus within the 26-member alliance that such meetings should resume . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who plans to brief ministers about his recent talks with russian officials , " hopes that tomorrow 's meeting will lead to a decision to re-engage in the nrc , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . " there are clear areas where nato and russia need to engage more fully - on afghanistan , terrorism and in other areas , " appathurai reporters , adding that a formal ambassadorial level meeting of the nato-russia council could happen " very , very quickly . " at the same time , the resumption of nrc meetings would " in no way diminish " nato 's condemnation of the august conflict and russia 's plans to build up its military presence in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , appathurai said . missile defense differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato meeting is part of clinton 's first trip to europe as secretary of state despite the nrc freeze , nato and russia are already actively cooperating in several areas , including in afghanistan and on international counter-piracy missions . tension between moscow and washington has also been eased by obama 's suggestion this week that preventing iran from developing a nuclear weapon would diminish the need for the united states to base a missile-defense system in eastern europe . plans by former us president george w. bush to place 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic had drawn strong criticisms from russian president dmitry medvedev , with moscow viewing the deployment as a threat to its own strategic nuclear deterrent . thursday 's is the last high-level nato meeting before the alliance celebrates its 60th birthday at a summit in strasbourg and its german suburb of kehl on april 3-4 . sms / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hope is that clinton 's meeting with the russians will signal start of a new era in trans-atlantic relations . clinton was given a red-carpet welcome at the european parliament on friday , march 6 , shaking hands with well-wishers and signing autographs .
clinton hopes to keep the good will going as she meets with top russian officials on friday evening .
it 's the first high-level meeting between the two countries since barack obama became president in january .
no major decisions are expected , but the obama administration has said it hopes to improve relations . on thursday , nato announced that it would resume the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , including at the ministerial level .
the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .
the conference would be held in brussels on march 31 , dpa said . the secretary of state also told ministers that the us 's strategic review of its afghanistan mission would push for a stepping-up of efforts on the civilian side . it would also focus on " realistic and achievable " targets , such as preventing afghanistan from becoming a failed state or a safe haven for terrorists , rather than a western-style democracy , diplomats said . global security german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said support among nato members for a return to high-level ties with russia was overwhelming . " i think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in nato , and also , hopefully , a new atmosphere of cooperation , " he said .
" we will need both because our tasks will not get any easier . " the -lrb- georgia -rrb- crisis , which is now behind us militarily ... can not leave us in a situation where we refuse to talk , " said steinmeier , a long-time advocate of reconciliation with moscow . dfm / nda / th / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .
official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 05.03.2009 human rights groups call on berlin to set up permanent refugee scheme großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in some of the camps are very difficult four hundred iraqi refugees are set to land in germany later this month .
they are the first of a larger group that the eu has agreed to permanently resettle .
but german human rights groups are calling for more . human rights groups have welcomed the start of the program , but see it as just scratching the surface of the problem .
german organizations called on berlin to establish a permanent resettlement scheme .
the eu decided in november to take in 10,000 of the most vulnerable refugees who had fled war-torn iraq .
germany is set to receive 2,500 from camps in syria and iran .
other member states participating in the scheme are britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden .
priority was given to single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties in europe , according to the eu criteria .
successsful asylum applicants had to have a clean criminal record and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
way out for trapped refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees fear iraq is still too dangerous to go back or fear persecution guenter burkhardt from the organization pro asyl described the scheme as starting to offer a way out of a " dead-end " for people from religious minorities and others in need of protection from iraq .
but he added that far more than 2,500 people were in need of help , describing it as a drop in the ocean .
burkhardt said that an ongoing resettlement program should be set up in germany .
" there is room in germany , " he said .
" many of these people are educated .
our society needs people like them . "
julia duchrow , from amnesty international , expressed confidence that it would be possible to achieve a political consensus in germany in favor of a permanent annual scheme .
but she did not quantify the number of refugees that she would like to see taken in .
duchrow said priority should be given to people with relatives in germany , as that helped to promote their integration .
essential to integrate the new arrivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is a home to some 1.5 million iraqi refugees and says it ca n't cope the first group of 400 , including christians and members of other religious minorities , will initially be housed in northern germany , where they will be issued a three-year , extendable , residency permit .
" the arrival of the first people represents a success on our behalf , but we need to bear in mind that this is only the first phase of a long process , " duchrow , from amnesty international , told reporters .
burkhardt , from pro asly said it was essential to enable a " successful integration " of the group , adding that refugees are often forced to live on the periphery of society .
about two million iraqi refugees have fled to jordan and syria since the invasion of the country by us-led forces in march 2003 .
the federal office for refugees and migrants said iraqis accounted for around one third of asylum applications received since the start of 2009 .
the number of asylum applicants in germany has dropped dramatically in recent years .
while 1995 saw more than 500,000 people applying for asylum , the number reached just 20,000 in 2008 , according to government figures . jg / nda / afp / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is set to receive 2,500 from camps in syria and iran .
other member states participating in the scheme are britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden .

under the new proposals , companies ' supervisory boards would be obliged to cut managers ' salaries if the firm was performing badly . managers will also be required to retain their share options for four years instead of two .
this measure is intended to encourage executives to adopt a more sustainable , longer-term approach to their business .
in addition , angela merkel 's christian democrats and its junior governing partner , the social democrats , agreed that rises in managers ' pay must be determined by the entire supervisory board and not just a small coterie .
the coalition are to formulate further measures relating to managers in a working group over the coming weeks . disagreement on a number of matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before the crisis , germany 's managerial class was embroiled in a number of scandals but the cdu rejected the spd 's call for curbs on executive pay .
the social democrats had wanted firms only to be able to write off salaries and redundancy payments against tax if they did not exceed a million euros .
the parties were also unable to reach agreement on the introduction of minimum pay for temps and a reform of the job centers for the unemployed . the conservatives parliamentary party leader volker kauder expressed disappointment with the outcome of the meeting in the chancellery .
" we have achieved something , but , of course , it could have been more , " he told germany 's public broadcaster ard .
peter ramsauer , from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , was more negative , describing the talks that went on into the early morning as the " hardest " and the " toughest " since the government took office three-and-a-half years ago . " this foreshadows the end of the coalition , " said ramsauer , alluding to the coalition 's increasing difficulty to reach compromise as the parties gear up for germany 's september elections .
election ?
what election ?
but spd parliamentary party leader peter struck dismissed ramsauer 's comments as " nonsense " , saying he had experienced " tougher " talks .
" we have to work hard that 's why we are elected , " he said .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck also struck a positive note , saying that the coalition had made progress in achieving such a broad consensus on financial matters .
" these are very pleasing results to come out of the coalition committee meeting , " he stressed on thursday .
other measures agreed at the meeting included the introduction of a number of regulations relating to environmental matters .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cologne archive collapses by preserving the past in libraries and archives we can understand our present and know things that were forgotten . - jose nigrin , guatemala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city archives were home to thousands of original documents it is extremely distressing to read about the great cultural and historic loss of documents and other items apparently lost in the building 's collapse .
i hope that a recovery effort is possible .
without preserving its past , no country has a future . - samuel r. ganczaruk , usa it is critical to know our history or we will make the same mistakes over and over .
all people have an interest in where we have been . - john w. baker , usa that is really tragic about the cologne archive , considering that a lot was lost in world war ii as well .
i think that the advantage of digital over microfilm is that it is easy to back up and make a number of extra copies and that an enormous amount of information can be stored .
that would make keeping several backup copies much easier .
i think that software is no limitation since they can always be switched from one medium to another .
for archive material , 10 copies should be saved as to be sure of not losing anything .
the most work of course is digitizing it in the first place . - philip , canada germany debates bailing out opel general motors as well as many large corporations must be broken up into smaller privately owned companies .

i wonder if there would be a way to redesign the parts needed for cars of the past and future ones , to be more environmentally friendly .
also , maybe this seems far-fetched , but what if when the company does go " green " that they offer some incentive to past owners to convert their cars to " green " technology ?
maybe a tax rebate or to reinvest somehow in the parent company so worker 's could have some job security ? - dawn , usa by reducing the salaries of all the staff by 10 percent to 20 percent at opel , they will be able to maintain the skills of all employees when the situation improves .
no retraining will be needed as all the skills will be in place .
reduce production to say four days a week and just hang in there .
reduce car prices to attract customers , review work procedures and see what activities can be simplified and expedited or eliminated . - murray clarkson , south africa i think opel is moving in the right direction .
general motors is so hard hit that one must fear its demise .
perhaps under the umbrella of another carmaker , opel could find the time to reorganize under visionary leadership .
if the workers are convinced that it is a life or death situation , they will rally and even be ready for some sacrifices . - elisabeth heptner , usa germany should set up a holding company called " deutsche motoren se " that brings together bmw , daimler and opel as well as porsche to protect europe from the asian imports . - charles de carlo , australia a semi-independent opel separate from gm is completely unacceptable .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

wolfsburg pulled one back on 10 minutes when edin dezko netted from close range and dezko leveled matters with his sixth goal in two cup games one minute before the break after bremen defender per mertesacker let him head home unchallenged .
however , diego restored bremen 's two goal lead with a penalty on 55 minutes before pizarro made the game safe on 71 minutes after being set up by substitute hugo almeida .
pizarro completed the rout with his second of the game a minute from time , although the referee did appear to ignore a raised flag by his assistant .
bremen have now won their last five cup games against wolfsburg .

" thank god we found our game again as when it was 2-0 we must have obviously thought that it would get a bit easier . "

the hope is that clinton 's meeting with the russians will signal start of a new era in trans-atlantic relations . clinton was given a red-carpet welcome at the european parliament on friday , march 6 , shaking hands with well-wishers and signing autographs .
clinton hopes to keep the good will going as she meets with top russian officials on friday evening .
it 's the first high-level meeting between the two countries since barack obama became president in january .
no major decisions are expected , but the obama administration has said it hopes to improve relations . on thursday , nato announced that it would resume the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , including at the ministerial level .
the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .
the conference would be held in brussels on march 31 , dpa said . the secretary of state also told ministers that the us 's strategic review of its afghanistan mission would push for a stepping-up of efforts on the civilian side . it would also focus on " realistic and achievable " targets , such as preventing afghanistan from becoming a failed state or a safe haven for terrorists , rather than a western-style democracy , diplomats said . global security german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said support among nato members for a return to high-level ties with russia was overwhelming . " i think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in nato , and also , hopefully , a new atmosphere of cooperation , " he said .
" we will need both because our tasks will not get any easier . " the -lrb- georgia -rrb- crisis , which is now behind us militarily ... can not leave us in a situation where we refuse to talk , " said steinmeier , a long-time advocate of reconciliation with moscow . dfm / nda / th / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but germany has expressed reservations about gm 's request for european aid . the proposal for a mini-european summit from industry commissioner guenter verheugen came on the same day as gm 's auditors voiced " substantial doubt " about the parent company 's ability to stay afloat in its annual report . verheugen said thursday , march 5 , that he would like to see coordinated , european action on gm 's restructuring plans . " we need a common market not a purely national one , " he said .
" i would like to know what the various member states with gm sites are thinking of doing . " gm has said it is conducting talks for aid with the governments of all the european countries where it has factories , including germany .
in addition to opel 's activities in germany , where it has four plants , the company also has production sites in belgium , britain , poland and spain . belgium is particularly concerned that a bilateral deal between germany and gm could come at the cost of its opel factory in antwerp . the time is not right ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economics minister has reacted cautiously to proposed european talks but germany 's new economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said a european coordination summit would only make sense if gm revealed what exactly it is planning to do with its european factories and operations . " there are many issues that still have not been clarified , " guttenberg said the german government , who are still mulling opel 's request for 3.3 billion euros of financial help from european governments , also raised the pressure on opel 's management on thursday . finance minister peer steinbrueck said the restructuring plan submitted by the executives on monday did not provide an adequate basis for political decisions .
berlin has told opel that it needs time to carefully examine their business concept . german chancellor angela merkel has said that opel would not receive special treatment under the government 's industrial rescue plan .
berlin has provided cash and loan guarantees to a number of financial institutions that were deemed too big to be allowed to fail . dire warning from union leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of gm employees ' jobs are threatened in europe gm has over 55,000 employees in europe including 26,000 in germany .
a senior german union official has warned that the collapse of the opel unit would lead to the loss of around 400,000 jobs across europe as jobs at companies that supply opel would also be axed . armin schild , of the metalworkers ' union ig metall , told the daily berliner zeitung that the car and the auto supply sector would be equally hard hit . " the german government must support opel financially as a matter of urgency , " he told the newspaper .
" the consequences of a possible bankruptcy would be more expensive than the aid that opel needs , " he added . jg / sms / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .

official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession .

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world . " with the neues museum 's completion , only one institution on berlin 's museum island remains unfinished .
the altes nationalgalerie was renovated in 2001 and work on the bode museum was completed five years later .
the pergamon museum and the altes museum are due to be restored by 2026 . " the opening marks an important day for the museum island but also for berlin and the whole of germany , " hermann parzinger , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation which manages regional museums , told reporters . home to egyptian collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of nefertiti will receive a hall of its own in the museum the neues museum , which will open to the public in october , will house the archaeological collections of the capital 's egyptian museum including the 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti , which will have its own hall . " after 11 years , i 'm a little reluctant to hand over the keys today , " joked said british star architect david chipperfield , who won a competition to restore the building in 1997 . the island in the spree river is located in what used to be communist east germany and was not the subject of major renovation until the berlin wall fell 20 years ago .
the renovation of the island 's institutions has cost about 1 billion euros and the government is slated to spend another 500 million on related projects by 2025 . museum 's ' strange chronology ' unesco named the museum island a world cultural heritage site in 1999 and german officials have said that when completed the site will rival paris ' louvre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes visitors will flock to the newly completed museum the neues museum , which got its name because it was built shortly after the city 's old museum , is roughly rectangular , with high ceilings creating a light and airy atmosphere .
one of the building 's focal points is a grand staircase , which leads to the top floors and is a lasting monument to its first architect , friedrich august stueler . " the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .
a un-au mission currently has 15,179 total uniformed personnel in darfur , including 12,359 troops , 181 military observers , 2,639 police officers . dfm / nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

others wrote in to support a bail-out plan for opel . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cologne archive collapses by preserving the past in libraries and archives we can understand our present and know things that were forgotten . - jose nigrin , guatemala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city archives were home to thousands of original documents it is extremely distressing to read about the great cultural and historic loss of documents and other items apparently lost in the building 's collapse .
i hope that a recovery effort is possible .
without preserving its past , no country has a future . - samuel r. ganczaruk , usa it is critical to know our history or we will make the same mistakes over and over .
all people have an interest in where we have been . - john w. baker , usa that is really tragic about the cologne archive , considering that a lot was lost in world war ii as well .
i think that the advantage of digital over microfilm is that it is easy to back up and make a number of extra copies and that an enormous amount of information can be stored .
that would make keeping several backup copies much easier .

others wrote in to support a bail-out plan for opel . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cologne archive collapses by preserving the past in libraries and archives we can understand our present and know things that were forgotten . - jose nigrin , guatemala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city archives were home to thousands of original documents it is extremely distressing to read about the great cultural and historic loss of documents and other items apparently lost in the building 's collapse .
i hope that a recovery effort is possible .
without preserving its past , no country has a future . - samuel r. ganczaruk , usa it is critical to know our history or we will make the same mistakes over and over .
all people have an interest in where we have been . - john w. baker , usa that is really tragic about the cologne archive , considering that a lot was lost in world war ii as well .
i think that the advantage of digital over microfilm is that it is easy to back up and make a number of extra copies and that an enormous amount of information can be stored .
that would make keeping several backup copies much easier .
i think that software is no limitation since they can always be switched from one medium to another .
for archive material , 10 copies should be saved as to be sure of not losing anything .
the most work of course is digitizing it in the first place . - philip , canada germany debates bailing out opel general motors as well as many large corporations must be broken up into smaller privately owned companies .
i believe the world needs to consider the real value to society of large corporations .
the problem with large corporations , is when you are so big , when you are the only company to produce a certain product , you have no need to provide a quality . - lee davis , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers discussed opel 's chances of survival independent of gm my heart goes out to all who have worked in the auto industry .
i wonder if there would be a way to redesign the parts needed for cars of the past and future ones , to be more environmentally friendly .
also , maybe this seems far-fetched , but what if when the company does go " green " that they offer some incentive to past owners to convert their cars to " green " technology ?
maybe a tax rebate or to reinvest somehow in the parent company so worker 's could have some job security ? - dawn , usa by reducing the salaries of all the staff by 10 percent to 20 percent at opel , they will be able to maintain the skills of all employees when the situation improves .
no retraining will be needed as all the skills will be in place .
reduce production to say four days a week and just hang in there .
reduce car prices to attract customers , review work procedures and see what activities can be simplified and expedited or eliminated . - murray clarkson , south africa i think opel is moving in the right direction .
general motors is so hard hit that one must fear its demise .
perhaps under the umbrella of another carmaker , opel could find the time to reorganize under visionary leadership .
if the workers are convinced that it is a life or death situation , they will rally and even be ready for some sacrifices . - elisabeth heptner , usa germany should set up a holding company called " deutsche motoren se " that brings together bmw , daimler and opel as well as porsche to protect europe from the asian imports . - charles de carlo , australia a semi-independent opel separate from gm is completely unacceptable .
saab is already in bankruptcy for the purpose of restructuring and the same should be required for opel and vauxhall .

they are the first of a larger group that the eu has agreed to permanently resettle .
but german human rights groups are calling for more . human rights groups have welcomed the start of the program , but see it as just scratching the surface of the problem .
german organizations called on berlin to establish a permanent resettlement scheme .
the eu decided in november to take in 10,000 of the most vulnerable refugees who had fled war-torn iraq .
germany is set to receive 2,500 from camps in syria and iran .
other member states participating in the scheme are britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden .
priority was given to single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties in europe , according to the eu criteria .
successsful asylum applicants had to have a clean criminal record and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
way out for trapped refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees fear iraq is still too dangerous to go back or fear persecution guenter burkhardt from the organization pro asyl described the scheme as starting to offer a way out of a " dead-end " for people from religious minorities and others in need of protection from iraq .
but he added that far more than 2,500 people were in need of help , describing it as a drop in the ocean .
burkhardt said that an ongoing resettlement program should be set up in germany .
" there is room in germany , " he said .
" many of these people are educated .
our society needs people like them . "
julia duchrow , from amnesty international , expressed confidence that it would be possible to achieve a political consensus in germany in favor of a permanent annual scheme .
but she did not quantify the number of refugees that she would like to see taken in .
duchrow said priority should be given to people with relatives in germany , as that helped to promote their integration .

" the arrival of the first people represents a success on our behalf , but we need to bear in mind that this is only the first phase of a long process , " duchrow , from amnesty international , told reporters .
burkhardt , from pro asly said it was essential to enable a " successful integration " of the group , adding that refugees are often forced to live on the periphery of society .
about two million iraqi refugees have fled to jordan and syria since the invasion of the country by us-led forces in march 2003 .
the federal office for refugees and migrants said iraqis accounted for around one third of asylum applications received since the start of 2009 .
the number of asylum applicants in germany has dropped dramatically in recent years .

germany is set to receive 2,500 from camps in syria and iran .

the game at the ltu arena in dusseldorf was scoreless at halftime but leverkusen raced into a 3-0 lead after the break thanks to goals from tranquillo barnetta , arturo vidal and patrick helmes .
lucio and miroslav klose reduced the deficit to 3-2 with two goals in the space of three minutes but juergen klinsmann 's side could n't find the equalizer in the remaining 16 minutes and leverkusen made the game safe in added time with a goal from stefan kiessling .

the alliance is also expected to reopen talks with russia . the meeting in brussels is the first by the united states ' new chief diplomat , who kicked off her maiden voyage to europe with a trans-atlantic dinner hosted by the belgian government on wednesday evening . thursday 's nato ministers ' meeting takes place as us president barack obama prepares to deploy 17,000 additional troops in afghanistan and is busy putting the finishing touches to its strategic review of the war against the taliban insurgency as the main contributor to nato 's operations in the country . however , senior us officials at nato said ahead of the meeting that clinton was also keen to " listen to our allies , to consult , to take part in an effort of building a strong consensus , a strong sense of solidarity and shared commitment . " obama 's election was warmly welcomed in europe , where hopes are high that he will bring new momentum to diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts around the world . clinton is expected to " underscore some of the emerging thoughts from the new administration about how we are looking at some of the challenges , " including afghanistan and eastern europe , us officials told the german dpa news agency . election in afghanistan nato 's main topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is considering troop levels ahead of afghan elections in august nato officials say much of thursday morning 's discussions will be devoted to the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan and its role in the aug .
20 presidential and provincial elections .
the alliance 's commanders have called for the deployment of four additional battalions in the country 's south , north and west to protect voters from possible taliban attacks during the election . nato officials also welcomed a decision by the country 's independent election committee on wednesday not to bring forward the poll , as had been requested by afghan president hamid karzai , saying it would give the alliance the time needed to boost its security measures . but signs of warming relations between washington and brussels are also evident in foreign ministers ' likely decision to resume direct talks with russia . re-establishing direct talks with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official talks between russia and nato are likely to restart the main forum for such talks , the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , was suspended by the alliance in the aftermath of the russia-georgia war in august and moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . but there is now a growing consensus within the 26-member alliance that such meetings should resume . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who plans to brief ministers about his recent talks with russian officials , " hopes that tomorrow 's meeting will lead to a decision to re-engage in the nrc , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . " there are clear areas where nato and russia need to engage more fully - on afghanistan , terrorism and in other areas , " appathurai reporters , adding that a formal ambassadorial level meeting of the nato-russia council could happen " very , very quickly . " at the same time , the resumption of nrc meetings would " in no way diminish " nato 's condemnation of the august conflict and russia 's plans to build up its military presence in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , appathurai said . missile defense differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato meeting is part of clinton 's first trip to europe as secretary of state despite the nrc freeze , nato and russia are already actively cooperating in several areas , including in afghanistan and on international counter-piracy missions . tension between moscow and washington has also been eased by obama 's suggestion this week that preventing iran from developing a nuclear weapon would diminish the need for the united states to base a missile-defense system in eastern europe . plans by former us president george w. bush to place 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic had drawn strong criticisms from russian president dmitry medvedev , with moscow viewing the deployment as a threat to its own strategic nuclear deterrent . thursday 's is the last high-level nato meeting before the alliance celebrates its 60th birthday at a summit in strasbourg and its german suburb of kehl on april 3-4 . sms / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hope is that clinton 's meeting with the russians will signal start of a new era in trans-atlantic relations . clinton was given a red-carpet welcome at the european parliament on friday , march 6 , shaking hands with well-wishers and signing autographs .
clinton hopes to keep the good will going as she meets with top russian officials on friday evening .
it 's the first high-level meeting between the two countries since barack obama became president in january .
no major decisions are expected , but the obama administration has said it hopes to improve relations . on thursday , nato announced that it would resume the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , including at the ministerial level .
the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .
the conference would be held in brussels on march 31 , dpa said . the secretary of state also told ministers that the us 's strategic review of its afghanistan mission would push for a stepping-up of efforts on the civilian side . it would also focus on " realistic and achievable " targets , such as preventing afghanistan from becoming a failed state or a safe haven for terrorists , rather than a western-style democracy , diplomats said . global security german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said support among nato members for a return to high-level ties with russia was overwhelming . " i think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in nato , and also , hopefully , a new atmosphere of cooperation , " he said .
" we will need both because our tasks will not get any easier . " the -lrb- georgia -rrb- crisis , which is now behind us militarily ... can not leave us in a situation where we refuse to talk , " said steinmeier , a long-time advocate of reconciliation with moscow . dfm / nda / th / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alliance is also expected to reopen talks with russia . the meeting in brussels is the first by the united states ' new chief diplomat , who kicked off her maiden voyage to europe with a trans-atlantic dinner hosted by the belgian government on wednesday evening . thursday 's nato ministers ' meeting takes place as us president barack obama prepares to deploy 17,000 additional troops in afghanistan and is busy putting the finishing touches to its strategic review of the war against the taliban insurgency as the main contributor to nato 's operations in the country . however , senior us officials at nato said ahead of the meeting that clinton was also keen to " listen to our allies , to consult , to take part in an effort of building a strong consensus , a strong sense of solidarity and shared commitment . " obama 's election was warmly welcomed in europe , where hopes are high that he will bring new momentum to diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts around the world . clinton is expected to " underscore some of the emerging thoughts from the new administration about how we are looking at some of the challenges , " including afghanistan and eastern europe , us officials told the german dpa news agency . election in afghanistan nato 's main topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is considering troop levels ahead of afghan elections in august nato officials say much of thursday morning 's discussions will be devoted to the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan and its role in the aug .
20 presidential and provincial elections .
the alliance 's commanders have called for the deployment of four additional battalions in the country 's south , north and west to protect voters from possible taliban attacks during the election . nato officials also welcomed a decision by the country 's independent election committee on wednesday not to bring forward the poll , as had been requested by afghan president hamid karzai , saying it would give the alliance the time needed to boost its security measures . but signs of warming relations between washington and brussels are also evident in foreign ministers ' likely decision to resume direct talks with russia . re-establishing direct talks with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official talks between russia and nato are likely to restart the main forum for such talks , the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , was suspended by the alliance in the aftermath of the russia-georgia war in august and moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . but there is now a growing consensus within the 26-member alliance that such meetings should resume . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , who plans to brief ministers about his recent talks with russian officials , " hopes that tomorrow 's meeting will lead to a decision to re-engage in the nrc , " said nato spokesman james appathurai . " there are clear areas where nato and russia need to engage more fully - on afghanistan , terrorism and in other areas , " appathurai reporters , adding that a formal ambassadorial level meeting of the nato-russia council could happen " very , very quickly . " at the same time , the resumption of nrc meetings would " in no way diminish " nato 's condemnation of the august conflict and russia 's plans to build up its military presence in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , appathurai said . missile defense differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nato meeting is part of clinton 's first trip to europe as secretary of state despite the nrc freeze , nato and russia are already actively cooperating in several areas , including in afghanistan and on international counter-piracy missions . tension between moscow and washington has also been eased by obama 's suggestion this week that preventing iran from developing a nuclear weapon would diminish the need for the united states to base a missile-defense system in eastern europe . plans by former us president george w. bush to place 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic had drawn strong criticisms from russian president dmitry medvedev , with moscow viewing the deployment as a threat to its own strategic nuclear deterrent . thursday 's is the last high-level nato meeting before the alliance celebrates its 60th birthday at a summit in strasbourg and its german suburb of kehl on april 3-4 . sms / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the parties were also unable to reach agreement on the introduction of minimum pay for temps and a reform of the job centers for the unemployed . the conservatives parliamentary party leader volker kauder expressed disappointment with the outcome of the meeting in the chancellery .
" we have achieved something , but , of course , it could have been more , " he told germany 's public broadcaster ard .
peter ramsauer , from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , was more negative , describing the talks that went on into the early morning as the " hardest " and the " toughest " since the government took office three-and-a-half years ago . " this foreshadows the end of the coalition , " said ramsauer , alluding to the coalition 's increasing difficulty to reach compromise as the parties gear up for germany 's september elections .

" we have to work hard that 's why we are elected , " he said .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

the game at the ltu arena in dusseldorf was scoreless at halftime but leverkusen raced into a 3-0 lead after the break thanks to goals from tranquillo barnetta , arturo vidal and patrick helmes .
lucio and miroslav klose reduced the deficit to 3-2 with two goals in the space of three minutes but juergen klinsmann 's side could n't find the equalizer in the remaining 16 minutes and leverkusen made the game safe in added time with a goal from stefan kiessling .
" unfortunately , we have to forget about the cup but it wo n't help to have a go at the boys , " said klinsmann .
" something was missing for an hour and we have to digest that now . "

diego showed brilliant technical skill to make it 1-0 after just three minutes and then helped set up the second by cleverly blocking his opponent to allow ozil to run through to score .
wolfsburg pulled one back on 10 minutes when edin dezko netted from close range and dezko leveled matters with his sixth goal in two cup games one minute before the break after bremen defender per mertesacker let him head home unchallenged .
however , diego restored bremen 's two goal lead with a penalty on 55 minutes before pizarro made the game safe on 71 minutes after being set up by substitute hugo almeida .
pizarro completed the rout with his second of the game a minute from time , although the referee did appear to ignore a raised flag by his assistant .

the hope is that clinton 's meeting with the russians will signal start of a new era in trans-atlantic relations . clinton was given a red-carpet welcome at the european parliament on friday , march 6 , shaking hands with well-wishers and signing autographs .
clinton hopes to keep the good will going as she meets with top russian officials on friday evening .
it 's the first high-level meeting between the two countries since barack obama became president in january .
no major decisions are expected , but the obama administration has said it hopes to improve relations . on thursday , nato announced that it would resume the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , including at the ministerial level .
the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .
the conference would be held in brussels on march 31 , dpa said . the secretary of state also told ministers that the us 's strategic review of its afghanistan mission would push for a stepping-up of efforts on the civilian side . it would also focus on " realistic and achievable " targets , such as preventing afghanistan from becoming a failed state or a safe haven for terrorists , rather than a western-style democracy , diplomats said . global security german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said support among nato members for a return to high-level ties with russia was overwhelming . " i think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in nato , and also , hopefully , a new atmosphere of cooperation , " he said .
" we will need both because our tasks will not get any easier . " the -lrb- georgia -rrb- crisis , which is now behind us militarily ... can not leave us in a situation where we refuse to talk , " said steinmeier , a long-time advocate of reconciliation with moscow . dfm / nda / th / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .

" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .

there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .
a un-au mission currently has 15,179 total uniformed personnel in darfur , including 12,359 troops , 181 military observers , 2,639 police officers . dfm / nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others wrote in to support a bail-out plan for opel . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cologne archive collapses by preserving the past in libraries and archives we can understand our present and know things that were forgotten . - jose nigrin , guatemala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city archives were home to thousands of original documents it is extremely distressing to read about the great cultural and historic loss of documents and other items apparently lost in the building 's collapse .
i hope that a recovery effort is possible .
without preserving its past , no country has a future . - samuel r. ganczaruk , usa it is critical to know our history or we will make the same mistakes over and over .
all people have an interest in where we have been . - john w. baker , usa that is really tragic about the cologne archive , considering that a lot was lost in world war ii as well .
i think that the advantage of digital over microfilm is that it is easy to back up and make a number of extra copies and that an enormous amount of information can be stored .
that would make keeping several backup copies much easier .
i think that software is no limitation since they can always be switched from one medium to another .

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world .

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world . " with the neues museum 's completion , only one institution on berlin 's museum island remains unfinished .
the altes nationalgalerie was renovated in 2001 and work on the bode museum was completed five years later .
the pergamon museum and the altes museum are due to be restored by 2026 .

" the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following .

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .
official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .
the ecb has already slashed rates by 225 basis points since october . gloomy news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone economy will contract by more than first though , the ecb says the ecb also released thursday a series of negative forecasts for the coming two years , saying it expected the euro-zone economy to contract by 2.7 percent in 2009 , a significantly gloomier forecast than the central bank 's previous prediction of a 0.5 percent shrinkage for this year . the central bank said it expected zero growth in the european single market in 2010 , down from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent growth . the bank said output this year could be anywhere between minus 2.2 percent and minus 3.2 percent .
official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .
a un-au mission currently has 15,179 total uniformed personnel in darfur , including 12,359 troops , 181 military observers , 2,639 police officers . dfm / nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others wrote in to support a bail-out plan for opel . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cologne archive collapses by preserving the past in libraries and archives we can understand our present and know things that were forgotten . - jose nigrin , guatemala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city archives were home to thousands of original documents it is extremely distressing to read about the great cultural and historic loss of documents and other items apparently lost in the building 's collapse .
i hope that a recovery effort is possible .
without preserving its past , no country has a future . - samuel r. ganczaruk , usa it is critical to know our history or we will make the same mistakes over and over .
all people have an interest in where we have been . - john w. baker , usa that is really tragic about the cologne archive , considering that a lot was lost in world war ii as well .
i think that the advantage of digital over microfilm is that it is easy to back up and make a number of extra copies and that an enormous amount of information can be stored .
that would make keeping several backup copies much easier .
i think that software is no limitation since they can always be switched from one medium to another .
for archive material , 10 copies should be saved as to be sure of not losing anything .
the most work of course is digitizing it in the first place . - philip , canada germany debates bailing out opel general motors as well as many large corporations must be broken up into smaller privately owned companies .
i believe the world needs to consider the real value to society of large corporations .
the problem with large corporations , is when you are so big , when you are the only company to produce a certain product , you have no need to provide a quality . - lee davis , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers discussed opel 's chances of survival independent of gm my heart goes out to all who have worked in the auto industry .
i wonder if there would be a way to redesign the parts needed for cars of the past and future ones , to be more environmentally friendly .
also , maybe this seems far-fetched , but what if when the company does go " green " that they offer some incentive to past owners to convert their cars to " green " technology ?
maybe a tax rebate or to reinvest somehow in the parent company so worker 's could have some job security ? - dawn , usa by reducing the salaries of all the staff by 10 percent to 20 percent at opel , they will be able to maintain the skills of all employees when the situation improves .
no retraining will be needed as all the skills will be in place .
reduce production to say four days a week and just hang in there .
reduce car prices to attract customers , review work procedures and see what activities can be simplified and expedited or eliminated . - murray clarkson , south africa i think opel is moving in the right direction .
general motors is so hard hit that one must fear its demise .
perhaps under the umbrella of another carmaker , opel could find the time to reorganize under visionary leadership .
if the workers are convinced that it is a life or death situation , they will rally and even be ready for some sacrifices . - elisabeth heptner , usa germany should set up a holding company called " deutsche motoren se " that brings together bmw , daimler and opel as well as porsche to protect europe from the asian imports . - charles de carlo , australia a semi-independent opel separate from gm is completely unacceptable .
saab is already in bankruptcy for the purpose of restructuring and the same should be required for opel and vauxhall .
only after that will private and state capital restructure the carmaker for merger with another company . - hans reuther-fix , argentina the federal government as well as those of the german states where opel has factories will have to help opel in some way as the auto industry is such an important part of the german economy .
it is not just the jobs at the four factories in germany but the suppliers of parts and components for opel that will be affected .
i am glad that the german government wants to explore all options before making a final decision and not be rushed into a decision . - stuart john pearson , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hope is that clinton 's meeting with the russians will signal start of a new era in trans-atlantic relations . clinton was given a red-carpet welcome at the european parliament on friday , march 6 , shaking hands with well-wishers and signing autographs .
clinton hopes to keep the good will going as she meets with top russian officials on friday evening .
it 's the first high-level meeting between the two countries since barack obama became president in january .
no major decisions are expected , but the obama administration has said it hopes to improve relations . on thursday , nato announced that it would resume the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , including at the ministerial level .
the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .
the conference would be held in brussels on march 31 , dpa said . the secretary of state also told ministers that the us 's strategic review of its afghanistan mission would push for a stepping-up of efforts on the civilian side . it would also focus on " realistic and achievable " targets , such as preventing afghanistan from becoming a failed state or a safe haven for terrorists , rather than a western-style democracy , diplomats said . global security german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said support among nato members for a return to high-level ties with russia was overwhelming . " i think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in nato , and also , hopefully , a new atmosphere of cooperation , " he said .
" we will need both because our tasks will not get any easier . " the -lrb- georgia -rrb- crisis , which is now behind us militarily ... can not leave us in a situation where we refuse to talk , " said steinmeier , a long-time advocate of reconciliation with moscow . dfm / nda / th / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nrc acts as the main forum for direct dialog between the two sides . russia ca n't be ignored " russia is an important player , a global player , " nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said .
" not talking to them is not an option . " the resumption of talks is critical since there are a number of current issues where the alliance and moscow need to exchange their views , scheffer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the short war between russia and georgia remains a concern " we have quite a number of areas where we have fundamental differences of opinion and where we think russia should change its opinion , " he added . scheffer did not provide a date or venue for the next meeting , but said it should happen " as soon as possible after the summit " to mark nato 's 60th anniversary on april 3-4 . the news was greeted positively in moscow , where a foreign ministry spokesman told the interfax news agency that russia noted " with satisfaction that good sense has prevailed within nato . " however , the official expressed regret that the alliance ministers had made the decision on a " unilateral " basis , saying : " this should be a joint decision made with russia . " nrc meetings were effectively frozen by nato after russia 's war with georgia in august as well as moscow 's subsequent recognition of the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states . nato ministers on thursday stressed that the alliance was still deeply angered by russia 's decision to invade georgia and recognize the breakaway territories .
but they also acknowledged that they needed russian help in dealing with afghanistan , preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism . us approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a date has not yet been set for the next council meeting earlier thursday , us secretary of state hillary clinton told alliance foreign ministers it was time for a fresh start in relations with the kremlin through a resumption of the nrc . " we can and must find ways to work constructively with russia where we share areas of common interest , including helping the people of afghanistan , " she said at her first meeting with nato ministers .
" it is time to move ahead , not wait in place with the illusion that things will change on their own . " while some perceive the nato-russia council as a reward or concession to russia , it should be viewed as a mechanism for dialog on issues where we disagree and a platform for cooperation that is in our interests , " she said . clinton added that nato must leave the door open for nato membership to georgia and ex-soviet satellite state ukraine , despite seeking to repair ties with the kremlin , which opposes alliance membership for both states . afghan review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and nato say russia can help in afghanistan with a sharp focus on afghanistan , clinton proposed a regional conference with key players including nato , the un , russia , india and pakistan aimed at stabilizing the middle eastern country , diplomats said , according to a report by the dpa news agency .
the conference would be held in brussels on march 31 , dpa said . the secretary of state also told ministers that the us 's strategic review of its afghanistan mission would push for a stepping-up of efforts on the civilian side . it would also focus on " realistic and achievable " targets , such as preventing afghanistan from becoming a failed state or a safe haven for terrorists , rather than a western-style democracy , diplomats said . global security german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said support among nato members for a return to high-level ties with russia was overwhelming . " i think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in nato , and also , hopefully , a new atmosphere of cooperation , " he said .
" we will need both because our tasks will not get any easier . " the -lrb- georgia -rrb- crisis , which is now behind us militarily ... can not leave us in a situation where we refuse to talk , " said steinmeier , a long-time advocate of reconciliation with moscow . dfm / nda / th / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german organizations called on berlin to establish a permanent resettlement scheme .
the eu decided in november to take in 10,000 of the most vulnerable refugees who had fled war-torn iraq .
germany is set to receive 2,500 from camps in syria and iran .
other member states participating in the scheme are britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden .
priority was given to single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties in europe , according to the eu criteria .

burkhardt said that an ongoing resettlement program should be set up in germany .

the game at the ltu arena in dusseldorf was scoreless at halftime but leverkusen raced into a 3-0 lead after the break thanks to goals from tranquillo barnetta , arturo vidal and patrick helmes .
lucio and miroslav klose reduced the deficit to 3-2 with two goals in the space of three minutes but juergen klinsmann 's side could n't find the equalizer in the remaining 16 minutes and leverkusen made the game safe in added time with a goal from stefan kiessling .
" unfortunately , we have to forget about the cup but it wo n't help to have a go at the boys , " said klinsmann .
" something was missing for an hour and we have to digest that now . "
bayer coach bruno labbadia , meanwhile , said the victory was fully earned .
" we have a really young team with great potential , " he said .
" this win was an important step , not least in the minds of the players . "
bremen turn on the style to reach semis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg could n't overcome bremen five-time winners bremen raced into an early two-goal lead thanks goals in the first six minutes from midfielders diego and mesut ozil and although wolfsburg managed to restore parity , a brace from claudio pizarro ensured a comfortable win for thomas schaaf 's side .
diego showed brilliant technical skill to make it 1-0 after just three minutes and then helped set up the second by cleverly blocking his opponent to allow ozil to run through to score .
wolfsburg pulled one back on 10 minutes when edin dezko netted from close range and dezko leveled matters with his sixth goal in two cup games one minute before the break after bremen defender per mertesacker let him head home unchallenged .
however , diego restored bremen 's two goal lead with a penalty on 55 minutes before pizarro made the game safe on 71 minutes after being set up by substitute hugo almeida .
pizarro completed the rout with his second of the game a minute from time , although the referee did appear to ignore a raised flag by his assistant .
bremen have now won their last five cup games against wolfsburg .
" it was a great game , " said schaff .
" thank god we found our game again as when it was 2-0 we must have obviously thought that it would get a bit easier . "
hamburg survive nail-biting finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg survived a late scare before they could celebrate in the other match , hamburg looked to be cruising against wehen after a marko kopilas own goal on 17 minutes and a mladen petric strike on 37 gave martin jol 's side a 2-0 lead .
however , sandro schwarz made it 2-1 in the 85th minute , setting up a tense finish for the bundesliga side .
" i 'm happy that we are through , " said jol .
" naturally we want the title as well . "

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

the bank of england cut its lending rate by 50 basis points . the hefty 50-basis-point rate cut by the ecb had been widely expected , with market focus swiftly turning thursday to a press conference held by the financial body 's chief jean-claude trichet , who said the central bank could further lower its main interest rate in the coming months . " we did not ex ante decide that this was the lowest we could attain , " he said . with inflationary pressures diminishing and a severe economic downturn having set in , tichet warned that inflation in the 16-member euro zone could slip to " negative levels " in the coming months with the recession playing havoc with public finances across the currency bloc . but trichet stressed that the bank saw " a number of drawbacks " with a zero interest rate level and said the ecb was considering a series of " non-standard measures " to help monetary policy underpin growth . " we do not exclude anything , " he said . non-standard monetary measures , referred to by economists as quantitative easing , can involve printing more money to ease the pressure on banks . " we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures , " he told reporters .
" i will not elaborate on that .
we have absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure . " many analysts believe that the ecb will lop another 50 basis points off euro zone rates by the middle of the year , bringing the refinancing rate down to just 1 percent .

official eu data showed thursday that collapsing exports and dwindling business investment had pushed the euro zone economy into the deepest contraction in the bloc 's 10-year history . british cuts meanwhile , the bank of england applied the twin tools of interest rate cuts and a boost in money supply in an effort to revive the recession-hit british economy . the bank 's monetary policy committee cut the key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.5 percent and injected an initial 75 billion pounds -lrb- 84.6 billion euros -rrb- into the economy through quantitative easing . under the process , so far untried in britain , the bank will launch a program of asset purchases - such as government bonds and corporate assets - financed by the issuance of central bank reserves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank of england also cuts lending rates to a record low with interest rates now close to zero , the boe had itself admitted it was running out of monetary tools to help revive the economy in the midst of a deepening recession . " world activity continued to weaken , reflecting both depressed confidence and the persistent problems in international credit markets , " the bank said in a statement thursday . figures down across the board at the same time , another round of grim earning results from leading banks and financial houses has sparked renewed concerns about the state of the global financial sector . the international monetary fund predicts that euro zone economic growth will slump by 2 percent in the wake of the global downturn , which was triggered by a crisis in the us banking business . economic confidence in the euro zone plunged to an historic low last month , the european commission 's closely watched economic sentiment indicator showed last week , while unemployment climbed to a 28-month high of 8.2 percent in january . despite february 's unexpected tick up in the euro zone 's annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent , consumer prices remain well below the ecb 's 2-percent inflation target . dfm / sms / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the media expert said the issue has concerned him for years and hinted at a smear campaign against him . prosecutors said they had launched an investigation into joerg tauss because there was " an initial suspicion " of the existence of incriminating pictorial material .
however , the spokesman added that tauss could be " completely innocent . "

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .
" what we see is that international justice seems to be applying its fight against impunity only to africa as if nothing were happening elsewhere - in iraq , gaza , colombia or in the caucasus . "
the icc issued an international arrest warrant for al-bashir on wednesday on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
it was the first time the body has sought the arrest of a sitting president .
according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .
a un-au mission currently has 15,179 total uniformed personnel in darfur , including 12,359 troops , 181 military observers , 2,639 police officers . dfm / nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to un estimates up to 300,000 people have died since ethnic minority rebels in darfur took up arms against the arab-dominated regime in 2003 .
the un says that around 2.7 million people have been displaced because of the conflict .
the government in khartoum rejects these figures and any claims of genocide .
russia , china skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and sudan have a resources-based relationship uganda 's foreign minister sam kutesa said a one-year suspension of the arrest warrant was necessary " in order to balance getting rid of impunity and getting a sustainable peace in darfur . "
the arab league meanwhile said it was " very disturbed " and " dismayed that the un security council did not delay the court proceedings . "
there was skepticism in moscow 's reaction to the warrant , with a russian foreign ministry spokesman also warning that the icc decision could further destabilize the situation in sudan .
china likewise refused to give its backing to the decision , instead saying the issuance of the warrant was regretful and concerning to beijing .
" china expresses its regretfulness and worry over the arrest warrant for the sudan president issued by the international criminal court , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said .
qin called on the un security council to " respect calls by the african union , arab league and non-aligned movement ... and call on the international criminal court not to hear this case for the time being . "
china buys two-thirds of sudan 's petroleum exports and has been criticized for not using more of its leverage with the country to push for improved human rights conditions there .
european support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said sudan should respect the icc decision in the west , meanwhile , reactions varied from cautiously accepting the warrant to urging sudan to comply .
the czech presidency of the european union said wednesday it supported the international criminal court in the hague after it issued the warrant for al-bashir .
" the eu reiterates its full support and respect for the international criminal court and its key role in the promotion of international justice , " it said in a statement released wednesday evening in prague .
the czech republic noted the 2005 un security council resolution that called on sudan and other parties to cooperate with the icc in its efforts .
the czech presidency also called on the government of sudan and the darfur rebels to protect the civilian population , to respect human rights and humanitarian law .
in berlin , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called wednesday for sudan to respect the arrest warrant .
" the icc is the guarantor that serious crimes do n't remain unpunished and the victims do n't remain unredeemed .
i therefore challenge sudan to respect the decision of the icc and react in a considerate manner . "
us backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton said al-bashir can contest the warrant in washington , the us urged the sudanese government and rebel groups to show restraint in the wake of the icc decision .
" the united states is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes , " said gordon duguid , acting deputy spokesman for the state department .
secretary of state hillary clinton said : " the icc has issued an indictment based on a very long investigation and it is now in a judicial system , properly so .
" president bashir will have a chance to have his day in court .
if he believes that the indictment is wrongly charged , he can certainly contest it , " she told reporters travelling with her to brussels .
human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- also welcomed the icc arrest warrant , with the group saying it " signals that even those at the top may be held accountable for mass murder , rape and torture .
" not even presidents are guaranteed a free pass for horrific crimes , " hrw international justice program director richard dicker was quoted as saying in a statement .
un calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon has not called directly for al-bashir 's surrender un secretary general ban ki-moon called on the sudanese government on wednesday to cooperate with the joint un- african union peacekeeping mission in darfur despite the issuance of the arrest warrant against al-bashir .
in a statement in reaction to the decision , ban did not explicitly demand that khartoum surrender the sudanese leader to the icc , but called on khartoum to " address the issues of peace and justice " in a manner consistent with the 2005 resolution in which the un security council referred the case of darfur killing to the international court .
the resolution called on governments to fully cooperate with the court even if they were not signatories to the rome statute that created the icc .
ban focused his demand on the sudanese government to " fully cooperate with all un entities and their implementing partners , while fulfilling its obligation to ensure the safety and security of the civilian population , un personnel and property , and that of its implementing partners . " the secretary general calls on all parties to work in good faith toward a political solution to end the conflict in darfur , " he said in a statement .

while a chorus of arab and african states said the warrant could risk further destabilizing the fragile peace process in sudan .
in the sudanese capital khartoum , thousands of al-bashir supporters rallied in angry reaction to the decision , shouting anti-icc slogans , while the country 's government labeled the arrest warrant as " neo-colonialism , " the al-arabiya news network reported .
foreign ministry spokesman yusuf ali said al-bashir would attend an arab summit in qatar later march despite the international arrest warrant , german news agency dpa reported .
au calls for suspension on thursday , the 53-nation african union -lrb- au -rrb- said it would send a delegation to the un in new york in a bid to have the icc proceedings suspended .
" the au 's position is that we support the fight against impunity , we can not let crime perpetrators go unpunished , " au commission chairman jean ping told news agency afp .
" but we say that peace and justice should not collide , that the need for justice should not override the need for peace . "
the au leader said africa was being selectively targeted .

but germany has expressed reservations about gm 's request for european aid . the proposal for a mini-european summit from industry commissioner guenter verheugen came on the same day as gm 's auditors voiced " substantial doubt " about the parent company 's ability to stay afloat in its annual report . verheugen said thursday , march 5 , that he would like to see coordinated , european action on gm 's restructuring plans . " we need a common market not a purely national one , " he said .
" i would like to know what the various member states with gm sites are thinking of doing . " gm has said it is conducting talks for aid with the governments of all the european countries where it has factories , including germany .
in addition to opel 's activities in germany , where it has four plants , the company also has production sites in belgium , britain , poland and spain . belgium is particularly concerned that a bilateral deal between germany and gm could come at the cost of its opel factory in antwerp . the time is not right ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economics minister has reacted cautiously to proposed european talks but germany 's new economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said a european coordination summit would only make sense if gm revealed what exactly it is planning to do with its european factories and operations . " there are many issues that still have not been clarified , " guttenberg said the german government , who are still mulling opel 's request for 3.3 billion euros of financial help from european governments , also raised the pressure on opel 's management on thursday . finance minister peer steinbrueck said the restructuring plan submitted by the executives on monday did not provide an adequate basis for political decisions .

it will open to the public in october . the german government spent 200 million euros -lrb- $ 251 million -rrb- on returning the neoclassical building , which was erected on the city 's renowned museum island in 1847 , to its former glory . " you can see that it 's worth investing here and making the museum island a focus of culture in berlin , " the city 's mayor klaus wowereit said , adding that the building 's completion represented " a great day for culture around the world . " with the neues museum 's completion , only one institution on berlin 's museum island remains unfinished .
the altes nationalgalerie was renovated in 2001 and work on the bode museum was completed five years later .
the pergamon museum and the altes museum are due to be restored by 2026 . " the opening marks an important day for the museum island but also for berlin and the whole of germany , " hermann parzinger , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation which manages regional museums , told reporters . home to egyptian collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of nefertiti will receive a hall of its own in the museum the neues museum , which will open to the public in october , will house the archaeological collections of the capital 's egyptian museum including the 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti , which will have its own hall . " after 11 years , i 'm a little reluctant to hand over the keys today , " joked said british star architect david chipperfield , who won a competition to restore the building in 1997 . the island in the spree river is located in what used to be communist east germany and was not the subject of major renovation until the berlin wall fell 20 years ago .
the renovation of the island 's institutions has cost about 1 billion euros and the government is slated to spend another 500 million on related projects by 2025 . museum 's ' strange chronology ' unesco named the museum island a world cultural heritage site in 1999 and german officials have said that when completed the site will rival paris ' louvre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes visitors will flock to the newly completed museum the neues museum , which got its name because it was built shortly after the city 's old museum , is roughly rectangular , with high ceilings creating a light and airy atmosphere .
one of the building 's focal points is a grand staircase , which leads to the top floors and is a lasting monument to its first architect , friedrich august stueler . " the architecture is special because it is subtle enough not to cast a shadow over the historical artifacts exhibited , " joerg haspel , from berlin 's department for the preservation of historical monuments , explained . chipperfield said the project had a " strange chronology " because the project had required him to work with material that had largely remained untouched for 60 years . the architect , who has offices in london , berlin and milan , also said that he had tried to " capture the damage of war and the 60 years following . " according to local media reports , berlin city authorities hope the completed museum island project will attract up to four million visitors a year . sms / afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , other regions of the uk , like the midlands and the north of england , can expect contractions of up to 4 % .
the level of unemployment in northern ireland is also the lowest of any of the regions of the united kingdom .
this was despite the largest annual increase in unemployment since 1971 , with the jobless total up by 7,400 in the final three months of the year and by 14,700 over the full year .
there are warnings , however , that the local economy could shrink further as the recession deepens and the banking crisis continues .

the latest pwc uk and northern ireland economic outlook report forecast the ni economy would decline by 3 % in 2009 .
however , other regions of the uk , like the midlands and the north of england , can expect contractions of up to 4 % .
the level of unemployment in northern ireland is also the lowest of any of the regions of the united kingdom .
this was despite the largest annual increase in unemployment since 1971 , with the jobless total up by 7,400 in the final three months of the year and by 14,700 over the full year .
there are warnings , however , that the local economy could shrink further as the recession deepens and the banking crisis continues .
the report also suggested that although northern ireland average house prices fell by 28 per cent in 2008 - the worst slump since the 1980s - the end may be in sight .

mr mcdonagh added that there were " some reasons to be cheerful in the midst of all the gloom " .
" we do have a lower sterling / euro exchange rate , a weaker sterling , which is not good news for those of us who can afford to go on holiday but it is good news for the tourist trade because we 're a lower cost destination .

it would be a year before the miners returned to work following a bitter , violent dispute .
the miners ' strike started when the national coal board announced on 5 march , 1984 , the closure of cortonwood pit near barnsley in south yorkshire .
days later , miners ' unions were told of a wide-ranging pit closure programme .
by 12 march , scottish miners had joined the action and half of britain 's 187,000 pitmen had downed tools .
strike roots the roots of the strike were deeper than the initial dispute between the national coal board and the national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- in the spring of 1984 .
a decade earlier , a coal strike had helped to bring down ted heath 's conservative government and , by 1984 and just five years into her premiership , margaret thatcher was determined she would not suffer the same fate .
but a nationalised coal industry which needed large subsidies was at odds with the thatcher government 's vision for economic change .
knowing a confrontation with the powerful and hostile num would eventually come , margaret thatcher appointed ian mcgregor as head of the coal board .
coal was stockpiled at power stations so any action would have to go on for months before the country 's energy supply could be held to ransom .
not only had the government been prepared for action , the num , under the leadership of firebrand arthur scargill , was ready to stand its ground .
have your say " union leaders are just as bad as politicians , they use people for their own agenda rather than the greater good . "

it would be a year before the miners returned to work following a bitter , violent dispute .
the miners ' strike started when the national coal board announced on 5 march , 1984 , the closure of cortonwood pit near barnsley in south yorkshire .
days later , miners ' unions were told of a wide-ranging pit closure programme .
by 12 march , scottish miners had joined the action and half of britain 's 187,000 pitmen had downed tools .

coal was stockpiled at power stations so any action would have to go on for months before the country 's energy supply could be held to ransom .
