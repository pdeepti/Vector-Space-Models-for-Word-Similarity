program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.07.2009 germans debate retirement at 69 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the population ages , working lives are getting longer suggestions that germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is advocating raising the retirement age to 69 , have provoked a storm of controversy just as the country slows down for summer vacation . just as many germans are beginning their long-awaited summer breaks from their jobs , a political hot potato has been thrown into the public arena : retirement at age 69 .
no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.07.2009 germans debate retirement at 69 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the population ages , working lives are getting longer suggestions that germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is advocating raising the retirement age to 69 , have provoked a storm of controversy just as the country slows down for summer vacation . just as many germans are beginning their long-awaited summer breaks from their jobs , a political hot potato has been thrown into the public arena : retirement at age 69 .
no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

1 . " this is unacceptable , " the unnamed worker said , adding that the pay cut was not being offset by a reduction in working hours or a limited guarantee of ongoing employment - measures daimler offered its internal workforce as compensation for sacrificing pay under a cost-cutting program launched in april daimler confirmed that one-sided pay cuts were being introduced at protics , a data management offshoot that employs some 360 workers in the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .
she added that it was up to each subsidiary to decide which measures were most appropriate . sje / afp / dpa / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .

we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .

creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .

" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit .

" this is unacceptable , " the unnamed worker said , adding that the pay cut was not being offset by a reduction in working hours or a limited guarantee of ongoing employment - measures daimler offered its internal workforce as compensation for sacrificing pay under a cost-cutting program launched in april daimler confirmed that one-sided pay cuts were being introduced at protics , a data management offshoot that employs some 360 workers in the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .
she added that it was up to each subsidiary to decide which measures were most appropriate . sje / afp / dpa / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .

many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .

as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .

that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.07.2009 ethnic unrest in xinjiang - quo vadis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take more than military might to end unrest in xinjiang historic and short-term factors provoked recent unrest in china , and there is no quick solution to the conflict .
more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .
any sustainable political solution for xinjiang would have to respect the needs of uighurs as well as those of the other minorities and the han chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris fischer is an economist at the german development institute to ease the conflict and to establish a literally harmonious society , more social justice and cultural integration among the ethnic groups involved would be needed .
this will hardly be achieved by the increased military forces that currently appease the situation in urumqi .
future integration policies will have to be more inclusive and participatory , integrating the indigenous population more actively in public and governmental institutions . in the long run , political stability for xinjiang can only be envisaged in the context of a changed national political environment based on institutions that guaranty far reaching transparency , extended political rights as well as fair mechanisms of distribution and reconcilement of social interests . authors : julia bader , dr. doris fischer editor : sean sinico julia bader is a political scientist in the " governance , statehood , security " department at the german development institute .
dr. doris fischer is an economist in the institute 's " competitiveness and social development " department . based in bonn , the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik die -rrb- draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .
any sustainable political solution for xinjiang would have to respect the needs of uighurs as well as those of the other minorities and the han chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris fischer is an economist at the german development institute to ease the conflict and to establish a literally harmonious society , more social justice and cultural integration among the ethnic groups involved would be needed .
this will hardly be achieved by the increased military forces that currently appease the situation in urumqi .
future integration policies will have to be more inclusive and participatory , integrating the indigenous population more actively in public and governmental institutions . in the long run , political stability for xinjiang can only be envisaged in the context of a changed national political environment based on institutions that guaranty far reaching transparency , extended political rights as well as fair mechanisms of distribution and reconcilement of social interests . authors : julia bader , dr. doris fischer editor : sean sinico julia bader is a political scientist in the " governance , statehood , security " department at the german development institute .

the 55-year-old patient hopes to get back on a tractor - and a motorcycle - soon . after losing both of his arms when he fell into a harvester in 2002 , karl merk underwent a 15-hour operation in munich where a team of 40 surgeons attached a pair of donated arms . following many hours of physiotherapy , the 55-year-old merk waved his arms and scratched his head with the support of braces or bandages at a press conference on wednesday . asked if he was able to drink a glass of beer in typical bavarian fashion , merk said , " well , yeah , at the moment i 'm drinking from a straw otherwise it would be a bit dangerous but it should happen soon . " doctors had originally thought it would take up to two years for his nerves to regrow enough for him to move them . " the regeneration of the transplant is very gratifying , " said merk 's specialist , professor hans-gunther machens , adding that he would like to establish a center for limb reconstruction with other clinics in the future . back to the farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merk is the only person to receive two arm transplants doctors said it could take another year until merk gains complete control over the arms , and when that happens , the bavarian said he hopes to return to farming . for a number of years surgeons have been able to re-attach fingers , hands and partial arms , or to graft donated limbs on to a patient .
merk 's case , however , is the first where two complete donor arms have been attached . merk , from allgaeu in southern germany , was given hope for new arms in july 2008 , when the family of a recently deceased male who matched his age , skin color , size and blood group , agreed to donate the limbs that would replace the prosthetics he had used since the accident . unbelievable progress surgeons then battled against time to attach the arms , only to find that the new limbs were slightly longer than merk 's had been .
doctors at the munich university clinic then whittled down the bone to fit . " at the beginning , i did n't dare to believe it , " merk told reporters .
" the first three or four weeks were hard , but i would do it again straightaway . " when i manage to get back on to my motorcycle and ride , that 's going to be great , " he added . the clinic said merk 's nerve cells then slowly grew back to connect with the donated arms , and that drugs he will have to take for the rest of his life helped him survive the " rejection phase , " when his body could have had an adverse reaction to the new limbs . " it is our intention today to show people , who may have a similar handicap ... what is possible in certain circumstances , " said christoph hoehnke , the head of the transplant team .

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy .

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .

the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.07.2009 eu to continue monitoring reforms in bulgaria , romania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest -lrb- pictured -rrb- and sofia still have a long way to go bulgaria and romania need to work harder on fighting corruption and organized crime , and step up the pace of reforms says the european commission , which has decided to monitor the two states for at least another year . european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said supervising the european union 's two youngest members is a system that produces results - just not all the necessary ones .
" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.07.2009 german man plans to return to farming after successful double arm transplant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors are impressed with the speed of merk 's recovery a german farmer who lost both arms in an accident is able to raise his arms a year after a groundbreaking transplant operation .
the 55-year-old patient hopes to get back on a tractor - and a motorcycle - soon . after losing both of his arms when he fell into a harvester in 2002 , karl merk underwent a 15-hour operation in munich where a team of 40 surgeons attached a pair of donated arms . following many hours of physiotherapy , the 55-year-old merk waved his arms and scratched his head with the support of braces or bandages at a press conference on wednesday . asked if he was able to drink a glass of beer in typical bavarian fashion , merk said , " well , yeah , at the moment i 'm drinking from a straw otherwise it would be a bit dangerous but it should happen soon . " doctors had originally thought it would take up to two years for his nerves to regrow enough for him to move them . " the regeneration of the transplant is very gratifying , " said merk 's specialist , professor hans-gunther machens , adding that he would like to establish a center for limb reconstruction with other clinics in the future . back to the farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merk is the only person to receive two arm transplants doctors said it could take another year until merk gains complete control over the arms , and when that happens , the bavarian said he hopes to return to farming . for a number of years surgeons have been able to re-attach fingers , hands and partial arms , or to graft donated limbs on to a patient .
merk 's case , however , is the first where two complete donor arms have been attached . merk , from allgaeu in southern germany , was given hope for new arms in july 2008 , when the family of a recently deceased male who matched his age , skin color , size and blood group , agreed to donate the limbs that would replace the prosthetics he had used since the accident . unbelievable progress surgeons then battled against time to attach the arms , only to find that the new limbs were slightly longer than merk 's had been .
doctors at the munich university clinic then whittled down the bone to fit . " at the beginning , i did n't dare to believe it , " merk told reporters .
" the first three or four weeks were hard , but i would do it again straightaway . " when i manage to get back on to my motorcycle and ride , that 's going to be great , " he added . the clinic said merk 's nerve cells then slowly grew back to connect with the donated arms , and that drugs he will have to take for the rest of his life helped him survive the " rejection phase , " when his body could have had an adverse reaction to the new limbs . " it is our intention today to show people , who may have a similar handicap ... what is possible in certain circumstances , " said christoph hoehnke , the head of the transplant team .
" mr. merk is much further along than we thought he would be ... he was a fantastic patient . " sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .
" the impact on the cost of doing business will be huge . " bildunterschrift : seacom is one of three projects bringing high-speed internet access to eastern africa the seacom connection , which is based in mauritius and 77 percent african-owned , will have a capacity of 1.2 terabytes per second .
that is roughly enough to transmit 300,000 digital photos a second . a pair of other high-capacity undersea connections to eastern africa is also in the construction stages .
a project known as teams , which is partially funded by the kenyan government , is also scheduled to start by the end of 2009 and will connect mombasa to the united arab emirates .
the third project , the east african submarine cable system , is financed by both public and private bodies and runs from sudan to south africa . the arrival of three broadband providers should benefit africans , stork said . " there is some duplication , but it has led to reductions in cost everywhere else in the world , so we actually want to have the competition , " he said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 55-year-old patient hopes to get back on a tractor - and a motorcycle - soon . after losing both of his arms when he fell into a harvester in 2002 , karl merk underwent a 15-hour operation in munich where a team of 40 surgeons attached a pair of donated arms . following many hours of physiotherapy , the 55-year-old merk waved his arms and scratched his head with the support of braces or bandages at a press conference on wednesday . asked if he was able to drink a glass of beer in typical bavarian fashion , merk said , " well , yeah , at the moment i 'm drinking from a straw otherwise it would be a bit dangerous but it should happen soon . " doctors had originally thought it would take up to two years for his nerves to regrow enough for him to move them . " the regeneration of the transplant is very gratifying , " said merk 's specialist , professor hans-gunther machens , adding that he would like to establish a center for limb reconstruction with other clinics in the future . back to the farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merk is the only person to receive two arm transplants doctors said it could take another year until merk gains complete control over the arms , and when that happens , the bavarian said he hopes to return to farming . for a number of years surgeons have been able to re-attach fingers , hands and partial arms , or to graft donated limbs on to a patient .
merk 's case , however , is the first where two complete donor arms have been attached . merk , from allgaeu in southern germany , was given hope for new arms in july 2008 , when the family of a recently deceased male who matched his age , skin color , size and blood group , agreed to donate the limbs that would replace the prosthetics he had used since the accident . unbelievable progress surgeons then battled against time to attach the arms , only to find that the new limbs were slightly longer than merk 's had been .
doctors at the munich university clinic then whittled down the bone to fit . " at the beginning , i did n't dare to believe it , " merk told reporters .
" the first three or four weeks were hard , but i would do it again straightaway . " when i manage to get back on to my motorcycle and ride , that 's going to be great , " he added . the clinic said merk 's nerve cells then slowly grew back to connect with the donated arms , and that drugs he will have to take for the rest of his life helped him survive the " rejection phase , " when his body could have had an adverse reaction to the new limbs . " it is our intention today to show people , who may have a similar handicap ... what is possible in certain circumstances , " said christoph hoehnke , the head of the transplant team .
" mr. merk is much further along than we thought he would be ... he was a fantastic patient . " sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 22.07.2009 europe 's summer arts festivals stave off finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreux festival in switzerland was an even bigger success than last year summer festivals are in full swing across europe , with many events proving to be as popular as ever despite fears that the economic crisis would keep people away . at the 43rd montreux music festival , prices of up to 315 euros -lrb- $ 448 -rrb- per seat did not prevent tickets for two concerts by prince from selling out in eight minutes .
organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elections are set to take place on august 20 and solana made a point to meet with some of the candidates in kabul .
speaking to reporters after his talks , he emphasized that the outcome of the election belonged to the voters of afghanistan and not to the eu .
" i think it 's important to meet with some of them , to pass on a clear message that the future president of your country will be the one you decide .

the taliban suicide bombers were mostly dressed as women , hiding suicide vests and rifles underneath their burkas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.07.2009 eu to continue monitoring reforms in bulgaria , romania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest -lrb- pictured -rrb- and sofia still have a long way to go bulgaria and romania need to work harder on fighting corruption and organized crime , and step up the pace of reforms says the european commission , which has decided to monitor the two states for at least another year . european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said supervising the european union 's two youngest members is a system that produces results - just not all the necessary ones .
" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 22.07.2009 new books to explain new german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new duden is one of two major language reference books to appear in the last few days how should a german know what a " bad bank " is ?
but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .
" the impact on the cost of doing business will be huge . " bildunterschrift : seacom is one of three projects bringing high-speed internet access to eastern africa the seacom connection , which is based in mauritius and 77 percent african-owned , will have a capacity of 1.2 terabytes per second .
that is roughly enough to transmit 300,000 digital photos a second . a pair of other high-capacity undersea connections to eastern africa is also in the construction stages .
a project known as teams , which is partially funded by the kenyan government , is also scheduled to start by the end of 2009 and will connect mombasa to the united arab emirates .
the third project , the east african submarine cable system , is financed by both public and private bodies and runs from sudan to south africa . the arrival of three broadband providers should benefit africans , stork said . " there is some duplication , but it has led to reductions in cost everywhere else in the world , so we actually want to have the competition , " he said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the festival needs to redefine itself , he told dw . stephan moesch is an expert on wagner and the editor-in-chief of opernwelt -lrb- world of opera -rrb- , a prominent german trade journal . deutsche welle : the new directors of the bayreuth festival - katharina wagner and eva wagner- pasquier - took up their posts with the intention of modernizing the opera festival and lending it a more contemporary flair .
is there a new artistic concept to go along with it ? stephan moesch : there is still a real need to redefine bayreuth in this day and age .
the two half-sisters who are now directing have not had a chance to even present such a concept .
they just signed their contracts a few weeks ago and it 's still unclear which direction they want to take with the festival . is there a theme or a strategy for the next few years ?
is it already clear which artists they will want to work with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirill petrenko will conduct at bayreuth in 2013 , the 200th anniversary of wagner 's birth yes - and that 's new for bayreuth .
as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .
-lrb- editors ' note : 2013 marks the 200th anniversary of richard wagner 's birth . -rrb- before that , christian thielemann will conduct " der fliegende hollaender " and " tristan und isolde . "
that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .
how have the two festival directors been received up to now - what are your first impressions ? katharina wagner has been distinguishing herself as a director ; she just staged " tannhaeuser " on the spanish island of gran canaria - a very successful , unusual scenic rendering of this work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- l -rrb- and eva wagner-pasquier have taken the reins on the green hill eva wagner-pasquier has emerged as a casting director in aix-en-provence and at the opera bastille in paris .
she placed a lot of emphasis on lighter voices there .
but that 's not necessarily desirable at bayreuth .
we 'll see how the two will be able to complement each other . i would like to see the necessity of the bayreuth festival fundamentally redefined again .
a new staging each year with the expectation that it 's wagner " at his best " is not enough to take the festival into the future . how should the festival distinguish itself in the future ? i would like to see wagner 's compositional legacy play a greater role - that his works are not only staged differently , but that they also reflect the context in which wagner lived and worked and are confronted with new ways of listening . what kind of new things are planned that are not directly connected to the repertoire ? the new directors are now trying to establish an academy in bayreuth .
but that is only an idea right now - to create an academy where the next generation of singers can be trained , where orchestra musicians also teach and the instrumentalists prepare .
these are plans which have not yet been realized for financial reasons . interview : gudrun stegen -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rights groups and the slain journalist 's family have condemned the retrial , instead calling for an entirely new investigation into the journalist 's murder .

the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .

and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .

is there a new artistic concept to go along with it ? stephan moesch : there is still a real need to redefine bayreuth in this day and age .
the two half-sisters who are now directing have not had a chance to even present such a concept .
they just signed their contracts a few weeks ago and it 's still unclear which direction they want to take with the festival . is there a theme or a strategy for the next few years ?
is it already clear which artists they will want to work with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirill petrenko will conduct at bayreuth in 2013 , the 200th anniversary of wagner 's birth yes - and that 's new for bayreuth .
as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .
-lrb- editors ' note : 2013 marks the 200th anniversary of richard wagner 's birth . -rrb- before that , christian thielemann will conduct " der fliegende hollaender " and " tristan und isolde . "
that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .
how have the two festival directors been received up to now - what are your first impressions ? katharina wagner has been distinguishing herself as a director ; she just staged " tannhaeuser " on the spanish island of gran canaria - a very successful , unusual scenic rendering of this work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- l -rrb- and eva wagner-pasquier have taken the reins on the green hill eva wagner-pasquier has emerged as a casting director in aix-en-provence and at the opera bastille in paris .
she placed a lot of emphasis on lighter voices there .
but that 's not necessarily desirable at bayreuth .
we 'll see how the two will be able to complement each other . i would like to see the necessity of the bayreuth festival fundamentally redefined again .
a new staging each year with the expectation that it 's wagner " at his best " is not enough to take the festival into the future . how should the festival distinguish itself in the future ? i would like to see wagner 's compositional legacy play a greater role - that his works are not only staged differently , but that they also reflect the context in which wagner lived and worked and are confronted with new ways of listening . what kind of new things are planned that are not directly connected to the repertoire ? the new directors are now trying to establish an academy in bayreuth .
but that is only an idea right now - to create an academy where the next generation of singers can be trained , where orchestra musicians also teach and the instrumentalists prepare .

5 , the politkovskaya family lawyer has confirmed . the fresh preliminary hearings were ordered after russia 's supreme court annulled a moscow district military court acquittal handed to three men who had been put on trial over politkovskaya 's murder .
rights groups and the slain journalist 's family have condemned the retrial , instead calling for an entirely new investigation into the journalist 's murder .
the politkovskaya family lawyer , anna stavitskaya , has said she would demand in the upcoming preliminary hearings that the case be returned to prosecutors so that a new investigation could be carried out .
the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .

the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .
7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 22.07.2009 new books to explain new german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new duden is one of two major language reference books to appear in the last few days how should a german know what a " bad bank " is ?
but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : a new era in bayreuth the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era dark history still haunts bayreuth festival wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ? classical -pipe- 22.07.2009 a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner 's legacy lives on at the bayreuth festival wagner expert stephan moesch says there is a lot of change in store at the bayreuth festival in the coming years , includes up-and-coming conductors .
but the festival needs to redefine itself , he told dw . stephan moesch is an expert on wagner and the editor-in-chief of opernwelt -lrb- world of opera -rrb- , a prominent german trade journal . deutsche welle : the new directors of the bayreuth festival - katharina wagner and eva wagner- pasquier - took up their posts with the intention of modernizing the opera festival and lending it a more contemporary flair .
is there a new artistic concept to go along with it ? stephan moesch : there is still a real need to redefine bayreuth in this day and age .
the two half-sisters who are now directing have not had a chance to even present such a concept .
they just signed their contracts a few weeks ago and it 's still unclear which direction they want to take with the festival . is there a theme or a strategy for the next few years ?
is it already clear which artists they will want to work with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirill petrenko will conduct at bayreuth in 2013 , the 200th anniversary of wagner 's birth yes - and that 's new for bayreuth .
as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .
-lrb- editors ' note : 2013 marks the 200th anniversary of richard wagner 's birth . -rrb- before that , christian thielemann will conduct " der fliegende hollaender " and " tristan und isolde . "
that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .
how have the two festival directors been received up to now - what are your first impressions ? katharina wagner has been distinguishing herself as a director ; she just staged " tannhaeuser " on the spanish island of gran canaria - a very successful , unusual scenic rendering of this work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- l -rrb- and eva wagner-pasquier have taken the reins on the green hill eva wagner-pasquier has emerged as a casting director in aix-en-provence and at the opera bastille in paris .
she placed a lot of emphasis on lighter voices there .
but that 's not necessarily desirable at bayreuth .
we 'll see how the two will be able to complement each other . i would like to see the necessity of the bayreuth festival fundamentally redefined again .
a new staging each year with the expectation that it 's wagner " at his best " is not enough to take the festival into the future . how should the festival distinguish itself in the future ? i would like to see wagner 's compositional legacy play a greater role - that his works are not only staged differently , but that they also reflect the context in which wagner lived and worked and are confronted with new ways of listening . what kind of new things are planned that are not directly connected to the repertoire ? the new directors are now trying to establish an academy in bayreuth .
but that is only an idea right now - to create an academy where the next generation of singers can be trained , where orchestra musicians also teach and the instrumentalists prepare .
these are plans which have not yet been realized for financial reasons . interview : gudrun stegen -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american swimmer andrew gemmell came in second , with his team-mate francis crippen finishing third in front of italian swimmer valerio cleri .
another italian swimmer simone ercoli had to be taken away on a stretcher to an ambulance , apparently suffering from exhaustion .
lurz finished the course in a time of 1hr 52min 06.9sec to win his third 10km title .
" during the 10km you have a lot of time to think , it 's only when you see the blue board that you stop thinking and start giving everything you have , " lurz said .

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.07.2009 ethnic unrest in xinjiang - quo vadis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take more than military might to end unrest in xinjiang historic and short-term factors provoked recent unrest in china , and there is no quick solution to the conflict .
more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .
any sustainable political solution for xinjiang would have to respect the needs of uighurs as well as those of the other minorities and the han chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris fischer is an economist at the german development institute to ease the conflict and to establish a literally harmonious society , more social justice and cultural integration among the ethnic groups involved would be needed .

more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .
any sustainable political solution for xinjiang would have to respect the needs of uighurs as well as those of the other minorities and the han chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris fischer is an economist at the german development institute to ease the conflict and to establish a literally harmonious society , more social justice and cultural integration among the ethnic groups involved would be needed .

the taliban suicide bombers were mostly dressed as women , hiding suicide vests and rifles underneath their burkas .
despite the increase in violence , solana said the elections must take place as scheduled .
" so we 're talking about a country which has problems with security that has a democratically elected president and a constitution that compels every five years to produce elections for the president , " he said .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.07.2009 electric cars start buzzing down berlin streets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is booming as a test ground for electric cars when it comes to electric mobility , the german capital is fast becoming the preferred testing ground for european companies to show off their newest technology .
bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

5 , the politkovskaya family lawyer has confirmed . the fresh preliminary hearings were ordered after russia 's supreme court annulled a moscow district military court acquittal handed to three men who had been put on trial over politkovskaya 's murder .
rights groups and the slain journalist 's family have condemned the retrial , instead calling for an entirely new investigation into the journalist 's murder .
the politkovskaya family lawyer , anna stavitskaya , has said she would demand in the upcoming preliminary hearings that the case be returned to prosecutors so that a new investigation could be carried out .
the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address .
the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .
7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .
news of the new trial comes a week after the killing of human rights activist natalya estemirova who , like politkovskaya , had reported on crimes against civilians in chechnya. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 22.07.2009 new books to explain new german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new duden is one of two major language reference books to appear in the last few days how should a german know what a " bad bank " is ?
but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

1 . " this is unacceptable , " the unnamed worker said , adding that the pay cut was not being offset by a reduction in working hours or a limited guarantee of ongoing employment - measures daimler offered its internal workforce as compensation for sacrificing pay under a cost-cutting program launched in april daimler confirmed that one-sided pay cuts were being introduced at protics , a data management offshoot that employs some 360 workers in the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .

the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.07.2009 electric cars start buzzing down berlin streets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is booming as a test ground for electric cars when it comes to electric mobility , the german capital is fast becoming the preferred testing ground for european companies to show off their newest technology .
bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.07.2009 electric cars start buzzing down berlin streets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is booming as a test ground for electric cars when it comes to electric mobility , the german capital is fast becoming the preferred testing ground for european companies to show off their newest technology .
bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .

but the festival needs to redefine itself , he told dw . stephan moesch is an expert on wagner and the editor-in-chief of opernwelt -lrb- world of opera -rrb- , a prominent german trade journal . deutsche welle : the new directors of the bayreuth festival - katharina wagner and eva wagner- pasquier - took up their posts with the intention of modernizing the opera festival and lending it a more contemporary flair .
is there a new artistic concept to go along with it ? stephan moesch : there is still a real need to redefine bayreuth in this day and age .
the two half-sisters who are now directing have not had a chance to even present such a concept .
they just signed their contracts a few weeks ago and it 's still unclear which direction they want to take with the festival . is there a theme or a strategy for the next few years ?
is it already clear which artists they will want to work with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirill petrenko will conduct at bayreuth in 2013 , the 200th anniversary of wagner 's birth yes - and that 's new for bayreuth .
as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .
-lrb- editors ' note : 2013 marks the 200th anniversary of richard wagner 's birth . -rrb- before that , christian thielemann will conduct " der fliegende hollaender " and " tristan und isolde . "
that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .
how have the two festival directors been received up to now - what are your first impressions ? katharina wagner has been distinguishing herself as a director ; she just staged " tannhaeuser " on the spanish island of gran canaria - a very successful , unusual scenic rendering of this work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- l -rrb- and eva wagner-pasquier have taken the reins on the green hill eva wagner-pasquier has emerged as a casting director in aix-en-provence and at the opera bastille in paris .
she placed a lot of emphasis on lighter voices there .
but that 's not necessarily desirable at bayreuth .
we 'll see how the two will be able to complement each other . i would like to see the necessity of the bayreuth festival fundamentally redefined again .
a new staging each year with the expectation that it 's wagner " at his best " is not enough to take the festival into the future . how should the festival distinguish itself in the future ? i would like to see wagner 's compositional legacy play a greater role - that his works are not only staged differently , but that they also reflect the context in which wagner lived and worked and are confronted with new ways of listening . what kind of new things are planned that are not directly connected to the repertoire ? the new directors are now trying to establish an academy in bayreuth .
but that is only an idea right now - to create an academy where the next generation of singers can be trained , where orchestra musicians also teach and the instrumentalists prepare .
these are plans which have not yet been realized for financial reasons . interview : gudrun stegen -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 22.07.2009 new books to explain new german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new duden is one of two major language reference books to appear in the last few days how should a german know what a " bad bank " is ?
but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.07.2009 germans debate retirement at 69 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the population ages , working lives are getting longer suggestions that germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is advocating raising the retirement age to 69 , have provoked a storm of controversy just as the country slows down for summer vacation . just as many germans are beginning their long-awaited summer breaks from their jobs , a political hot potato has been thrown into the public arena : retirement at age 69 .
no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .
" the impact on the cost of doing business will be huge . " bildunterschrift : seacom is one of three projects bringing high-speed internet access to eastern africa the seacom connection , which is based in mauritius and 77 percent african-owned , will have a capacity of 1.2 terabytes per second .
that is roughly enough to transmit 300,000 digital photos a second . a pair of other high-capacity undersea connections to eastern africa is also in the construction stages .
a project known as teams , which is partially funded by the kenyan government , is also scheduled to start by the end of 2009 and will connect mombasa to the united arab emirates .
the third project , the east african submarine cable system , is financed by both public and private bodies and runs from sudan to south africa . the arrival of three broadband providers should benefit africans , stork said . " there is some duplication , but it has led to reductions in cost everywhere else in the world , so we actually want to have the competition , " he said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.07.2009 germans debate retirement at 69 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the population ages , working lives are getting longer suggestions that germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is advocating raising the retirement age to 69 , have provoked a storm of controversy just as the country slows down for summer vacation . just as many germans are beginning their long-awaited summer breaks from their jobs , a political hot potato has been thrown into the public arena : retirement at age 69 .
no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , the politkovskaya family lawyer has confirmed . the fresh preliminary hearings were ordered after russia 's supreme court annulled a moscow district military court acquittal handed to three men who had been put on trial over politkovskaya 's murder .
rights groups and the slain journalist 's family have condemned the retrial , instead calling for an entirely new investigation into the journalist 's murder .
the politkovskaya family lawyer , anna stavitskaya , has said she would demand in the upcoming preliminary hearings that the case be returned to prosecutors so that a new investigation could be carried out .
the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address .
the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .
7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .

the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address .
the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .

many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

1 . " this is unacceptable , " the unnamed worker said , adding that the pay cut was not being offset by a reduction in working hours or a limited guarantee of ongoing employment - measures daimler offered its internal workforce as compensation for sacrificing pay under a cost-cutting program launched in april daimler confirmed that one-sided pay cuts were being introduced at protics , a data management offshoot that employs some 360 workers in the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .
she added that it was up to each subsidiary to decide which measures were most appropriate . sje / afp / dpa / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .

but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .

the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?

but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.07.2009 eu to continue monitoring reforms in bulgaria , romania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest -lrb- pictured -rrb- and sofia still have a long way to go bulgaria and romania need to work harder on fighting corruption and organized crime , and step up the pace of reforms says the european commission , which has decided to monitor the two states for at least another year . european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said supervising the european union 's two youngest members is a system that produces results - just not all the necessary ones .
" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.07.2009 germans debate retirement at 69 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the population ages , working lives are getting longer suggestions that germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is advocating raising the retirement age to 69 , have provoked a storm of controversy just as the country slows down for summer vacation . just as many germans are beginning their long-awaited summer breaks from their jobs , a political hot potato has been thrown into the public arena : retirement at age 69 .
no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.07.2009 ethnic unrest in xinjiang - quo vadis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take more than military might to end unrest in xinjiang historic and short-term factors provoked recent unrest in china , and there is no quick solution to the conflict .
more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .
any sustainable political solution for xinjiang would have to respect the needs of uighurs as well as those of the other minorities and the han chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris fischer is an economist at the german development institute to ease the conflict and to establish a literally harmonious society , more social justice and cultural integration among the ethnic groups involved would be needed .
this will hardly be achieved by the increased military forces that currently appease the situation in urumqi .
future integration policies will have to be more inclusive and participatory , integrating the indigenous population more actively in public and governmental institutions . in the long run , political stability for xinjiang can only be envisaged in the context of a changed national political environment based on institutions that guaranty far reaching transparency , extended political rights as well as fair mechanisms of distribution and reconcilement of social interests . authors : julia bader , dr. doris fischer editor : sean sinico julia bader is a political scientist in the " governance , statehood , security " department at the german development institute .

ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.07.2009 electric cars start buzzing down berlin streets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is booming as a test ground for electric cars when it comes to electric mobility , the german capital is fast becoming the preferred testing ground for european companies to show off their newest technology .
bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

but the festival needs to redefine itself , he told dw . stephan moesch is an expert on wagner and the editor-in-chief of opernwelt -lrb- world of opera -rrb- , a prominent german trade journal . deutsche welle : the new directors of the bayreuth festival - katharina wagner and eva wagner- pasquier - took up their posts with the intention of modernizing the opera festival and lending it a more contemporary flair .
is there a new artistic concept to go along with it ? stephan moesch : there is still a real need to redefine bayreuth in this day and age .
the two half-sisters who are now directing have not had a chance to even present such a concept .
they just signed their contracts a few weeks ago and it 's still unclear which direction they want to take with the festival . is there a theme or a strategy for the next few years ?
is it already clear which artists they will want to work with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirill petrenko will conduct at bayreuth in 2013 , the 200th anniversary of wagner 's birth yes - and that 's new for bayreuth .
as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .
-lrb- editors ' note : 2013 marks the 200th anniversary of richard wagner 's birth . -rrb- before that , christian thielemann will conduct " der fliegende hollaender " and " tristan und isolde . "
that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .
how have the two festival directors been received up to now - what are your first impressions ? katharina wagner has been distinguishing herself as a director ; she just staged " tannhaeuser " on the spanish island of gran canaria - a very successful , unusual scenic rendering of this work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- l -rrb- and eva wagner-pasquier have taken the reins on the green hill eva wagner-pasquier has emerged as a casting director in aix-en-provence and at the opera bastille in paris .
she placed a lot of emphasis on lighter voices there .
but that 's not necessarily desirable at bayreuth .
we 'll see how the two will be able to complement each other . i would like to see the necessity of the bayreuth festival fundamentally redefined again .
a new staging each year with the expectation that it 's wagner " at his best " is not enough to take the festival into the future . how should the festival distinguish itself in the future ? i would like to see wagner 's compositional legacy play a greater role - that his works are not only staged differently , but that they also reflect the context in which wagner lived and worked and are confronted with new ways of listening . what kind of new things are planned that are not directly connected to the repertoire ? the new directors are now trying to establish an academy in bayreuth .
but that is only an idea right now - to create an academy where the next generation of singers can be trained , where orchestra musicians also teach and the instrumentalists prepare .
these are plans which have not yet been realized for financial reasons . interview : gudrun stegen -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new staging each year with the expectation that it 's wagner " at his best " is not enough to take the festival into the future . how should the festival distinguish itself in the future ? i would like to see wagner 's compositional legacy play a greater role - that his works are not only staged differently , but that they also reflect the context in which wagner lived and worked and are confronted with new ways of listening . what kind of new things are planned that are not directly connected to the repertoire ? the new directors are now trying to establish an academy in bayreuth .
but that is only an idea right now - to create an academy where the next generation of singers can be trained , where orchestra musicians also teach and the instrumentalists prepare .
these are plans which have not yet been realized for financial reasons . interview : gudrun stegen -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit .

" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.07.2009 eu to continue monitoring reforms in bulgaria , romania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest -lrb- pictured -rrb- and sofia still have a long way to go bulgaria and romania need to work harder on fighting corruption and organized crime , and step up the pace of reforms says the european commission , which has decided to monitor the two states for at least another year . european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said supervising the european union 's two youngest members is a system that produces results - just not all the necessary ones .
" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .
" the impact on the cost of doing business will be huge . " bildunterschrift : seacom is one of three projects bringing high-speed internet access to eastern africa the seacom connection , which is based in mauritius and 77 percent african-owned , will have a capacity of 1.2 terabytes per second .
that is roughly enough to transmit 300,000 digital photos a second . a pair of other high-capacity undersea connections to eastern africa is also in the construction stages .
a project known as teams , which is partially funded by the kenyan government , is also scheduled to start by the end of 2009 and will connect mombasa to the united arab emirates .
the third project , the east african submarine cable system , is financed by both public and private bodies and runs from sudan to south africa . the arrival of three broadband providers should benefit africans , stork said . " there is some duplication , but it has led to reductions in cost everywhere else in the world , so we actually want to have the competition , " he said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .
" the impact on the cost of doing business will be huge . " bildunterschrift : seacom is one of three projects bringing high-speed internet access to eastern africa the seacom connection , which is based in mauritius and 77 percent african-owned , will have a capacity of 1.2 terabytes per second .
that is roughly enough to transmit 300,000 digital photos a second . a pair of other high-capacity undersea connections to eastern africa is also in the construction stages .
a project known as teams , which is partially funded by the kenyan government , is also scheduled to start by the end of 2009 and will connect mombasa to the united arab emirates .
the third project , the east african submarine cable system , is financed by both public and private bodies and runs from sudan to south africa . the arrival of three broadband providers should benefit africans , stork said . " there is some duplication , but it has led to reductions in cost everywhere else in the world , so we actually want to have the competition , " he said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.07.2009 eu to continue monitoring reforms in bulgaria , romania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest -lrb- pictured -rrb- and sofia still have a long way to go bulgaria and romania need to work harder on fighting corruption and organized crime , and step up the pace of reforms says the european commission , which has decided to monitor the two states for at least another year . european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said supervising the european union 's two youngest members is a system that produces results - just not all the necessary ones .
" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .

the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .
de prato says iceland is not the problem .
" iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of croatia , so everyone has good feelings about iceland in croatia - everybody would be happy if iceland joins , " he said .
" but with romania and bulgaria , the reaction was , you want them ?
and you do n't want us ?
come on ! "
but the commission will not be drawn into a public discussion over whether romania and bulgaria were accepted into the eu too soon .
commission officials insist , that under their close supervision , both countries will deliver on their promise to reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 22.07.2009 europe 's summer arts festivals stave off finance crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreux festival in switzerland was an even bigger success than last year summer festivals are in full swing across europe , with many events proving to be as popular as ever despite fears that the economic crisis would keep people away . at the 43rd montreux music festival , prices of up to 315 euros -lrb- $ 448 -rrb- per seat did not prevent tickets for two concerts by prince from selling out in eight minutes .
organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .

the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .

lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .

rights groups and the slain journalist 's family have condemned the retrial , instead calling for an entirely new investigation into the journalist 's murder .
the politkovskaya family lawyer , anna stavitskaya , has said she would demand in the upcoming preliminary hearings that the case be returned to prosecutors so that a new investigation could be carried out .
the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address .
the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .

many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .

5 , the politkovskaya family lawyer has confirmed . the fresh preliminary hearings were ordered after russia 's supreme court annulled a moscow district military court acquittal handed to three men who had been put on trial over politkovskaya 's murder .
rights groups and the slain journalist 's family have condemned the retrial , instead calling for an entirely new investigation into the journalist 's murder .
the politkovskaya family lawyer , anna stavitskaya , has said she would demand in the upcoming preliminary hearings that the case be returned to prosecutors so that a new investigation could be carried out .
the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address .
the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .
7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .
news of the new trial comes a week after the killing of human rights activist natalya estemirova who , like politkovskaya , had reported on crimes against civilians in chechnya. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .

the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .

experts say more access will lead to lower prices and greater use of the internet among africans . the cost of accessing internet services in africa is likely to fall in the near future with work on laying a fiber-optic cable connecting eastern and southern africa to europe and asia set to be completed by seacom on thursday . the price of access to high-speed telecommunications in africa is among the highest in the world , a fact which has kept many africans off the internet , according to christoph stork of research ict africa , which consults on information and communication technology in 19 countries on the continent . " while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .
" the impact on the cost of doing business will be huge . " bildunterschrift : seacom is one of three projects bringing high-speed internet access to eastern africa the seacom connection , which is based in mauritius and 77 percent african-owned , will have a capacity of 1.2 terabytes per second .

is there a new artistic concept to go along with it ? stephan moesch : there is still a real need to redefine bayreuth in this day and age .
the two half-sisters who are now directing have not had a chance to even present such a concept .
they just signed their contracts a few weeks ago and it 's still unclear which direction they want to take with the festival . is there a theme or a strategy for the next few years ?
is it already clear which artists they will want to work with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirill petrenko will conduct at bayreuth in 2013 , the 200th anniversary of wagner 's birth yes - and that 's new for bayreuth .
as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .

that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .

she placed a lot of emphasis on lighter voices there .
but that 's not necessarily desirable at bayreuth .
we 'll see how the two will be able to complement each other . i would like to see the necessity of the bayreuth festival fundamentally redefined again .
a new staging each year with the expectation that it 's wagner " at his best " is not enough to take the festival into the future . how should the festival distinguish itself in the future ? i would like to see wagner 's compositional legacy play a greater role - that his works are not only staged differently , but that they also reflect the context in which wagner lived and worked and are confronted with new ways of listening . what kind of new things are planned that are not directly connected to the repertoire ? the new directors are now trying to establish an academy in bayreuth .
but that is only an idea right now - to create an academy where the next generation of singers can be trained , where orchestra musicians also teach and the instrumentalists prepare .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : a new era in bayreuth the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era dark history still haunts bayreuth festival wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ? classical music -pipe- 22.07.2009 a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner 's legacy lives on at the bayreuth festival wagner expert stephan moesch says there is a lot of change in store at the bayreuth festival in the coming years , includes up-and-coming conductors .
but the festival needs to redefine itself , he told dw . stephan moesch is an expert on wagner and the editor-in-chief of opernwelt -lrb- world of opera -rrb- , a prominent german trade journal . deutsche welle : the new directors of the bayreuth festival - katharina wagner and eva wagner- pasquier - took up their posts with the intention of modernizing the opera festival and lending it a more contemporary flair .
is there a new artistic concept to go along with it ? stephan moesch : there is still a real need to redefine bayreuth in this day and age .
the two half-sisters who are now directing have not had a chance to even present such a concept .
they just signed their contracts a few weeks ago and it 's still unclear which direction they want to take with the festival . is there a theme or a strategy for the next few years ?
is it already clear which artists they will want to work with ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirill petrenko will conduct at bayreuth in 2013 , the 200th anniversary of wagner 's birth yes - and that 's new for bayreuth .
as far as the conductors are concerned , there 's a clear perspective up to 2015 .
it 's a very promising line-up .
it is mainly the middle-aged and younger generation of conductors who will be in the orchestra pit : andris nelsons , a young latvian conductor ; thomas hengelbrock , who has concentrated on the performance practices of the 18th and 19th centuries ; kirill petrenko , one of the most talented young conductors around , will be conducting " der ring des nibelungen " in anniversary year 2013 .
-lrb- editors ' note : 2013 marks the 200th anniversary of richard wagner 's birth . -rrb- before that , christian thielemann will conduct " der fliegende hollaender " and " tristan und isolde . "
that 's a really wonderful selection .
as far as the directors are concerned , the old master hans neuenfels will be involved in 2010 - a long overdue decision ; he should have directed at bayreuth 20 years ago .
and then there will be a focus on the younger generation , but a lot is still up in the air . the opera for children and the decision to open up the festival to a wider audience on the internet were two very successful ideas .
how have the two festival directors been received up to now - what are your first impressions ? katharina wagner has been distinguishing herself as a director ; she just staged " tannhaeuser " on the spanish island of gran canaria - a very successful , unusual scenic rendering of this work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- l -rrb- and eva wagner-pasquier have taken the reins on the green hill eva wagner-pasquier has emerged as a casting director in aix-en-provence and at the opera bastille in paris .
she placed a lot of emphasis on lighter voices there .
but that 's not necessarily desirable at bayreuth .
we 'll see how the two will be able to complement each other . i would like to see the necessity of the bayreuth festival fundamentally redefined again .

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

1 . " this is unacceptable , " the unnamed worker said , adding that the pay cut was not being offset by a reduction in working hours or a limited guarantee of ongoing employment - measures daimler offered its internal workforce as compensation for sacrificing pay under a cost-cutting program launched in april daimler confirmed that one-sided pay cuts were being introduced at protics , a data management offshoot that employs some 360 workers in the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .
she added that it was up to each subsidiary to decide which measures were most appropriate . sje / afp / dpa / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .

we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .

creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .

5 , the politkovskaya family lawyer has confirmed . the fresh preliminary hearings were ordered after russia 's supreme court annulled a moscow district military court acquittal handed to three men who had been put on trial over politkovskaya 's murder .
rights groups and the slain journalist 's family have condemned the retrial , instead calling for an entirely new investigation into the journalist 's murder .
the politkovskaya family lawyer , anna stavitskaya , has said she would demand in the upcoming preliminary hearings that the case be returned to prosecutors so that a new investigation could be carried out .
the military court had ruled in february that brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov were not guilty of being accessories to the murder and also cleared a former police officer , sergei khadzhikurbanov , of organizing the crime .
the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address .
the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on oct .
7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
many russians and rights organizations believe the contract-style killing was politically motivated and connected with her critical reporting on human rights conditions in chechnya .
news of the new trial comes a week after the killing of human rights activist natalya estemirova who , like politkovskaya , had reported on crimes against civilians in chechnya. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 22.07.2009 new books to explain new german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new duden is one of two major language reference books to appear in the last few days how should a german know what a " bad bank " is ?
but the word is now all over the german news .
two new editions of standard dictionaries try to help in the endless process of keeping german - and germans - up to date . " bad bank " is only one of 5,000 new entries in the new duden . " bank " is a german word , and means the same as in english , but " bad " is not so obvious . so that 's where the 25th edition of the duden dictionary comes in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever since the iranian protests began , twitter has become part of our world in the last few days , both the classic authorities on the german language , duden and wahrig , have published new editions of their reference works . new words , such as " twittern " -lrb- a german verbal form meaning " to send a message via twitter " -rrb- or " komasaufen " -lrb- " saufen " means " to drink , " " koma " means " coma , " so " komasaufen " means " binge-drinking " -rrb- reflect new social realities .
in exchange , some words have had to go . but not many people will miss " portechaise " -lrb- a french loan-word for " sedan chair " -rrb- , or " apostilb " -lrb- which means " apostilb " in english - and i bet you 'll have to look up the english word ! -rrb- . altogether , there are now 135,000 words in the duden and 130,000 in the wahrig .
each edition gets bigger and bigger : the first duden in 1880 had just 27,000 words .
computers help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german newspapers are a major source of new words once upon a time , such works were the product of endless reading ; staff would read newspapers , magazines and books and note every new word . now , says duden editor werner scholze-stubenrecht , " we 've computerized the entire annual output of many magazines and many books .
we can do a statistical analysis and determine : aha , this word is being used a lot ! "
words only get into these dictionaries if they have really become part of the german language . the head of the duden editorial team , matthias wermke , says on the company website , " we consider that they have done so if they can be found in substantial numbers in several different kinds of texts , from newspapers to literary works .
one-day wonders do n't have any place in duden . "
some words do take their time , though . " it-girl " was first used to describe clara bow in a silent film in 1927 , but it 's only just made it to duden , perhaps because it has re-emerged in english in the last few years .
creative combinations but many of the new entries are based on the wonderful german way of combining existing words to make something new .
" herdprämie " -lrb- from " herd " meaning " hearth " and " prämie " meaning " prize " -rrb- refers to the government payments made to german parents if they decide to stay at home and look after their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is president obama on a kuschelkurs with iran ?
or there 's " kuschelkurs " -lrb- from " kuscheln " meaning " cuddle " and " kurs " meaning " course " -rrb- , which refers to a policy of not being too tough with someone - so , some people might say that president obama is operating a " kuschelkurs " towards iran .
there are many who complain that duden and wahrig do not adequately protect the language from foreign influences : while new words made of german elements are acceptable , " after-show-party " or " best-of " -lrb- as in " the band has issued a new best-of collection " -rrb- are destroying the language from within .
" we 're not the police " scholze-stubenrecht says that duden is n't the language police : " people have to decide for themselves which words they use , and which they do n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's someone who is not enjoying a visit to the frisoer many words refer to things which have been imported from abroad , and the words have come with them , like " sashimi " or " chorizo . "
but , except during the rule of the nazis , germans have always been prepared to take on words from foreign languages , " restaurant " or " computer , " for example . words were often germanized in a fairly rough and ready way , like " frisoer " for the french " friseur " or " hairdresser . "
now we have " blogosphaere " for " blogosphere . "
but the real strokes of folk genius occur when a german word is mixed with a foreign word to create something which is totally new , like " urcool , " which adds german prefix " ur- , " meaning " primordial " to the well-known english colloquialism . now , how urcool is that !

1 . " this is unacceptable , " the unnamed worker said , adding that the pay cut was not being offset by a reduction in working hours or a limited guarantee of ongoing employment - measures daimler offered its internal workforce as compensation for sacrificing pay under a cost-cutting program launched in april daimler confirmed that one-sided pay cuts were being introduced at protics , a data management offshoot that employs some 360 workers in the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .
she added that it was up to each subsidiary to decide which measures were most appropriate . sje / afp / dpa / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a very promising line-up .

" while people in america were upset about bandwidth limits of 250 gigabytes a month , for mobile broadband access in south africa we would have to pay about 100 euros -lrb- $ 142 -rrb- per gigabyte , " he said . connectivity at a cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of internet access in africa is among the world 's highest ham mjulira , a former ugandan cabinet member responsible for information and communication , said he expected the cost of voice and data communication to drop by as much as 80 percent as a result of the new cable . " we 're expecting a massive drop as soon as seacom is fully operational , " stork said , adding that costs could fall by up tot 90 percent of current levels .
" it will still be much higher than what european or indian or american customers are used to , but it 's still a big drop . " once the price of connectivity falls , many more africans will turn to the internet for news , information and entertainment , stork said .
current internet penetration in africa is 5.6 percent , compared to 26.6 percent for the rest of the world , according to the internet world stats tracking site . " as soon as the cost comes down , other demands will arise that we ca n't anticipate yet , " he said .
" as soon as it 's affordable , people in africa will engage with news and information online and take part in other activities that they ca n't do now because of the cost . " but price decreases will depend on how much of the network 's capacity is used , according to a 2008 study by the association for progressive communications in south africa .
it found that the full potential of an existing cable connecting western and south africa to europe was not used , resulting in smaller price decreases than anticipated . broadband access helps solve other problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone technology is more widespread in africa than internet access investing in the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet access and making efficient use of broadband networks would benefit many african countries , according to a world bank report released at the end of june . the study showed that a 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections led to an economic growth increase of 1.3 percent .
broadband internet connections provide the basis for local information technology services , which create jobs , increase exports and promote social inclusion , the world bank said . should prices fall substantially , parts of africa could become more attractive for call centers and other industries that rely heavily on telecommunications , stork said . " south africa already has its fair share of outsourcing and ghana and kenya and uganda are benefitting from it , " stork said .
" the advantage is that much of africa is in a time zone close to the uk 's , wages are very low and they speak native english . " but with less than 15 percent of the potential market for it services being met , there is plenty of room for newcomers in the high-tech services industry , according to the report .
it estimated the total market to be nearly $ 65 billion in 2007 - a figure that estimates show could jump to $ 239 billion by 2012 . quick connections coming seacom 's high-capacity connection for eastern africa could help countries there tap into that market and change the way business is done , according to seacom president brian herlihy . " eastern africa has been the only part of the world without submarine cables connectivity , " herlihy told reporters ahead of the project 's completion .
" the impact on the cost of doing business will be huge . " bildunterschrift : seacom is one of three projects bringing high-speed internet access to eastern africa the seacom connection , which is based in mauritius and 77 percent african-owned , will have a capacity of 1.2 terabytes per second .
that is roughly enough to transmit 300,000 digital photos a second . a pair of other high-capacity undersea connections to eastern africa is also in the construction stages .
a project known as teams , which is partially funded by the kenyan government , is also scheduled to start by the end of 2009 and will connect mombasa to the united arab emirates .
the third project , the east african submarine cable system , is financed by both public and private bodies and runs from sudan to south africa . the arrival of three broadband providers should benefit africans , stork said . " there is some duplication , but it has led to reductions in cost everywhere else in the world , so we actually want to have the competition , " he said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to reporters after his talks , he emphasized that the outcome of the election belonged to the voters of afghanistan and not to the eu .
" i think it 's important to meet with some of them , to pass on a clear message that the future president of your country will be the one you decide .

the taliban suicide bombers were mostly dressed as women , hiding suicide vests and rifles underneath their burkas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.07.2009 ethnic unrest in xinjiang - quo vadis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take more than military might to end unrest in xinjiang historic and short-term factors provoked recent unrest in china , and there is no quick solution to the conflict .
more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .
any sustainable political solution for xinjiang would have to respect the needs of uighurs as well as those of the other minorities and the han chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris fischer is an economist at the german development institute to ease the conflict and to establish a literally harmonious society , more social justice and cultural integration among the ethnic groups involved would be needed .
this will hardly be achieved by the increased military forces that currently appease the situation in urumqi .
future integration policies will have to be more inclusive and participatory , integrating the indigenous population more actively in public and governmental institutions . in the long run , political stability for xinjiang can only be envisaged in the context of a changed national political environment based on institutions that guaranty far reaching transparency , extended political rights as well as fair mechanisms of distribution and reconcilement of social interests . authors : julia bader , dr. doris fischer editor : sean sinico julia bader is a political scientist in the " governance , statehood , security " department at the german development institute .
dr. doris fischer is an economist in the institute 's " competitiveness and social development " department . based in bonn , the german development institute -lrb- deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik die -rrb- draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "

the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .

no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 22.07.2009 germans debate retirement at 69 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the population ages , working lives are getting longer suggestions that germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , is advocating raising the retirement age to 69 , have provoked a storm of controversy just as the country slows down for summer vacation . just as many germans are beginning their long-awaited summer breaks from their jobs , a political hot potato has been thrown into the public arena : retirement at age 69 .
no legislators are seriously talking about drafting a bill to raise the retirement age - after all , an age hike from 65 to 67 was decided just two years ago .
and yet the comment pages of germany 's newspapers are full of outraged opinions about the effrontery of expecting people to stay at their jobs for an additional two years .
the debate stems from the latest monthly report issued by germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
in the report , the bank calculated that a further hike in the retirement age by 2060 is necessary , given the ever-longer life spans of germany 's population .
leading politicians have heavily criticized the bundesbank for starting the discussion .
an " anti-social " debate ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister olaf scholz has called the debate " nonsense " " it 's total nonsense , " said german labor minister olaf scholz -lrb- spd -rrb- , a view echoed by many conservative and opposition members .
juergen trittin , a leading member of the opposition green party , recently told german public broadcaster zdf that " such discussions only served to unsettle people . "
" it 's anti-social , " trittin concluded .
ulrike mascher , president of the country 's largest pensioner lobby group , the sozialverband vdk , said that only one in five germans currently carries on to age 65 in a job with social insurance contributions .
" retirement at 69 would represent a drastic cut to pensions through the back door , " she told the hanover paper , neue presse .
bundesbank issues clarification other politicians reminded the nation that it would be difficult enough over the next few years to successfully extend the retirement age to 67 by creating enough jobs for seniors , without embarking on a new discussion about raising the age even further .
all of this has led the bundesbank to issue a clarification of its report .
on tuesday , a statement from the bank denied suggestions that it had called for a rise in the retirement age .
it had merely explained the correlation with the country 's demographic development .
" the article in the monthly report presents the calculable consequences of this correlation as an ' if-then ' scenario , without evaluating the situation politically , " the statement said .
but some experts have welcomed the debate sparked by the bundesbank 's report .
the freiburg-based economist bernd raffelhueschen , for example , said the country must n't shy away from an important discussion .
" at its core , it 's about the question of if and how our society is preparing itself for a population with increasing life expectancy , " he told the kölner stadtanzeiger .
" retirement at 67 is due to be reviewed in the coming year , and we have to ask ourselves if employees even have a chance of staying in the labor market for such a long time , " he said. dc / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.07.2009 electric cars start buzzing down berlin streets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is booming as a test ground for electric cars when it comes to electric mobility , the german capital is fast becoming the preferred testing ground for european companies to show off their newest technology .
bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season .

just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .

bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.07.2009 electric cars start buzzing down berlin streets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is booming as a test ground for electric cars when it comes to electric mobility , the german capital is fast becoming the preferred testing ground for european companies to show off their newest technology .
bmw and daimler are both testing vehicles in berlin . in berlin , 100 residents have climbed behind the wheel to test the performance of the electric version of bmw 's mini cooper , called the mini-e , in an urban environment . " i 've been driving the mini-e around berlin for five weeks and it is an amazing experience , " said frank mueller , one of the test drivers .
" first off , it is a very fast car . " the two-seater can reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 mph -rrb- in seconds , mueller said , adding that the vehicle 's near-silent operation was an extra benefit . " the engine is on , and it is totally quiet , " he said , pulling onto the road .
" i start to speed up and again , no sound ! " cheaper and cleaner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 100 drivers will test the new mini-e in berlin like the other test drivers , mueller gives monthly reports on the car 's performance as well as on the operation of the car 's charging station .
the data will be analyzed and used to improve the technology driving the cars .
but mueller said there 's also an environmental advantage to driving an electric car . " sitting in my car , outside feeling the first glimpse of climate change , and not polluting the environment with co2 , that feels really good , " he said .
" i really am proud of driving an electric car and being part of this green revolution . " to fuel the project , swedish energy concern vattenfall has erected two-meter high charging stations throughout the city to dispense electricity generated from renewable sources .
although electric vehicles operate similarly to regular cars , the costs involved are only about 25 percent of their conventional counterparts . bmw has said it takes about 2.4 hours to charge the battery at a vattenfall station or about 10 hours using a regular electricity outlet at home . limited range - for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charge it up and drive up to 250 kilometers a fully tanked battery has a maximum range of 250 kilometers and averages about 170 kilometers under normal driving conditions - both of which are higher than the 95 kilometers required by the average urban driver each day . mueller said he is confident the car 's range will increase as battery technology improves . " there will soon be lithium-ion batteries available that are lighter , smaller and can keep more power , " he said . but vattenfall and bmw are n't the only companies that want to have electric cars zipping around berlin .
energy producer rwe and automaker daimler chose to kick off their nationwide e-mobility road show at potsdamer platz . they came up with a fast , sexy , low-slung , convertible e-car .
but at a conference this month it was only speeding around a virtual road , where the public could test electric racing cars in a simulated driving experience .
unaccustomed to the power , most ended up crashing or running off the road - more than once . ' unbelievable power ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars have more power than many people expect but other visitors opted for the real life experience and took a test drive in an e-vehicle designed for normal use - and to wean the public from its perception of e-cars being puny , anemic vehicles . " there was an almost unbelievable amount of power - you ca n't describe it , " said marek schmidt , who took one of the cars for a spin .
" it 's like a rocket launch .
you just have to try it . " for the project , rwe is building charging stations to supply 100 electric smart cars from daimler . all the companies vying for a part of the e-mobility market in berlin have agreed to standardize their vehicles and charging stations to keep competition open and fair .
dick mckay , who works in the us auto business and attended the daimler-rwe event , said he is sure e-mobility is the future . " there is no way of stopping it , " mckay said .
" this is the way it has to go .
i think this is a good example of cooperation between a major power company and the others - it 's very impressive . " mueller , who is taking part in the vattenfall-bmw test phase , said being an e-guinea pig also entails spreading the message of e-mobility every time you step out of the car . " the moment you stop your car and start to charge , people are almost lining up in front of you and want to know everything , " he said .
" i think there is a high interest there , especially young people are coming up , looking at the car , seeing the cable , and asking really intelligent questions .

more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .

this will hardly be achieved by the increased military forces that currently appease the situation in urumqi .
future integration policies will have to be more inclusive and participatory , integrating the indigenous population more actively in public and governmental institutions . in the long run , political stability for xinjiang can only be envisaged in the context of a changed national political environment based on institutions that guaranty far reaching transparency , extended political rights as well as fair mechanisms of distribution and reconcilement of social interests . authors : julia bader , dr. doris fischer editor : sean sinico julia bader is a political scientist in the " governance , statehood , security " department at the german development institute .

more social justice and cultural integration is necessary , experts at the german development institute say . following the violent unrest in tibet last year , the most violent ethnic motivated upheaval in decades occurred earlier this month in the autonomous region of xinjiang in western china .
the unexpected level of aggression demonstrated during this recent turmoil caused the death of nearly 200 people and left more than 1,600 people injured .
the incident demonstrates the limitations of the concept of social harmony that the chinese government has employed in recent years in order to glaze the social conflicts resulting from rapid .
arguably , the harmonious society envisaged and idealized by the chinese government has never really materialized in the autonomous regions of tibet and xinjiang . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uighurs are not the only ethnic minority in china the roots of the latest unrest go far back into history , as xinjiang for the longest time has been a multi-ethnic region , influenced and ruled by changing forces before it became part of the people 's republic of china .
consequently , a major objective of the chinese government has been to stabilize the region and - especially in the course of the overall reform process - to stimulate economic development .
however , from the perspective of the local " national minorities , " which do not only comprise uighur people but a number of other ethnic groups , the minorities never prospered from the success of china 's rapid economic development in a way the han chinese population did . the chinese government has tried to counter this perception by means of its minority-related policies .
indeed , during the 1990s , the government - among other initiatives - extended the freedom of religion and eased access of the minority people to education and especially to universities .
the " go west " policies of the second half of the 1990s were intended to enhance the development of china 's western areas and to reduce the development gap between the coastal regions and the rest of the country .
compared to other provinces and regions , xinjiang performed better economically and benefited from all kinds of direct and indirect subsidies . nevertheless , minority policies in xinjiang and tibet failed in one crucial aspect : since the early 1990s , as a result of laxer birth controls for minority people , the share of minorities in overall population grew in all autonomous regions or districts of china except for tibet and xinjiang and liaoning , where the minorities declined .
at the same time the population of xinjiang grew from about 15 million people to more than 20 million .
in the urban agglomerations such as urumqi the national minorities that used to dominate the local population literally became minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia bader is a political scientist at the german development institute against this background of huge growth in population , a shift in the relative weight of the minority population as well as a political system which grants rights but does not allow for substantial participation or autonomy , any minor incident could have sparked an outbreak of the simmering conflict .
in this case , the trigger of the unrest has most likely been the economic downturn resulting from the global financial crisis .
this is indicated by the fact that the urumqi unrests followed a conflict among workers of different ethnic groups in a factory located in southern china .
also , han chinese have repeatedly voiced their anger against unfair privileges uighur people presumably enjoy due to their minority status .
such arguments arise in times of crisis when growth is limited and distribution conflicts prevail . due to the specific mixture of historic and short-term factors that have provoked the recent unrest , quick solutions to solve the conflicts clearly are not at hand .
for sure , the chinese government will not endanger national integrity , thereby creating precedence for other provinces or minorities striving for independence .
similarly , the fact that many han chinese families have already lived in xinjiang for generations limits the options for a far-reaching ethnic-based autonomy .
any sustainable political solution for xinjiang would have to respect the needs of uighurs as well as those of the other minorities and the han chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris fischer is an economist at the german development institute to ease the conflict and to establish a literally harmonious society , more social justice and cultural integration among the ethnic groups involved would be needed .

in its annual report on trade , the wto reaffirms that it expects trade to drop 10 percent this year .
and with asia leading the recovery , china looks set to overtake germany as the biggest export nation . last year , germany was still barely holding on to its position as the world 's leading merchandise exporter , with exports of $ 1.47 trillion just edging out china , with some $ 1.43 trillion .
but with asian nations starting to see a rebound in trade and europe still turning in a weak performance , germany 's dominance in exports may be a thing of the past .
discussing the world trade organization 's annual report on world trade , wto chief economist patrick low told reuters news agency that china is expected to overtake germany as the world 's biggest exporter this year .
this would be in keeping with wto director general pascal lamy 's assertion that asian economies " may be leading the new expansion of world trade . "
" no room for complacency " despite that positive news , the report concludes that world trade volumes are still expected to shrink by 10 percent this year , although the contraction appears to be slowing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy " there 's no room for complacency , " lamy told a news conference in singapore , where he was attending a two-day asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- trade meeting .
the annual review for 2009 focused on measures taken by various governments to protect their most important economic sectors .
the wto said it hoped that any protectionist measures implemented as a result of the financial crisis would be reversed as soon as possible .
" protecting trade can be tempting until everybody understands that protectionism does not protect , " lamy said , adding that even emergency contingency measures " need to be used with care . "
lamy also stressed that he would like to see a swift conclusion to the doha round of trade talks , which were launched in doha , qatar , in 2001 .
the talks , which focus on ways to help poorer countries grow their economies , stalled due to the different interests of emerging nations and developed economies. dc / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .

1 . " this is unacceptable , " the unnamed worker said , adding that the pay cut was not being offset by a reduction in working hours or a limited guarantee of ongoing employment - measures daimler offered its internal workforce as compensation for sacrificing pay under a cost-cutting program launched in april daimler confirmed that one-sided pay cuts were being introduced at protics , a data management offshoot that employs some 360 workers in the southern german state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the company said the cuts were , however , only temporary and would be phased out by the end of june 2010 . the stuttgarter zeitung reported that similar one-sided cuts are also planned at daimler tss , a subsidiary that makes software in the southern german city of ulm , but daimler headquarters has declined to comment further on the scope or scale of cuts among its subsidiaries . a company spokeswoman said senior management had made it clear that all parts of the company would have to bear their share of the burden when they first announced their cost-cutting strategy .
she added that it was up to each subsidiary to decide which measures were most appropriate . sje / afp / dpa / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have seen that a number of things have been done , other things need to be done , and so the focus is not on changing the architecture , but on completing the house , " he said .
but getting the house in order is proving tricky .
when the two former communist states joined the european union in 2007 , other member states were particularly concerned about the level of corruption in both countries , and the political power wielded by violent criminal gangs operating in bulgaria .
the eu executive says there are 21 areas in which bulgaria needs to better its performance , and 16 for romania - including the implementation of anti-corruption laws , and boosting the independent power of judges .
decision is a blow to reputation abroad the eu froze millions of euros in funding last year .
since then , the commission says bulgaria has taken steps to clean up its act .
the reports come as a blow to both countries , which are suffering from the public perception they were let in to the eu club too early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many croatians are losing enthusiasm for eu accession that sentiment is felt more acutely in eu candidate countries where accession talks have stalled , like croatia and turkey .
analysts say croatians have been losing enthusiasm for the enlargement process since slovenia started blocking croatia 's membership talks over a territorial dispute in the adriatic .
croatian journalist and political analyst stojan de prato says croatians feel let down .
" we do feel we have been in the enlargement process all too long … . at the moment , it seems we will blocked forever , no-one is doing anything , " he said .
resentment growing there is a growing sense of alienation in other western balkan countries too , that feel either neglected or unfairly treated by the eu .
a recent decision to exclude bosnia from an eu visa liberalization program had some accusing brussels of holding double standards .
and iceland 's decision this month to join the eu led commentators to wonder if it was jumping the queue .

organizers said the two-week event on the banks of lake geneva was " crowned with success , " attracting 10,000 more visitors than last year . in france , summer festivals have flourished over the past two decades , partly the result of a policy drive by the socialist jack lang when he was culture minister in the 1980s .
many events are still thriving despite the recession , and nowhere is this more apparent than in the languedoc-rousillon region . good promotion including the odd online discount ensured that a full house made for a fitting climax to the " jazz a sete " festival .
the organizers have been pleasantly surprised to find that the economic crisis has not deterred music fans . " many people told us that they decided to come because they wanted to have some fun and forget their financial and economic problems , " said danielle dumontel from the tourist office in sete .
" many tourists came at the beginning of july , which is not usual , so it 's a good sign for the summer season . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese singer youssou n 'dour was a draw last year the region sees a wide variety of festivals in the same period - from classical music in montpellier , to a celebration of occitan culture at beziers , to world music at the festival de thau . not enough room for everyone perhaps inevitably there is not enough space for them all .
just down the mediterranean coast from sete , the destination soleil festival at marseillan drew 6,000 people last year to see artists such as youssou n 'dour of senegal . however this year 's event was cancelled . " the number of pre-sales was very weak , to the point where the producer would have gone to the wall , which would have been dramatic for everyone involved , " explained jean-michel le courthezon , responsible for tourism and culture in the resort . he believes fans shunned the festival , not because of the economic crisis , but because organizers were forced to schedule the event earlier than usual , and there was simply too much competition . " in july there are so many other well established festivals in our region , " he said .
" we 're like the little gaulois village in asterix , surrounded by larger communes with big resources . " emmanuel negrier , a specialist in cultural policy at montpellier university , said that in hard economic times a festival 's reputation and relationship with its traditional supporters is crucial . " there are events which have built a relationship with their public , who feel morally obliged to participate to manifest their solidarity , " he said .
" other festivals which did not have this kind of empathy with the public are more in difficulty . " disappointing pre-sales for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salzburg festival opens on july 25 even for well established festivals , success is not guaranteed .
since its birth at the end of the 1980s , the eurockeenes at belfort in eastern france has become one of europe 's best known rock festivals .
this year 's line-up included peter doherty , the prodigy and cypress hill . the event was a success , attracting 95,000 music fans over three days in early july .
but the outcome was uncertain : far fewer tickets were sold before the festival than in previous years , and it seems that many people only decided to go at the last minute . elsewhere in europe , other events are also reporting disappointing advance sales .
the salzburg festival , which starts on july 25 , will feature new productions of works such as handel 's " theodora " and mozart 's " cosi fan tutte . "
but organizers said that advance corporate ticket sales were down 11 percent from last year and overall sales down five percent . in scotland , organizers of the hebridean celtic festival revealed fears for the future of the western isles ' internationally renowned music event , because of a dramatic downturn in local ticket sales .
many visitors come to the outer hebrides expressly for the festival , and the economic impact of its loss would be devastating .
a three-year funding deal has been struck with local business to stave off bankruptcy . cultural events make for good distraction in general , however , the crisis means that sponsors may become reluctant to invest .
according to negrier , events will increasingly need to use social networking tools like facebook to develop ties with the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malian musicians amadou et mariam are performing in sete , france , in august he said festival organizers can be encouraged by the findings of a tourism survey which found that people tend to put money aside for cultural events . " i think that people will spend money less in restaurants , and on programs , and on that special book of the spectacle , " said negrier .
" but i think that culture can be considered as a way to forget the grey aspect of contemporary life . " in sete , festival organizers hope for a sell-out again in august when the malian singing duo amadou and mariam top the bill at fiest 'a sete , a world music festival .
they are boosted by the fact that the recession is prompting many french people to take their holidays at home rather than abroad . the evidence suggests that they are indeed determined to put their everyday worries to one side and make the most of the summer culture on offer . author : alasdair sandford editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hillary clinton on suu kyi : " we have condemned the way that she has been treated " us secretary of state hillary clinton has said washington is " very seriously " concerned about the transfer of nuclear technology from north korea to burma .
arriving in thailand ahead of a forum on regional security , she said the relationship was a threat to stability .
she also condemned burma 's treatment of jailed pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi .
foreign ministers from the asean grouping , as well as eu and us envoys , are meeting on wednesday in thailand .
" we worry about -lrb- the -rrb- transfer of nuclear technology , " mrs clinton said in comments in a television interview in bangkok to be broadcast later .
asked if she meant from north korea to burma , she said : " yes . "
" we know there are also growing concerns about military co-operation between north korea and burma , which we take very seriously , " mrs clinton said on tuesday after meeting prime minister abhisit vejjajiva in the thai capital , bangkok .
" it would be destabilising for the region , it would pose a direct threat to burma 's neighbours , " she said .
' unacceptable treatment ' on her arrival in bangkok , mrs clinton also said : " the united states is back . "
asean leaders have expressed satisfaction that a figure as senior as mrs clinton is attending the regional forum .
during the bush adminsitration more junior us officers were sent , leaving the delegate from china - a growing influence in the region - as the key figure at the talks .
this year 's forum , being held on the resort island of phuket , is expected to focus on north korea and burma .
burma , a member of asean , is likely to face some awkward questions mrs clinton is expected to put pressure on north korea to return to the six-party talks on its nuclear disarmament .
us officials have said she is to meet with her counterparts from the other parties to the six-nation talks : south korea , japan , china and russia .
it is not clear if mrs clinton will meet any north korean delegates .
pyongyang has refused to send its foreign minister to phuket but will send a " roving ambassador " .
speaking on the issue of burma , mrs clinton the us expected " fair treatment " of aung san suu kyi .
" we have condemned the way that she has been treated by the regime in burma , which we consider to be baseless and totally unacceptable . "
ms suu kyi has been jailed or under house arrest for about 14 of the last 20 years .
she is currently in a rangoon prison on trial for allegedly breaking the conditions of her house arrest .
the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- has a policy of non-interference in members ' affairs , but burma has provoked widespread censure .
speaking earlier on tuesday , indonesian foreign minister hasan wirayuda said elections that burma 's military rulers have promised for next year could not be free and fair unless ms suu kyi was freed .
a new human rights body created by asean , lambasted by regional activists as lacking any enforcement power , was almost scuttled over the weekend when an increasingly assertive indonesia sought to strengthen its provisions .

total sales for the month were 6.6 % ahead of the levels registered in june last year .
comparing stores that were open continuously over the 12 months , sales were up 2.2 % .
the figures follow a disappointing showing in may , which the src said were its worst figures for nine years .
non-food sales moved from a particularly sharp year-on-year fall in may to a slight increase in june , while food sales continued to edge up .
the like-for-like scottish retail figures were ahead of the rest of the uk , having dropped below it in april and may for the first time since late 2007 .
the improvement on may 's weak performance is particularly sharp richard dodd src uk sales were 1.4 % above their june 2008 levels .
broken down into sectors , product lines that showed strong june sales included fresh fruit , especially summer berries , along with ice-cream , salads , delicatessen food and barbecue meat .
warm sunny weather also explains a boost to clothing sales that was strongest for t-shirts , shorts , light cardigans , swimwear , sunglasses , sandals and flip-flops .
childrenswear did better than adult fashion .
casual and versatile was preferred to formal wear , with suit sales lagging .
in the health and beauty category , anti-bacterial washes and tissues saw an upturn , which retailers linked to the spread of swine flu .
summer also saw a boost to suncare products and hay fever remedies .
product lines that did badly included discretionary and decorative homewares , and big-ticket household purchases such as furniture .
' still unsure ' richard dodd , spokesman for the scottish retail consortium , described the june figures as " a welcome bit of good news for scottish retailers " .
he said : " the improvement on may 's weak performance is particularly sharp .
" but this is no spending free-for-all .
" fundamentally people are still unsure about jobs and their own personal finances . "
he added : " customers are largely holding back from buying more expensive non-essentials with many retailers selling carpets , furniture and homewares still looking for convincing signs of an upturn . "
earlier this week , a tracker of spending power found that the average scottish family is £ 13 a week better off when compared with june last year .
calculated for the asda supermarket chain , the data reflected the sharp fall in mortgage costs as interests rates plummeted .
it leaves the average scottish family with £ 150 a week of discretionary income , 7.8 % more than june 2008 , when food and fuel prices were rising steeply .
including essential spending , the asda income tracker found average household income rose by £ 8 a week in the year to june 2009 .
