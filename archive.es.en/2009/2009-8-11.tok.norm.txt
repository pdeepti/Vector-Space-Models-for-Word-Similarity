the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only the poll results will tell a candidate from angela merkel 's cdu party has spiced up an otherwise dull campaign with an election poster featuring photos of both her and the chancellor revealing ample cleavage .
the slogan ?
" we have more to offer . " german election campaigns are generally more staid than sexy , but seven weeks until the country heads to the polls , the cdu candidate for the berlin district of kreuzberg has caused an uproar with her new campaign poster .
vera lengsfeld put photos of herself and chancellor merkel sporting very revealing necklines side by side , with the slogan " we have more to offer " splashed across the chancellor 's breasts .
the photo of merkel has previously made the rounds in the german media : it was taken when the chancellor wore an unusually low-cut gown to the 2008 opening of oslo 's opera house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wore her low cut gown to the inauguration of the new opera building in oslo in 2008 lengsfeld , 57 , said she had to resort to desperate measures , as she 's running against incumbent hans-christian stroebele , who has twice won the only directly mandated seat for the greens .
" i needed to come up with something to even be noticed in friedrichshain-kreuzberg , " she said .
clearly , she achieved her goal .
" i had 17,000 clicks in one day on my election blog .
i would not have achieved that with a regular street campaign , " lengsfeld said .
she hung 750 posters in her district , though local media reported that many have already been stolen as souvenirs .
witty or shameful ?
bloggers commenting on the poster were divided .
some described it as " witty , cheeky and fun , " while others dismissed it as " embarrassing and shameful . "
the women 's arm of the cdu reprimanded lengsfeld for resorting to a " sex sells " strategy .
" we do n't need to do things like this anymore , " spokeswoman maria boehmer told a news conference .
lengsfeld said she could n't understand the fuss .
" i find it amazing how little humor some people have shown over this placard , " she said .
" people always complain election posters are boring and then as soon as someone does something different , people get annoyed . "
one person who is likely not amused by lengfeld 's strategy is the chancellor herself .
lengsfeld did not ask for permission to use the famous photo of merkel 's cleavage , and so far , the chancellor 's office has declined to comment. dc / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

only the poll results will tell a candidate from angela merkel 's cdu party has spiced up an otherwise dull campaign with an election poster featuring photos of both her and the chancellor revealing ample cleavage .
the slogan ?
" we have more to offer . " german election campaigns are generally more staid than sexy , but seven weeks until the country heads to the polls , the cdu candidate for the berlin district of kreuzberg has caused an uproar with her new campaign poster .
vera lengsfeld put photos of herself and chancellor merkel sporting very revealing necklines side by side , with the slogan " we have more to offer " splashed across the chancellor 's breasts .
the photo of merkel has previously made the rounds in the german media : it was taken when the chancellor wore an unusually low-cut gown to the 2008 opening of oslo 's opera house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wore her low cut gown to the inauguration of the new opera building in oslo in 2008 lengsfeld , 57 , said she had to resort to desperate measures , as she 's running against incumbent hans-christian stroebele , who has twice won the only directly mandated seat for the greens .
" i needed to come up with something to even be noticed in friedrichshain-kreuzberg , " she said .
clearly , she achieved her goal .
" i had 17,000 clicks in one day on my election blog .
i would not have achieved that with a regular street campaign , " lengsfeld said .
she hung 750 posters in her district , though local media reported that many have already been stolen as souvenirs .
witty or shameful ?
bloggers commenting on the poster were divided .
some described it as " witty , cheeky and fun , " while others dismissed it as " embarrassing and shameful . "
the women 's arm of the cdu reprimanded lengsfeld for resorting to a " sex sells " strategy .
" we do n't need to do things like this anymore , " spokeswoman maria boehmer told a news conference .
lengsfeld said she could n't understand the fuss .
" i find it amazing how little humor some people have shown over this placard , " she said .
" people always complain election posters are boring and then as soon as someone does something different , people get annoyed . "
one person who is likely not amused by lengfeld 's strategy is the chancellor herself .
lengsfeld did not ask for permission to use the famous photo of merkel 's cleavage , and so far , the chancellor 's office has declined to comment. dc / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 11.08.2009 canceled pop fair opens door for cologne festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm was the largest pop music fair in the world since the biggest pop music trade fair in the world was canceled at the last minute this year , the c / o pop festival in cologne has been eyed as a replacement .
it 's not a trade fair - but maybe that does n't matter . the cancellation of popkomm , the international pop music trade fair , in late june cast a shadow on an industry already burdened by the global finance crisis , not to mention the continued effects of the digitalization age . dieter gorny , who founded popkomm in cologne in 1990 , had blamed the cancelation on illegal music downloads , saying that the " digital crisis had hit the music industry head on " and " many companies could no longer afford to participate at popkomm . " the fair was cancelled just six weeks ago and it already has stiff competition , said journalist , producer and pop expert ralf niemczyk .
" it will be difficult for the association of the german music industry to work against that . " for niemczyk , the end of the berlin popkomm was an inevitability , despite speculations over the past few weeks that it might return to the rhineland in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 music groups are set to perform at c / o pop it had been at home there , in cologne , from 1990 to 2003 .
when it left , a music festival - c / o pop , short for cologne on pop - sprung up in its place . festival wo n't become trade fair the event , which has been growing consistently since its start in 2004 , is a cross between a music festival and an academic conference .
but since popkomm 's cancelation , rumors have abounded that c / o pop may become more than just its successor on the rhine river - that it could morph into a trade fair itself and replace the berlin event , nixing a possible 2010 comeback . c / o pop confirmed media reports in a press statement on july 9 that its management had been in talks with koelnmesse , the city 's trade fair organizer , regarding a possible partnership . however , c / o pop 's head of strategy , ralph christoph , said the aim was n't to build up a new trade fair , but to " make the most of synergies that can bring about a trade fair . " one of those synergies is valuable contacts to other branches , something christoph said is currently in discussion .
" but it would be totally misleading to thing that c / o pop is going to become a trade fair like popkomm used to be , " he added .
" that 's definitely been shelved and is n't what koelnmesse is after . " synergy not always possible away from the stages , the conference side of c / o pop , which runs from august 12-16 , focuses on the dangers and possibilities that come with digitalization .
the aim is to establish new forms of musicology that correspond to the changing market in the digital age . that 's where networking with other branches or other media comes into play .
one natural connection is to the computer game industry - which , coincidentally , is hosting its own gamescom trade fair this month in cologne . niemczyk , however , said that media-based industries like computer games , film , music or design are very close and often people are involved in all of them - like the " dj who is a designer and develops computer games , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c / o pop focuses on making music and talking about it " but i 've noticed that the individual fields are still really separate , because it 's the distribution routes that are important and these are still really different , " he added .
" that means that discourse with the upcoming gamescom in cologne is totally absent , because they 're just interested in selling .
it 's a so-called ' top down event ' : big companies sell their games to dumb kids . " making a name for cologne effective and diverse synergies in the pop culture industries may still be a distant dream , but c / o pop appears to be in a good position for that future .
it 's been in the black since 2008 , and , despite the financial crisis , it still gets financial backing from the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the european union and corporate partners . " it should be a sign to all the participants - to the city and the state - to keep investing in things like c / o pop , because it secures jobs and even creates them , " said christoph . " we know very well that culture can be a very important location factor when it comes to getting people into the city and not letting cologne be completely left in the dust in the national , and even international , context , " he added . author : olaf karnik / kate bowen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister for agriculture , food , and consumer protection , ilse aigner of the christian social union , presented the new logo , saying that any food or drinks without a trace of genetically modified ingredients would be allowed to carry it .
the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .
however , before the new symbol can be used , an organization needs to be formed within the industry that ascertains which products qualify to carry the logo .
aigner also said that any company that used the logo without permission or in a misleading way would face fines and possibly product withdrawals from supermarkets until the packaging was corrected .
carrying the logo would not mean that the foodstuffs were free of pesticides or other chemicals .
german producers have been allowed to label their food as free of genetically modified ingredients for some time , however , there was no standardized logo .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .

schumacher says neck injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident earlier this year are to blame . on his web site , michael schumacher wrote that he had informed ferrari president luca di montezemolo that he was unable to step in for injured driver felipe massa .
the former champion said the fractures he sustained in a motorcycle accident in spain in february meant that his neck would not be able to withstand the stresses caused by competing in a formula one race .
" unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private f1-day in mugello , even if medically or therapeutically we tried everything possible , " he said .
" i really tried everything to make that temporary comeback possible , however , much to my regret it did n't work out , " schumacher said .
the worst crash of his career the seven-time drivers ' champion electrified the racing community last month , when he agreed to race temporarily for ferrari in place of brazilian driver felipe massa , who sustained severe head injuries in a horrific crash last month during qualifying at the hungarian grand prix in budapest .
massa is currently recovering in brazil .
schumacher had been expected to drive for ferrari at the european grand prix at valencia on august 23 .
michael schumacher 's manager , willi weber , told german news agency dpa on tuesday that the motorcycle crash last february was the most serious of schumacher 's career .
" it 's a real pity , " weber said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .

too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

germany 's minister for agriculture , food , and consumer protection , ilse aigner of the christian social union , presented the new logo , saying that any food or drinks without a trace of genetically modified ingredients would be allowed to carry it .
the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .
however , before the new symbol can be used , an organization needs to be formed within the industry that ascertains which products qualify to carry the logo .
aigner also said that any company that used the logo without permission or in a misleading way would face fines and possibly product withdrawals from supermarkets until the packaging was corrected .
carrying the logo would not mean that the foodstuffs were free of pesticides or other chemicals .
german producers have been allowed to label their food as free of genetically modified ingredients for some time , however , there was no standardized logo .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .

under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schumacher says neck injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident earlier this year are to blame . on his web site , michael schumacher wrote that he had informed ferrari president luca di montezemolo that he was unable to step in for injured driver felipe massa .
the former champion said the fractures he sustained in a motorcycle accident in spain in february meant that his neck would not be able to withstand the stresses caused by competing in a formula one race .
" unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private f1-day in mugello , even if medically or therapeutically we tried everything possible , " he said .
" i really tried everything to make that temporary comeback possible , however , much to my regret it did n't work out , " schumacher said .

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.08.2009 sentence for burma 's aung san suu kyi sparks outrage and cautious hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burmese opposition supporters have been demanding suu kyi 's release for years european leaders have condemned a burmese court 's decision to extend the house arrest of pro-democracy activist aung san suu kyi .
but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .

lorch said .

the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .

" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .

but in germany consumers are buying ever more fair trade products . last year , german consumers spent 266 million euros -lrb- $ 376 million -rrb- on products carrying the international initiative 's green and blue logo , which exists in the same form throughout europe .
this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in developing countries rely on fair prices to sustain even a basic existence the fair trade initiative started in germany in 1992 .
despite the success of certain brands , germany still lags behind other european countries in its embrace of fair trade - an idea of social trade whereby the profits are divided fairly between producers , go-betweens and sellers .
bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

but in germany consumers are buying ever more fair trade products . last year , german consumers spent 266 million euros -lrb- $ 376 million -rrb- on products carrying the international initiative 's green and blue logo , which exists in the same form throughout europe .
this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .

despite the success of certain brands , germany still lags behind other european countries in its embrace of fair trade - an idea of social trade whereby the profits are divided fairly between producers , go-betweens and sellers .
bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .

germany 's minister for agriculture , food , and consumer protection , ilse aigner of the christian social union , presented the new logo , saying that any food or drinks without a trace of genetically modified ingredients would be allowed to carry it .
the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .
however , before the new symbol can be used , an organization needs to be formed within the industry that ascertains which products qualify to carry the logo .
aigner also said that any company that used the logo without permission or in a misleading way would face fines and possibly product withdrawals from supermarkets until the packaging was corrected .
carrying the logo would not mean that the foodstuffs were free of pesticides or other chemicals .
german producers have been allowed to label their food as free of genetically modified ingredients for some time , however , there was no standardized logo .

germany 's minister for agriculture , food , and consumer protection , ilse aigner of the christian social union , presented the new logo , saying that any food or drinks without a trace of genetically modified ingredients would be allowed to carry it .
the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .
however , before the new symbol can be used , an organization needs to be formed within the industry that ascertains which products qualify to carry the logo .
aigner also said that any company that used the logo without permission or in a misleading way would face fines and possibly product withdrawals from supermarkets until the packaging was corrected .
carrying the logo would not mean that the foodstuffs were free of pesticides or other chemicals .
german producers have been allowed to label their food as free of genetically modified ingredients for some time , however , there was no standardized logo .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schumacher says neck injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident earlier this year are to blame . on his web site , michael schumacher wrote that he had informed ferrari president luca di montezemolo that he was unable to step in for injured driver felipe massa .
the former champion said the fractures he sustained in a motorcycle accident in spain in february meant that his neck would not be able to withstand the stresses caused by competing in a formula one race .
" unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private f1-day in mugello , even if medically or therapeutically we tried everything possible , " he said .
" i really tried everything to make that temporary comeback possible , however , much to my regret it did n't work out , " schumacher said .
the worst crash of his career the seven-time drivers ' champion electrified the racing community last month , when he agreed to race temporarily for ferrari in place of brazilian driver felipe massa , who sustained severe head injuries in a horrific crash last month during qualifying at the hungarian grand prix in budapest .
massa is currently recovering in brazil .
schumacher had been expected to drive for ferrari at the european grand prix at valencia on august 23 .
michael schumacher 's manager , willi weber , told german news agency dpa on tuesday that the motorcycle crash last february was the most serious of schumacher 's career .
" it 's a real pity , " weber said .
" like everyone else , i was really looking forward to the comeback . " ca / afp / ap / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "

germany 's minister for agriculture , food , and consumer protection , ilse aigner of the christian social union , presented the new logo , saying that any food or drinks without a trace of genetically modified ingredients would be allowed to carry it .
the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .
however , before the new symbol can be used , an organization needs to be formed within the industry that ascertains which products qualify to carry the logo .
aigner also said that any company that used the logo without permission or in a misleading way would face fines and possibly product withdrawals from supermarkets until the packaging was corrected .
carrying the logo would not mean that the foodstuffs were free of pesticides or other chemicals .
german producers have been allowed to label their food as free of genetically modified ingredients for some time , however , there was no standardized logo .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .

a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .

but in germany consumers are buying ever more fair trade products . last year , german consumers spent 266 million euros -lrb- $ 376 million -rrb- on products carrying the international initiative 's green and blue logo , which exists in the same form throughout europe .
this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in developing countries rely on fair prices to sustain even a basic existence the fair trade initiative started in germany in 1992 .
despite the success of certain brands , germany still lags behind other european countries in its embrace of fair trade - an idea of social trade whereby the profits are divided fairly between producers , go-betweens and sellers .
bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

" this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .

under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

accusation vs. denial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activist natalya estemirova was found dead in grozny in july less than a month ago a human rights activist for the group memorial , natalya estemirova , was found dead on a roadside hours after her abduction in grozny .
following her murder , memorial accused chechnya 's pro-kremlin leader ramzan kadyrov of being behind the crime , an allegation that kadyrov flatly denied .
speaking to the russian service of radio free europe on monday , he asked why he should kill a woman who was of no use to anyone .
" she was without honor , merit or conscience , " he said .
kadyrov has been credited with restoring some stability to the region , which has seen two wars between russia 's central government and chechen separatist forces , but he is far from popular with human rights activists who say he lets his personal militia kidnap and torture at will. tkw / reuters / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

germany 's minister for agriculture , food , and consumer protection , ilse aigner of the christian social union , presented the new logo , saying that any food or drinks without a trace of genetically modified ingredients would be allowed to carry it .
the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .
however , before the new symbol can be used , an organization needs to be formed within the industry that ascertains which products qualify to carry the logo .
aigner also said that any company that used the logo without permission or in a misleading way would face fines and possibly product withdrawals from supermarkets until the packaging was corrected .
carrying the logo would not mean that the foodstuffs were free of pesticides or other chemicals .
german producers have been allowed to label their food as free of genetically modified ingredients for some time , however , there was no standardized logo .

schumacher says neck injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident earlier this year are to blame . on his web site , michael schumacher wrote that he had informed ferrari president luca di montezemolo that he was unable to step in for injured driver felipe massa .
the former champion said the fractures he sustained in a motorcycle accident in spain in february meant that his neck would not be able to withstand the stresses caused by competing in a formula one race .
" unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private f1-day in mugello , even if medically or therapeutically we tried everything possible , " he said .
" i really tried everything to make that temporary comeback possible , however , much to my regret it did n't work out , " schumacher said .
the worst crash of his career the seven-time drivers ' champion electrified the racing community last month , when he agreed to race temporarily for ferrari in place of brazilian driver felipe massa , who sustained severe head injuries in a horrific crash last month during qualifying at the hungarian grand prix in budapest .
massa is currently recovering in brazil .
schumacher had been expected to drive for ferrari at the european grand prix at valencia on august 23 .
michael schumacher 's manager , willi weber , told german news agency dpa on tuesday that the motorcycle crash last february was the most serious of schumacher 's career .
" it 's a real pity , " weber said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2009 greenpeace drops ' granite shield ' off sweden 's coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fish stocks in the baltic sea have plummeted since 1995 , greenpeace says environmentalists are dropping boulders off the coast of sweden in an attempt to stop environmentally damaging fishing practices and to put pressure on sweden 's eu presidency . the environmental activist group greenpeace dropped dozens of boulders into the kattegatt , the strait between sweden and denmark , on monday . the boulders , greenpeace hopes , will protect the area from the effects of " bottom trawling , " a method of fishing that rakes the seabed with nets .
greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .

despite the success of certain brands , germany still lags behind other european countries in its embrace of fair trade - an idea of social trade whereby the profits are divided fairly between producers , go-betweens and sellers .
bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .

a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .

" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .

lorch said .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .
natura 2000 is a network of nature areas around europe that are protected by european union legislation .
putting pressure on the presidency sweden , which now holds the six-month eu presidency , said that while it wanted to protect marine life , the waters were not a spawning area for popular species like cod .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace sank boulders off germany last year " the swedish government needs to fulfill its commitment to protect the area and put a permanent ban on fishing in fladen and lilla middelgrund , " greenpeace ocean campaigner isadora wronski said in a statement issued by the activist .
under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .

greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .

the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .

massa is currently recovering in brazil .
schumacher had been expected to drive for ferrari at the european grand prix at valencia on august 23 .
michael schumacher 's manager , willi weber , told german news agency dpa on tuesday that the motorcycle crash last february was the most serious of schumacher 's career .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .

bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

germany 's minister for agriculture , food , and consumer protection , ilse aigner of the christian social union , presented the new logo , saying that any food or drinks without a trace of genetically modified ingredients would be allowed to carry it .
the agriculture ministry says the logo is likely to come into use later this year .
however , before the new symbol can be used , an organization needs to be formed within the industry that ascertains which products qualify to carry the logo .
aigner also said that any company that used the logo without permission or in a misleading way would face fines and possibly product withdrawals from supermarkets until the packaging was corrected .
carrying the logo would not mean that the foodstuffs were free of pesticides or other chemicals .
german producers have been allowed to label their food as free of genetically modified ingredients for some time , however , there was no standardized logo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

the former champion said the fractures he sustained in a motorcycle accident in spain in february meant that his neck would not be able to withstand the stresses caused by competing in a formula one race .
" unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private f1-day in mugello , even if medically or therapeutically we tried everything possible , " he said .
" i really tried everything to make that temporary comeback possible , however , much to my regret it did n't work out , " schumacher said .
the worst crash of his career the seven-time drivers ' champion electrified the racing community last month , when he agreed to race temporarily for ferrari in place of brazilian driver felipe massa , who sustained severe head injuries in a horrific crash last month during qualifying at the hungarian grand prix in budapest .
massa is currently recovering in brazil .
schumacher had been expected to drive for ferrari at the european grand prix at valencia on august 23 .
michael schumacher 's manager , willi weber , told german news agency dpa on tuesday that the motorcycle crash last february was the most serious of schumacher 's career .
" it 's a real pity , " weber said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary . " the only way to address the situation fully is to put strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions and find ways to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , " siddall said .

but others say it signals that the military regime is somewhat susceptible to pressure . the verdict came after a court in rangoon , burma 's largest city , found that suu kyi had violated the terms of her current house arrest by allowing an american national to stay at her home .
the court sentenced her to three years imprisonment , but burmese junta leader senior general than shwe immediately commuted the sentence to 18 months house arrest .
the case of nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has attracted broad international attention , and european leaders were quick to criticize the verdict .
" i am both saddened and angry at the verdict today , august 11 , following the sham trial of aung san suu kyi , " british prime minister gordon brown said in an official statement .
" this is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime 's planned elections next year . "
a spokesperson for the eu rotating presidency , currently held by sweden , also rejected the verdict and called upon the burmese government to free the pro-democracy leader immediately .
human rights groups have universally deplored the verdict .
burma has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962 .
the currently leadership has scheduled a national election for december of next year in a bid to bolster its own legitimacy both within burma and in the eyes of the international community .
suu kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years -allegedly for presenting a threat to national security .
sensitive to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial was held in a special courtroom in rangoon 's insein prison the eighteen-month extension of suu kyi 's house arrest means that burma 's most potent symbol of democracy wo n't be able to play an active role in next year 's vote .
but the opposition leader could have been sent to jail , and experts say the fact the ruling junta did not exercise that option is a sign that burma 's leaders are at least concerned with maintaining appearances .
" i see it somewhat positively , " axel bruns - a german burma expert who has lived in the country for many years - told deutsche welle .
" no one was expecting an acquittal , and there was the prospect of a five-year prison term , so this is perhaps a sign of moderation . "
jasmin lorch , a visiting fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , has a different take on the verdict .
" of course , this was a show trial , " lorch said .
" she was never proven to have committed any crimes and her party is in fact legal even under highly repressive burmese martial law . "
" but the verdict , " lorch added , " shows the burmese government is - to a limited extent - susceptible to international pressure and pressure from people inside burma who support the democratic opposition . "
the burmese government 's decision to extend suu kyi 's arrest may be a sign that the military junta realizes there are limits on its power .
but it also puts her opposition national league for democracy party -lrb- nld -rrb- in a bind concerning the planned 2010 elections .
rock and a hard place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi won the nobel peace prize in 1991 the nld won a convincing majority in elections in 1990 , the last remotely fair vote in burma .
that would have made suu kyi the prime minister , but the military leadership immediately nullified the result .
now her party must decide whether to take part in a poll that shows little prospect of being just .
the nld has said it plans to boycott the election , but it 's difficult to tell whether that 's the right strategy .
" the opposition probably wo n't take part in the vote , which i think is a shame personally because they should try to put up stumbling blocks for the government , " bruns said .
" the dilemma for the opposition is : do they participate in the election without their leading symbolic figure and legitimate the process , or do they risk being banned outright for not taking part ? "
lorch said .
and although international pressure may have helped convince the burmese leadership not to incarcerate suu kyi , there 's little the world can do to prevent the government from manipulating the 2010 poll .
" the international community has few opportunities to exercise any real influence , " lorch told deutsche welle .
" the burmese government is perhaps somewhat more sensible to what their neighbors in asia think , but even there , the possibilities are limited . "
if so , that leaves the burmese pro-democracy movement and its leader aung san suu kyi essentially on their own and still in a relatively precarious position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 11.08.2009 canceled pop fair opens door for cologne festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm was the largest pop music fair in the world since the biggest pop music trade fair in the world was canceled at the last minute this year , the c / o pop festival in cologne has been eyed as a replacement .
it 's not a trade fair - but maybe that does n't matter . the cancellation of popkomm , the international pop music trade fair , in late june cast a shadow on an industry already burdened by the global finance crisis , not to mention the continued effects of the digitalization age . dieter gorny , who founded popkomm in cologne in 1990 , had blamed the cancelation on illegal music downloads , saying that the " digital crisis had hit the music industry head on " and " many companies could no longer afford to participate at popkomm . " the fair was cancelled just six weeks ago and it already has stiff competition , said journalist , producer and pop expert ralf niemczyk .
" it will be difficult for the association of the german music industry to work against that . " for niemczyk , the end of the berlin popkomm was an inevitability , despite speculations over the past few weeks that it might return to the rhineland in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 music groups are set to perform at c / o pop it had been at home there , in cologne , from 1990 to 2003 .
when it left , a music festival - c / o pop , short for cologne on pop - sprung up in its place . festival wo n't become trade fair the event , which has been growing consistently since its start in 2004 , is a cross between a music festival and an academic conference .
but since popkomm 's cancelation , rumors have abounded that c / o pop may become more than just its successor on the rhine river - that it could morph into a trade fair itself and replace the berlin event , nixing a possible 2010 comeback . c / o pop confirmed media reports in a press statement on july 9 that its management had been in talks with koelnmesse , the city 's trade fair organizer , regarding a possible partnership . however , c / o pop 's head of strategy , ralph christoph , said the aim was n't to build up a new trade fair , but to " make the most of synergies that can bring about a trade fair . " one of those synergies is valuable contacts to other branches , something christoph said is currently in discussion .
" but it would be totally misleading to thing that c / o pop is going to become a trade fair like popkomm used to be , " he added .
" that 's definitely been shelved and is n't what koelnmesse is after . " synergy not always possible away from the stages , the conference side of c / o pop , which runs from august 12-16 , focuses on the dangers and possibilities that come with digitalization .
the aim is to establish new forms of musicology that correspond to the changing market in the digital age . that 's where networking with other branches or other media comes into play .
one natural connection is to the computer game industry - which , coincidentally , is hosting its own gamescom trade fair this month in cologne . niemczyk , however , said that media-based industries like computer games , film , music or design are very close and often people are involved in all of them - like the " dj who is a designer and develops computer games , too . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c / o pop focuses on making music and talking about it " but i 've noticed that the individual fields are still really separate , because it 's the distribution routes that are important and these are still really different , " he added .
" that means that discourse with the upcoming gamescom in cologne is totally absent , because they 're just interested in selling .
it 's a so-called ' top down event ' : big companies sell their games to dumb kids . " making a name for cologne effective and diverse synergies in the pop culture industries may still be a distant dream , but c / o pop appears to be in a good position for that future .
it 's been in the black since 2008 , and , despite the financial crisis , it still gets financial backing from the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the european union and corporate partners . " it should be a sign to all the participants - to the city and the state - to keep investing in things like c / o pop , because it secures jobs and even creates them , " said christoph . " we know very well that culture can be a very important location factor when it comes to getting people into the city and not letting cologne be completely left in the dust in the national , and even international , context , " he added . author : olaf karnik / kate bowen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in germany consumers are buying ever more fair trade products . last year , german consumers spent 266 million euros -lrb- $ 376 million -rrb- on products carrying the international initiative 's green and blue logo , which exists in the same form throughout europe .
this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .

bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .
greenpeace sank the boulders , weighing between half a ton and three tons -lrb- 1,100 lbs to 6,600 lbs -rrb- , in " natura 2000 " zones in the fladen and lilla middelgrund areas , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- off sweden 's southwest coast .

under the eu common fisheries policy -lrb- cfp -rrb- members can ban their own vessels from an area as well as those of another nation , by bilateral agreement , but they can not issue a general fishing ban on a site .
greenpeace urged the swedish eu presidency to reform the cfp to enable member states to impose tougher conservation measures on protected marine areas .
magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .

magnus kindbom , a political adviser at sweden 's fisheries ministry , told news agency afp that the action threatened agreements with neighboring denmark on fishing bans in larger , more sensitive fishing areas between their coasts .
battling trawlers greenpeace say the area in question is the only one off sweden known to hold maerl beds , formed from slow-growing algae , and bubble reefs made of lime deposit , and is vulnerable to bottom trawling .
the environmentalists say that before the kattegat 's fish stocks collapsed , it held important feeding grounds for fish and a spawning ground for herring .
it is an important winter feeding ground for many seabirds and is covered with kelp forests teeming with marine life .
last year , greenpeace sunk 320 boulders in the sylt outer reef off the northern coast of germany , another natura 2000 site , which was being damaged by bottom trawling .
the boulders have since prevented trawlers from fishing the reef .
greenpeace says the boulders have already been colonized by a wealth of marine life. sjt / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greenpeace was " threatening necessary cooperation , " sweden 's agriculture and fisheries minister , eskil erlandsson , wrote in an editorial in swedish daily dagens nyheter over the weekend .
he called the actions confrontational and unilateral and said the organization 's undertaking was unnecessary seeing as marine protection is already on the eu 's agenda .

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de brands -pipe- 11.08.2009 fair trade booming despite german belt-tightening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee has been one of fair trade 's biggest marketing successes in times of economic crisis , more expensive or niche goods might be expected to be the first victims of tighter budgets .
but in germany consumers are buying ever more fair trade products . last year , german consumers spent 266 million euros -lrb- $ 376 million -rrb- on products carrying the international initiative 's green and blue logo , which exists in the same form throughout europe .
this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in developing countries rely on fair prices to sustain even a basic existence the fair trade initiative started in germany in 1992 .
despite the success of certain brands , germany still lags behind other european countries in its embrace of fair trade - an idea of social trade whereby the profits are divided fairly between producers , go-betweens and sellers .
bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .

though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 11.08.2009 german consumer prices fall for the first time in 22 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling energy costs have led to a drop in average consumer prices in germany government data shows that consumer prices in germany dropped year-on-year by 0.5 percent in july , slightly less than the 0.6 percent decrease officials had predicted .
the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 11.08.2009 german consumer prices fall for the first time in 22 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling energy costs have led to a drop in average consumer prices in germany government data shows that consumer prices in germany dropped year-on-year by 0.5 percent in july , slightly less than the 0.6 percent decrease officials had predicted .
the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de brands -pipe- 11.08.2009 fair trade booming despite german belt-tightening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee has been one of fair trade 's biggest marketing successes in times of economic crisis , more expensive or niche goods might be expected to be the first victims of tighter budgets .
but in germany consumers are buying ever more fair trade products . last year , german consumers spent 266 million euros -lrb- $ 376 million -rrb- on products carrying the international initiative 's green and blue logo , which exists in the same form throughout europe .
this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in developing countries rely on fair prices to sustain even a basic existence the fair trade initiative started in germany in 1992 .
despite the success of certain brands , germany still lags behind other european countries in its embrace of fair trade - an idea of social trade whereby the profits are divided fairly between producers , go-betweens and sellers .
bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "
though there is a demand in industrialized countries for ethical products , fair trade advocates say more could be done .
governments and companies could also make fair-trade purchases , fairtrade forum 's bill said , adding that the supply is great enough to meet an increase in demand .

but in germany consumers are buying ever more fair trade products . last year , german consumers spent 266 million euros -lrb- $ 376 million -rrb- on products carrying the international initiative 's green and blue logo , which exists in the same form throughout europe .
this amounts to nearly three times the fair trade sales of just five years ago .
" the financial crisis has not affected fairtrade sales at all , " said hans-christoph bill , the managing director of germany 's fair trade forum , the network of fair trade organizations in the country .
the organization registered a sales increase of 38 percent in 2008 , in spite of the financial crisis .
it 's expecting double-digit growth for 2009 .
the biggest increase has been in the sale fruit juices - up by 80 percent - while coffee , tea and honey continue to do well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in developing countries rely on fair prices to sustain even a basic existence the fair trade initiative started in germany in 1992 .
despite the success of certain brands , germany still lags behind other european countries in its embrace of fair trade - an idea of social trade whereby the profits are divided fairly between producers , go-betweens and sellers .
bill cited the uk as an example of productive government involvement , with london quadrupling subsidies for ethical products in recent years .
too much competition another reason for germany 's comparatively lackluster performance was the high extent of competition within the country 's food industry .
germany 's wide range of supermarket and discount outlets made it difficult for the branding to spread throughout the market , bill said .
with the economic crisis pushing up basic costs in developing countries , suppliers now rely even more on a fair price for their products and on consumers continuing to buy them .
" it 's a different story for the producers , " said bill .
" even before the crisis every second starving person in the world was a small-holder from a developing country .
our trading partners are suffering very greatly from the crisis , because the prices for basic goods , for fuel , for fertilizer have gone up .
it 's getting harder for farmers to get loans to prepare for the harvest and subsidies for poorer countries have been decreasing in recent years . "

the decline is the first since march 1987 . authorities say the fall has been triggered by sharp drops in the cost of energy and fuel . crude-oil prices have plummeted by more than half after peaking in july 2008 , putting additional downward pressure on inflation as the global recession cut into german exports and forced many companies to put workers on reduced hours .
germany is facing its worst economic downturn since world war ii , with government forecasts suggesting that europe 's largest economy will contract 6 percent this year .
although the recent fall in price levels has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence in germany , analysts warn that a sustained period of deflation could stifle the nation 's economic recovery and trigger a massive rise in unemployment . economists are already warning that the euro zone should brace itself for a wave of lay-offs by the end of the year as the knock-on effects of the global recession impact the labor market .
while the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- says the euro-area economy wo n't return to quarterly growth until next year , it has downplayed the threat of deflation in the region .
the ecb aims to keep inflation in the 16-nation euro region just below 2 percent .
last week ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's inflation expectations " are in line with avoiding those risks and we will continue to be very alert in this respect . "
earlier this month the ecb announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and lend banks as much cash as the want in an effort to promote credit flows. sje / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.08.2009 sea level does not rise uniformly across the globe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the thinning of ice shelves in the antarctic is one factor contributing to sea level rise the rise in sea levels is one of the topics delegates from 180 nations will discuss at climate talks this week in bonn .
experts say even a minor increase in water levels will have a major effect on low-lying nations . sea levels could rise by up to 59 centimeters -lrb- 23 inches -rrb- by the year 2100 , according to a 2007 study by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
but over the past two years many scientists have said the report underestimated the threat posed by rising water levels . mark siddall from britain 's university of bristol along with other colleagues from switzerland and the united states last week released a study showing that sea levels could go up between seven and 82 centimeters by the end of the century . threat to low-lying areas the team simulated sea-level fluctuations in response to climate change over various interglacial periods spanning 22,000 years .
while the study 's estimates are less that the two-meter increase other researches have predicted , siddall said even a slight increase in levels could seriously affect low-lying areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods and cyclones such as the ' aila ' in bangladesh may become more frequent " even a 10 centimeter rise in an area such as bangladesh could be catastrophic , " he said .
" and we 're looking at many 10s of centimeters of change .
this means that floods which might have only affected areas once every 10 years or so might affect them much more regularly . " a number of factors will go into determining how high sea levels rise and what parts of the world are most affected , siddall added .
increased greenhouse gas emissions are making ocean water warmer , causing them to expand in volume as they trap heat .
the ocean 's complex dynamics mean changes in sea level patterns will not the same across the globe . sea level rise not globally uniform " in the southern ocean there tends to be a zone that cuts through the southern part of australia to just south of south africa , and into the atlantic .
this is a key area , where sea levels are rising faster relative to other areas , " said nathan bindoff , a professor at the university of tasmania , australia , and the lead coordinating author for oceans in the 2007 ipcc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are five major ocean-wide gyres in the sub-tropical bands another important factor in explaining the uneven rise of sea levels is the so-called coriolis force exerted by the spinning of the earth .
the planet 's rotation affects ocean currents and atmospheric winds , causing water to pool along subtropical bands , causing what are known as gyres . the heat-induced expansion of water can cause the subtropical gyres to rise , increasing ocean circulation around them .
the areas around the major gyres are likely to see higher sea level rises than other parts of the oceans . melting of ice sheets warmer ocean temperatures also cause the melting of continental ice sheets like in the antarctic .
the free-floating shelves of ice hanging over the edge of the ice sheets are becoming thinner as they come into contact with warmer water at the base of the shelves , bindoff said . " the ice shelves play an important role against the flow of the grounded ice behind , which we call the ice sheet itself , " he said .
" that ice sheet 's flow accelerates when you thin the ice shelves . " this ground , or glacial , ice that comes forward then further melts , contributing to sea level rise , bindoff added . while there is still speculation about how much the sea levels will rise in different parts of the world , siddall and bindoff agree a reduction in carbon emissions is necessary .

only the poll results will tell a candidate from angela merkel 's cdu party has spiced up an otherwise dull campaign with an election poster featuring photos of both her and the chancellor revealing ample cleavage .
the slogan ?
" we have more to offer . " german election campaigns are generally more staid than sexy , but seven weeks until the country heads to the polls , the cdu candidate for the berlin district of kreuzberg has caused an uproar with her new campaign poster .
vera lengsfeld put photos of herself and chancellor merkel sporting very revealing necklines side by side , with the slogan " we have more to offer " splashed across the chancellor 's breasts .
the photo of merkel has previously made the rounds in the german media : it was taken when the chancellor wore an unusually low-cut gown to the 2008 opening of oslo 's opera house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wore her low cut gown to the inauguration of the new opera building in oslo in 2008 lengsfeld , 57 , said she had to resort to desperate measures , as she 's running against incumbent hans-christian stroebele , who has twice won the only directly mandated seat for the greens .
" i needed to come up with something to even be noticed in friedrichshain-kreuzberg , " she said .
clearly , she achieved her goal .
" i had 17,000 clicks in one day on my election blog .
i would not have achieved that with a regular street campaign , " lengsfeld said .
she hung 750 posters in her district , though local media reported that many have already been stolen as souvenirs .
witty or shameful ?
bloggers commenting on the poster were divided .
some described it as " witty , cheeky and fun , " while others dismissed it as " embarrassing and shameful . "
the women 's arm of the cdu reprimanded lengsfeld for resorting to a " sex sells " strategy .
" we do n't need to do things like this anymore , " spokeswoman maria boehmer told a news conference .
lengsfeld said she could n't understand the fuss .
" i find it amazing how little humor some people have shown over this placard , " she said .
" people always complain election posters are boring and then as soon as someone does something different , people get annoyed . "
one person who is likely not amused by lengfeld 's strategy is the chancellor herself .
lengsfeld did not ask for permission to use the famous photo of merkel 's cleavage , and so far , the chancellor 's office has declined to comment. dc / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a harvard trained lawyer with a ph.d. in political economy , she has travelled throughout europe and africa covering political , economic and cultural affairs .
she has lived in germany for nearly twenty years . until joining the “ journal “ several years ago , melinda crane worked mostly on the other side of the camera .
as a producer and writer of documentary films and magazine reports , she covered many of the major changes that have transformed europe over the past decades .
for us and german news organisations including christian science monitor , pbs , and several ard affiliates , she has travelled from spain to turkey , from sweden to ethiopia .
she reported extensively from eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall , covered spanish accession to the eu , french attitudes towards maastricht , and was in the balkans when war erupted between serbia and croatia .
that experience led to more than two years of work on the subject of war crimes , including articles for the new york times magazine and two documentaries for german television . melinda is attracted to journalism in part because it is a generalists ‘ profession which allows her to draw on work in other fields .
after studying history at brown university , she graduated from harvard law school and worked briefly for law firms in new york and washington before obtaining an additional degree at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy .
fieldwork for a dissertation on the political economy of development assistance took her throughout africa and proved invaluable when she returned later , as a journalist . it is nearly 20 years since melinda arrived in germany for what was supposed to be a three month stay on a daad “ kurzstipendium “ or “ short stipend “ !
as a student of history and politics , she found one aspect of the country ‘ s culture particularly fascinating : the high degree of introspection , of often painful sensitivity to questions of history and identity .
being part of that process is one of the attractions of her current work dw-tv , helping to shape germans ‘ view of the world , and the world ’ s view of germany . < back send us an e-mail email : mail to melinda crane www-links externer link : www.amazon.com my favourite websites !

because i holiday in my caravan in west wales , i do n't delegate authority to anyone else as i 'm available to make any emergency decision as and when required " first minister rhodri morgan " because i holiday in my caravan in west wales , i do n't delegate authority to anyone else as i 'm available to make any emergency decision as and when required , " said mr morgan , who has gone on holiday to the beach with his family for some 40 years .
mr morgan 's spokeswoman said he had his mobile phone with him and was always contactable .
he spoke amid continued media speculation about who is in charge of uk while gordon brown is on holiday in scotland and the lake district .
downing street was forced to deny that lord mandelson was running the country via his blackberry after he was pictured on holiday in corfu , even though labour deputy leader harriet harman had handed over duty for filling in for mr brown before she too left on her holidays .
' merry-go-round ' lord mandelson , who has since returned to britain , will then hand over the role to the chancellor alistair darling , who begins a stint on sunday .
however , the business secretary insisted that while the three ministers were fulfilling some of the prime minister 's day-to-day duties , mr brown was ultimately still in charge of the country if there was a crisis .
plaid cymru is in coalition with labour in the " one wales " welsh assembly government , and its leader , ieuan wyn jones , is the deputy first minister .
plaid said its ministers would return from their holidays if they were needed .
" the one wales government does not copy the merry-go-round system adopted by ministers in westminster , " a spokesman said .
" if a crisis should occur whilst a plaid minister is on holiday then they will return to deal with the crisis .
" that is what happened in 2007 when elin jones cut her holiday short to deal with the foot-and-mouth outbreak and that is what will happen if a similar crisis occurs this summer . "
welsh conservatives said they did not object to mr morgan being on call while on holiday .
" there 's never been an issue during the last nine years because of it , " a tory spokesman said .
" he 's only in mwnt after all . "
