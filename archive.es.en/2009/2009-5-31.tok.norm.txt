the exhibition called " 20 years of freedom - germany says ' thank you " ' is a collaborative effort between the german foreign office and partner countries in central and eastern europe .
after being on display in prague until june 1 , the exhibit will make its way to warsaw , gdansk , bratislava and budapest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink .

traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner .

the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag .

arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 31.05.2009 german coalition quibbles over opel rescue deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can opel be saved ?
the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .

the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .

the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

they demolished cottbus 5-0 over two legs , emphatically securing a place in the bundesliga once again . nuremberg had climbed most of the mountain back to the bundesliga on thursday in the first leg , beating cottbus 3-0 away from home .
for sunday 's return fixture , all the club had to do was avoid a disaster at home . cottbus started strongly , and had a few great chances to score early on , but any hope of clawing back into the tie evaporated just before the half-hour mark . christian eigler netted nuremberg 's first goal on 29 minutes , and marek mintal added another eight minutes later , leaving the second-division club five goals to the good against its top-flight opposition . " there was a lot of pressure , but after the two goals it was all over , " eigler said after the match .
" now , it 's time to get the city rocking ! " relegation play-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian eigler opened the scoring , and dashed karlsruhe 's hopes nuremberg qualified for the playoff fixture by finishing third in the second division , whilst cottbus - third from bottom in the bundesliga - had to defend its right to stay in the top division , and could n't . this was the first time since 1991 that a relegation playoff match , once a regular feature of german soccer , had been used to decide who would play where in the following season . nuremberg will join sc freiburg and mainz - both of whom won automatic promotion - in the bundesliga , as cottbus slide down to the second division along with bielefeld and karlsruhe . with cottbus gone , there are now no teams from former east germany in the top flight of german soccer .
cottbus ' first task in its bid to return to first division next season will be to find a new coach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?

" the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they demolished cottbus 5-0 over two legs , emphatically securing a place in the bundesliga once again . nuremberg had climbed most of the mountain back to the bundesliga on thursday in the first leg , beating cottbus 3-0 away from home .
for sunday 's return fixture , all the club had to do was avoid a disaster at home . cottbus started strongly , and had a few great chances to score early on , but any hope of clawing back into the tie evaporated just before the half-hour mark . christian eigler netted nuremberg 's first goal on 29 minutes , and marek mintal added another eight minutes later , leaving the second-division club five goals to the good against its top-flight opposition . " there was a lot of pressure , but after the two goals it was all over , " eigler said after the match .
" now , it 's time to get the city rocking ! " relegation play-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian eigler opened the scoring , and dashed karlsruhe 's hopes nuremberg qualified for the playoff fixture by finishing third in the second division , whilst cottbus - third from bottom in the bundesliga - had to defend its right to stay in the top division , and could n't . this was the first time since 1991 that a relegation playoff match , once a regular feature of german soccer , had been used to decide who would play where in the following season . nuremberg will join sc freiburg and mainz - both of whom won automatic promotion - in the bundesliga , as cottbus slide down to the second division along with bielefeld and karlsruhe . with cottbus gone , there are now no teams from former east germany in the top flight of german soccer .
cottbus ' first task in its bid to return to first division next season will be to find a new coach .

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 31.05.2009 german coalition quibbles over opel rescue deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can opel be saved ?
the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de russian funds save german jobs in opel deal ahead of elections german chancellor angela merkel has called the deal to save car manufacturer opel a " test for trans-atlantic relations . "
berlin and washington seem to have passed it - but with moscow seizing a lead role in the takeover .
-lrb- 30.05.2009 -rrb- magna 's tech know-how may help opel out of crisis magna international may not be a household name , but the russian-backed canadian company , which clinched a deal to take over battered german carmaker opel , is anything but an industry newcomer .
-lrb- 30.05.2009 -rrb- germany gives backing to magna for opel takeover german government officials confirmed early saturday morning that the government in berlin has given its backing to a bid from canadian-austrian car parts maker magna to take over ailing german automaker opel .

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .

the exhibition called " 20 years of freedom - germany says ' thank you " ' is a collaborative effort between the german foreign office and partner countries in central and eastern europe .
after being on display in prague until june 1 , the exhibit will make its way to warsaw , gdansk , bratislava and budapest .
steinmeier also met with czech prime minister jan fischer , and with playwright and former president of czechoslovakia vaclav havel .
on tuesday , he will deliver a speech before the hungarian academy of sciences focusing on the fall of the iron curtain .
important anniversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will visit prague and budapest starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

still , less than half of those asked say they will vote .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .

north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .

" in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de russian funds save german jobs in opel deal ahead of elections german chancellor angela merkel has called the deal to save car manufacturer opel a " test for trans-atlantic relations . "

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .

traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .

recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .

they demolished cottbus 5-0 over two legs , emphatically securing a place in the bundesliga once again . nuremberg had climbed most of the mountain back to the bundesliga on thursday in the first leg , beating cottbus 3-0 away from home .
for sunday 's return fixture , all the club had to do was avoid a disaster at home . cottbus started strongly , and had a few great chances to score early on , but any hope of clawing back into the tie evaporated just before the half-hour mark . christian eigler netted nuremberg 's first goal on 29 minutes , and marek mintal added another eight minutes later , leaving the second-division club five goals to the good against its top-flight opposition . " there was a lot of pressure , but after the two goals it was all over , " eigler said after the match .
" now , it 's time to get the city rocking ! " relegation play-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian eigler opened the scoring , and dashed karlsruhe 's hopes nuremberg qualified for the playoff fixture by finishing third in the second division , whilst cottbus - third from bottom in the bundesliga - had to defend its right to stay in the top division , and could n't . this was the first time since 1991 that a relegation playoff match , once a regular feature of german soccer , had been used to decide who would play where in the following season . nuremberg will join sc freiburg and mainz - both of whom won automatic promotion - in the bundesliga , as cottbus slide down to the second division along with bielefeld and karlsruhe . with cottbus gone , there are now no teams from former east germany in the top flight of german soccer .
cottbus ' first task in its bid to return to first division next season will be to find a new coach .

actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

they demolished cottbus 5-0 over two legs , emphatically securing a place in the bundesliga once again . nuremberg had climbed most of the mountain back to the bundesliga on thursday in the first leg , beating cottbus 3-0 away from home .
for sunday 's return fixture , all the club had to do was avoid a disaster at home . cottbus started strongly , and had a few great chances to score early on , but any hope of clawing back into the tie evaporated just before the half-hour mark . christian eigler netted nuremberg 's first goal on 29 minutes , and marek mintal added another eight minutes later , leaving the second-division club five goals to the good against its top-flight opposition . " there was a lot of pressure , but after the two goals it was all over , " eigler said after the match .
" now , it 's time to get the city rocking ! " relegation play-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian eigler opened the scoring , and dashed karlsruhe 's hopes nuremberg qualified for the playoff fixture by finishing third in the second division , whilst cottbus - third from bottom in the bundesliga - had to defend its right to stay in the top division , and could n't . this was the first time since 1991 that a relegation playoff match , once a regular feature of german soccer , had been used to decide who would play where in the following season . nuremberg will join sc freiburg and mainz - both of whom won automatic promotion - in the bundesliga , as cottbus slide down to the second division along with bielefeld and karlsruhe . with cottbus gone , there are now no teams from former east germany in the top flight of german soccer .
cottbus ' first task in its bid to return to first division next season will be to find a new coach .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

dw-world.de new poll gives hope for higher eu vote turnout a new poll , conducted at the request of the european parliament , says that voter turnout in upcoming eu elections will not be quite as low as previously feared .
still , less than half of those asked say they will vote .
-lrb- 27.05.2009 -rrb- voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

dw-world.de new poll gives hope for higher eu vote turnout a new poll , conducted at the request of the european parliament , says that voter turnout in upcoming eu elections will not be quite as low as previously feared .
still , less than half of those asked say they will vote .
-lrb- 27.05.2009 -rrb- voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exhibition called " 20 years of freedom - germany says ' thank you " ' is a collaborative effort between the german foreign office and partner countries in central and eastern europe .
after being on display in prague until june 1 , the exhibit will make its way to warsaw , gdansk , bratislava and budapest .
steinmeier also met with czech prime minister jan fischer , and with playwright and former president of czechoslovakia vaclav havel .
on tuesday , he will deliver a speech before the hungarian academy of sciences focusing on the fall of the iron curtain .
important anniversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will visit prague and budapest starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this process has been made even more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world. gb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

the german government has pledged to put up 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- to save gm 's german subsidy from going bankrupt .
but not everybody in berlin thinks that handing out millions to opel is money well spent . german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg reportedly offered to resign after chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet ignored his opposition to a government bridging loan for opel as part of a deal to save the german carmaker from the looming bankruptcy of its us parent , general motors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg does n't think that berlin can help everyone guttenberg renewed his criticism in germany 's sunday press , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper that the government was making itself vulnerable by acting in a protectionist manner . " the threat is the state can be blackmailed if it is overly generous with help even once , " guttenberg said . under the terms of the government-sponsored deal , the bridge loan will prevent opel from going insolvent before canadian-austrian car parts manufacturer magna , with the help of it russian backers , takes over gm 's european operations . free beer for everyone ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the german government spending too much money on opel ?
the leader of guttenberg 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , horst seehofer , supported the economics minister in his stance , saying that the opel rescue sets an unfortunate precedent .
seehofer said that plenty of business leaders in his state of bavaria were also in need of financial backing . " how can i explain to these people that the government will help out in one case , but not in others , " seehofer asked assembled journalists in the bavarian city of augsburg . michael fuchs , who heads up the business wing of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats , was even more critical in an interview with welt am sonntag . " with the opel rescue we 're throwing taxpayer money out of the window with a sort of free- beer-for-everyone mentality , " fuchs said .
" that 's not acceptable .
we must stop trying to save companies . " german states pledge money to opel rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel rescue got the go-ahead , but still has its critics north rhine-westphalia and hesse , two of the four german states where opel factories are based , became on sunday the first to pledge money towards the government bridge-loan . hesse promised 447 million euros - almost as much as the 500 million offered by magna - towards keeping opel and the rest of gm europe in business .
north rhine-westphalia offered a further 150 million , but asked for guarantees of job security in the opel plant in its city of bochum in return . " the time of uncertainty is over , " north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers said on sunday . berlin also offered a further 4.5 billion euros in loan guarantees for opel , which currently loses an estimated three million euros per day . gm europe employs around 55,000 people and around 10,000 of these jobs look set to be axed under the magna takeover plan .
of the 26,000 employees that opel has in germany , at least 2,000 are likely to lose their jobs . spd ready to spend more foreign minister frank walter steinmeier took a more positive view on the opel rescue , and criticized guttenberg for his negative attitude . the social democratic leader , who will be campaigning against chancellor merkel in general elections later this year , said that politicians should n't just discuss the risks of the deal in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank walter steinmeier and the spd say that more firms need government aid " what 's really important , " he told the bild am sonntag newspaper , " is finding ways to minimize the risks of a government rescue plan , during those important negotiations which take place away from the -lsb- tv -rsb- cameras and the microphones . " in the same interview , steinmeier addressed the fate of another struggling german company that is reaching out for government funds .
arcandor , the parent of the karstadt chain of department stores , is calling for help from berlin .
the company says that it has major debts to pay in the middle of june , and that it needs help to do so . steinmeier said that up to 50,000 jobs around germany could be lost , unless the government acts to help arcandor .
so far , however , the christian democrats have not advocated a move to help the company . the government in berlin is offering a total of 115 billion euros in support for firms hurt by the global economic crisis , as part of its economic stimulus package .
that money , however , is only meant to help companies that are otherwise healthy and is not meant to prolong the downfall of an ailing business .
deciding which companies are worthy of government support is already looking like a major issue in germany 's 2009 election campaign . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that over 1,100 german companies had already appealed for state aid . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections german elections leave millions without the right to vote looking back : 30 years of european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 31.05.2009 europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 736 deputies from 27 countries make up the eu parliament 375 million people are eligible to vote for the eu parliament this week , but only one half of them is expected to hit the polls - in an electoral system which is as intricate as the 27-member block is widespread . like so much else in the european union , going to the polls to choose an eu parliament is a complicated compromise .
actually , eu law says that voting procedures for the european parliament must be the same in all member countries .
but that is still not the case , 30 years after the first directly elected parliament .
each eu country continues to exercise its own voting procedures and has its own nominating process for choosing candidates .
the only common aspect they share is proportional representation , which is mandatory in all member states .
differences , on the other hand , begin with the legal voting age .
in austria , for example , young people , who turn 16 years of age by election day , are entitled to vote .
in all the other states , the minimum age is 18 years .
candidates in all but two countries must also be at least 18 years old , except in cyprus and italy , where the minimum age to be a parliamentarian is 25 .
there are also no unified rules on how many votes a party must get to be represented in parliament .
in most countries there is a so-called five-percent hurdle , as a percentage of votes cast , but in austria , it 's four percent .
voters can vote anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenary sessions of the eu parliament sometimes take place in brussels there is agreement , at least , on where a voter can vote .
in fact , all the eligible voters of eu countries can vote in any country they choose , regardless of whether they are a citizen of that country or not .
that means a dane can vote in ireland , a german in the netherlands , or a greek in spain .
the 375 million eligible voters choose 736 parliamentary deputies .
how many deputies there are per country depends - again - on a complicated formula .
germany , the eu 's largest country is entitled to select 99 deputies .
france , italy and britain send 78 to strasbourg , the seat of parliament , while spain and poland are allowed 54 representatives .
the proportional representation continues down the line to the smallest eu member , malta , which gets to choose five deputies .
four days of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will elect 99 representatives for the eu parliament the eu member states could also not agree on a common election day .
so , instead , they introduced an " election week , " which , according to eu law , extends this year from thursday , june 4 to sunday , june 7 .
traditionally , the dutch and the britons go to the polls on thursday , ireland votes on friday , while italy takes both friday and saturday .
most of the other countries vote on sunday .
the last voting booths close on sunday at 10pm central european time .
only then can the first results be announced - even from those countries that had voted days earlier .
dutch media , however , publish their projections after polls close in the netherlands on thursday .
the german media announce their first projections at 6pm on sunday , but it takes ten days before the final , official results are made known because portugal needs that much time to counts its ballots .
low voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european unity means getting 27 nations to agree on the same things the national election commissioners pass on the results from their respective countries to the eu parliament office in brussels beginning at 10pm on sunday .
the office then calculates how the seats in the newly elected parliament are to be distributed .
recent surveys suggest that the conservatives , as before , will be the largest parliamentary group , followed by the socialists .
the big unknown is voter turnout .
for the last 30 years , since the eu parliament has been directly elected , voter participation has dropped steadily .
research shows that a low turnout gives splinter groups a better chance of winning seats because they can generally mobilize their supporters better .
the last opinion poll conducted at the behest of the european parliament forecasts an average voter turnout of about 43 percent across the eu .
the survey found that the most important issues on voters ' minds were unemployment and the consequences of the global economic crisis .
essentially , there are 27 separate election campaigns going on for the european parliament because of the different election systems and the lack of any pan-european list of candidates .
the outcome of the elections will be determined by " the different political issues in each member state and often the protests against the governing national government , " said jacki davis , a political scientist at the european policy institute in brussels .

the exhibition called " 20 years of freedom - germany says ' thank you " ' is a collaborative effort between the german foreign office and partner countries in central and eastern europe .
after being on display in prague until june 1 , the exhibit will make its way to warsaw , gdansk , bratislava and budapest .
steinmeier also met with czech prime minister jan fischer , and with playwright and former president of czechoslovakia vaclav havel .
on tuesday , he will deliver a speech before the hungarian academy of sciences focusing on the fall of the iron curtain .
important anniversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will visit prague and budapest starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this process has been made even more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world. gb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they demolished cottbus 5-0 over two legs , emphatically securing a place in the bundesliga once again . nuremberg had climbed most of the mountain back to the bundesliga on thursday in the first leg , beating cottbus 3-0 away from home .
for sunday 's return fixture , all the club had to do was avoid a disaster at home . cottbus started strongly , and had a few great chances to score early on , but any hope of clawing back into the tie evaporated just before the half-hour mark . christian eigler netted nuremberg 's first goal on 29 minutes , and marek mintal added another eight minutes later , leaving the second-division club five goals to the good against its top-flight opposition . " there was a lot of pressure , but after the two goals it was all over , " eigler said after the match .
" now , it 's time to get the city rocking ! " relegation play-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian eigler opened the scoring , and dashed karlsruhe 's hopes nuremberg qualified for the playoff fixture by finishing third in the second division , whilst cottbus - third from bottom in the bundesliga - had to defend its right to stay in the top division , and could n't . this was the first time since 1991 that a relegation playoff match , once a regular feature of german soccer , had been used to decide who would play where in the following season . nuremberg will join sc freiburg and mainz - both of whom won automatic promotion - in the bundesliga , as cottbus slide down to the second division along with bielefeld and karlsruhe . with cottbus gone , there are now no teams from former east germany in the top flight of german soccer .
cottbus ' first task in its bid to return to first division next season will be to find a new coach .

next year , suleiman fahmawi hopes to march to his parents ' old village " they 're welcome to jail us , " says suleiman fahmawi .
he is planning next year 's nakba march , even though it could be illegal .
every year , as israelis celebrate their independence with flags and barbecues , he organises mourning marches to destroyed arab villages .
in the 1948 nakba , or " catastrophe " , 700,000 palestinians fled or were forced from their homes as israel claimed its independence .
a controversial bill backed by a government committee in israel 's knesset last week is seeking to ban marking it in israel .
next year 's planned march is to the village mr fahmawi says his parents were forced from three years before his birth .
they remained in israel , meaning he was born into the conflicted situation of the state 's israeli-arab minority - israeli citizens who identify themselves with palestinians .
' fifth column ' the bill , proposed by foreign minister avigdor lieberman 's far-right party yisrael beiteinu , is part of what many see as a drive to demand deeper loyalty from israeli arabs .
they are deleting our memory ...
they 're going to delete our language , our arabic street names ...
we 'll become jewish nasreen abu bakr israeli-arab artist cabinet rejects loyalty oath anger over nakba ban proposal profile : avigdor lieberman they make up 20 % of israel 's population and face widely documented discrimination , but are feared by some israelis as a potentially hostile " fifth column " .
mr lieberman 's party also wants all israeli citizens to pledge allegiance to israel as a jewish state and perform some form of national service .
member of parliament alex miller , who proposed what is being called the nakba bill , says citizens who want equal rights should shoulder " equal responsibilities " , and not " go on demonstrations against the existence of the state " .
the town of um al-fahm , where mr fahmawi lives , is in some ways a symbol of the issues that irk yisrael beiteinu .
clusters of new-looking red-roofed villas declare at least modest prosperity amid the battered pavements and dense jumble of concrete houses .
many residents work in construction , commuting to israel 's mainly jewish towns .
but the green flags of the islamic movement , which controls the council , flutter on lampposts .
' they control everything ' last nakba day , its deputy leader declared " the zionist sun will set , as the sun of the islamic state rises " .
its head has previously accused jews of using children 's blood to bake bread and called for jerusalem to be the seat of a wide-reaching muslim state , or caliphate .
in offices adorned with photos of the iconic dome of the rock mosque in jerusalem , sits abdelhakeem mufeed , editor of the movement 's newspaper .
abdelhakeem mufeed says his loyalty is " to palestine , not israel " his voice rises at the suggestion his leaders ' statements might alarm israelis .
" you care for the israelis ?
why are they afraid when they control everything ?
the palestinians are the ones who are suffering ! "
he believes clashes - and possibly even a third intifada or uprising - will result if the bills are pushed through .
" our loyalty is to our nation , palestine , not israel .
we can not be loyal to the country that demolished our houses , the one responsible for our nakba , " he says .
but the islamic movement by no means represents the feelings of all israeli arabs .
israeli-arabs about 1.2m , a fifth of israel 's population , are israeli-arabs they are citizens of israel , but face widely documented discrimination outgoing pm ehud olmert said there is " no doubt " israeli-arabs have faced discrimination for " many years " israeli-arabs own 3.5 % of israel 's land , get 3-5 % of government spending and have higher poverty levels than jewish israelis * there are 13 israeli-arabs in the 120-seat knesset , 10 representing -lsb- primarly -rsb- arab parties * source : mossawa center israeli-arabs vote in anger clash in tense israeli-arab town further down the town 's steep streets , said abu shakra shows me round the white-walled art gallery he founded 13 years ago .
it promotes dialogue by hosting work by palestinian , jewish and international artists .
" of course , i accept israel 's existence , " he says .
" in spite of all our history we have to look forward . "
mr abu shakra understands why statements such as those of the islamic movement worry israelis , but feels they are taken to represent the wider population in a way that the rhetoric of jewish extremists is not .
installation artist and painter nasreen abu bakr , 31 , has just returned from visiting a jewish friend .
" in reality there is a state of israel , but i inside i still have a problem with it .
there is a conflict between my identity and my life in israel , " she says .
ms abu bakr says the two bills will be a " disaster " if they pass - although they face many hurdles .
" they are deleting our memory and they 're not going to stop here .
they 're going to delete our language , our arabic street names .
we 'll become jewish . "
' it 's part of staying ' many people in um al-fahm do not feel they owe israel anything beyond the taxes they already pay .
they blame israeli under-investment for the lack of work in the town , and say they have little option but to work for jewish israelis .
" israel does not give us our rights , " says mr fahmawi , " we take them " .
many of um al-fahm 's residents work in construction around israel in his comfortable house he says he battled discrimination to become a civil engineer and now works for both jewish and arab companies .
" it 's business , " he says .
" and i want to stay in this land - living and working is part of staying . "
analysts say the gap between jewish and arab israelis is growing .
an annual haifa university survey recently found only 53 % of israeli-arabs recognised israel 's right to exist , down from 81 % in 2003 , while 40 % denied the holocaust , up from 28 % in 2006 .
israeli-arabs cite the recent gaza and lebanon wars and ongoing discrimination as reasons , while some in israel fear such findings show israeli-arabs becoming more radical .
even with israel 's right-leaning government , the two draft bills are drawing vocal opposition and may never become law .
but many fear that they are already widening the gulf .

next year , suleiman fahmawi hopes to march to his parents ' old village " they 're welcome to jail us , " says suleiman fahmawi .
he is planning next year 's nakba march , even though it could be illegal .
every year , as israelis celebrate their independence with flags and barbecues , he organises mourning marches to destroyed arab villages .
in the 1948 nakba , or " catastrophe " , 700,000 palestinians fled or were forced from their homes as israel claimed its independence .
a controversial bill backed by a government committee in israel 's knesset last week is seeking to ban marking it in israel .
next year 's planned march is to the village mr fahmawi says his parents were forced from three years before his birth .
they remained in israel , meaning he was born into the conflicted situation of the state 's israeli-arab minority - israeli citizens who identify themselves with palestinians .
' fifth column ' the bill , proposed by foreign minister avigdor lieberman 's far-right party yisrael beiteinu , is part of what many see as a drive to demand deeper loyalty from israeli arabs .
they are deleting our memory ...
they 're going to delete our language , our arabic street names ...
we 'll become jewish nasreen abu bakr israeli-arab artist cabinet rejects loyalty oath anger over nakba ban proposal profile : avigdor lieberman they make up 20 % of israel 's population and face widely documented discrimination , but are feared by some israelis as a potentially hostile " fifth column " .
mr lieberman 's party also wants all israeli citizens to pledge allegiance to israel as a jewish state and perform some form of national service .
member of parliament alex miller , who proposed what is being called the nakba bill , says citizens who want equal rights should shoulder " equal responsibilities " , and not " go on demonstrations against the existence of the state " .
the town of um al-fahm , where mr fahmawi lives , is in some ways a symbol of the issues that irk yisrael beiteinu .
clusters of new-looking red-roofed villas declare at least modest prosperity amid the battered pavements and dense jumble of concrete houses .
many residents work in construction , commuting to israel 's mainly jewish towns .
but the green flags of the islamic movement , which controls the council , flutter on lampposts .
' they control everything ' last nakba day , its deputy leader declared " the zionist sun will set , as the sun of the islamic state rises " .

next year , suleiman fahmawi hopes to march to his parents ' old village " they 're welcome to jail us , " says suleiman fahmawi .
he is planning next year 's nakba march , even though it could be illegal .
every year , as israelis celebrate their independence with flags and barbecues , he organises mourning marches to destroyed arab villages .
in the 1948 nakba , or " catastrophe " , 700,000 palestinians fled or were forced from their homes as israel claimed its independence .
a controversial bill backed by a government committee in israel 's knesset last week is seeking to ban marking it in israel .
next year 's planned march is to the village mr fahmawi says his parents were forced from three years before his birth .
they remained in israel , meaning he was born into the conflicted situation of the state 's israeli-arab minority - israeli citizens who identify themselves with palestinians .
' fifth column ' the bill , proposed by foreign minister avigdor lieberman 's far-right party yisrael beiteinu , is part of what many see as a drive to demand deeper loyalty from israeli arabs .
they are deleting our memory ...
they 're going to delete our language , our arabic street names ...
we 'll become jewish nasreen abu bakr israeli-arab artist cabinet rejects loyalty oath anger over nakba ban proposal profile : avigdor lieberman they make up 20 % of israel 's population and face widely documented discrimination , but are feared by some israelis as a potentially hostile " fifth column " .
mr lieberman 's party also wants all israeli citizens to pledge allegiance to israel as a jewish state and perform some form of national service .
member of parliament alex miller , who proposed what is being called the nakba bill , says citizens who want equal rights should shoulder " equal responsibilities " , and not " go on demonstrations against the existence of the state " .
the town of um al-fahm , where mr fahmawi lives , is in some ways a symbol of the issues that irk yisrael beiteinu .
clusters of new-looking red-roofed villas declare at least modest prosperity amid the battered pavements and dense jumble of concrete houses .
many residents work in construction , commuting to israel 's mainly jewish towns .
but the green flags of the islamic movement , which controls the council , flutter on lampposts .
' they control everything ' last nakba day , its deputy leader declared " the zionist sun will set , as the sun of the islamic state rises " .
its head has previously accused jews of using children 's blood to bake bread and called for jerusalem to be the seat of a wide-reaching muslim state , or caliphate .
in offices adorned with photos of the iconic dome of the rock mosque in jerusalem , sits abdelhakeem mufeed , editor of the movement 's newspaper .
abdelhakeem mufeed says his loyalty is " to palestine , not israel " his voice rises at the suggestion his leaders ' statements might alarm israelis .
" you care for the israelis ?
why are they afraid when they control everything ?
the palestinians are the ones who are suffering ! "
he believes clashes - and possibly even a third intifada or uprising - will result if the bills are pushed through .
" our loyalty is to our nation , palestine , not israel .
we can not be loyal to the country that demolished our houses , the one responsible for our nakba , " he says .
but the islamic movement by no means represents the feelings of all israeli arabs .
israeli-arabs about 1.2m , a fifth of israel 's population , are israeli-arabs they are citizens of israel , but face widely documented discrimination outgoing pm ehud olmert said there is " no doubt " israeli-arabs have faced discrimination for " many years " israeli-arabs own 3.5 % of israel 's land , get 3-5 % of government spending and have higher poverty levels than jewish israelis * there are 13 israeli-arabs in the 120-seat knesset , 10 representing -lsb- primarly -rsb- arab parties * source : mossawa center israeli-arabs vote in anger clash in tense israeli-arab town further down the town 's steep streets , said abu shakra shows me round the white-walled art gallery he founded 13 years ago .

" they 're welcome to jail us , " says suleiman fahmawi .
he is planning next year 's nakba march , even though it could be illegal .
every year , as israelis celebrate their independence with flags and barbecues , he organises mourning marches to destroyed arab villages .
in the 1948 nakba , or " catastrophe " , 700,000 palestinians fled or were forced from their homes as israel claimed its independence .
a controversial bill backed by a government committee in israel 's knesset last week is seeking to ban marking it in israel .
next year 's planned march is to the village mr fahmawi says his parents were forced from three years before his birth .
they remained in israel , meaning he was born into the conflicted situation of the state 's israeli-arab minority - israeli citizens who identify themselves with palestinians .
' fifth column ' the bill , proposed by foreign minister avigdor lieberman 's far-right party yisrael beiteinu , is part of what many see as a drive to demand deeper loyalty from israeli arabs . "
they are deleting our memory ...
they 're going to delete our language , our arabic street names ...
we 'll become jewish " nasreen abu bakr israeli-arab artist cabinet rejects loyalty oath anger over nakba ban proposal profile : avigdor lieberman they make up 20 % of israel 's population and face widely documented discrimination , but are feared by some israelis as a potentially hostile " fifth column " .
mr lieberman 's party also wants all israeli citizens to pledge allegiance to israel as a jewish state and perform some form of national service .
member of parliament alex miller , who proposed what is being called the nakba bill , says citizens who want equal rights should shoulder " equal responsibilities " , and not " go on demonstrations against the existence of the state " .
the town of um al-fahm , where mr fahmawi lives , is in some ways a symbol of the issues that irk yisrael beiteinu .
clusters of new-looking red-roofed villas declare at least modest prosperity amid the battered pavements and dense jumble of concrete houses .
many residents work in construction , commuting to israel 's mainly jewish towns .
but the green flags of the islamic movement , which controls the council , flutter on lampposts .
' they control everything ' last nakba day , its deputy leader declared " the zionist sun will set , as the sun of the islamic state rises " .
its head has previously accused jews of using children 's blood to bake bread and called for jerusalem to be the seat of a wide-reaching muslim state , or caliphate .
in offices adorned with photos of the iconic dome of the rock mosque in jerusalem , sits abdelhakeem mufeed , editor of the movement 's newspaper .
his voice rises at the suggestion his leaders ' statements might alarm israelis .
" you care for the israelis ?
why are they afraid when they control everything ?
the palestinians are the ones who are suffering ! "
he believes clashes - and possibly even a third intifada or uprising - will result if the bills are pushed through .
" our loyalty is to our nation , palestine , not israel .
we can not be loyal to the country that demolished our houses , the one responsible for our nakba , " he says .
but the islamic movement by no means represents the feelings of all israeli arabs .
israeli-arabs about 1.2m , a fifth of israel 's population , are israeli-arabs they are citizens of israel , but face widely documented discrimination outgoing pm ehud olmert said there is " no doubt " israeli-arabs have faced discrimination for " many years " israeli-arabs own 3.5 % of israel 's land , get 3-5 % of government spending and have higher poverty levels than jewish israelis * there are 13 israeli-arabs in the 120-seat knesset , 10 representing -lsb- primarly -rsb- arab parties * source : mossawa center israeli-arabs vote in anger clash in tense israeli-arab town further down the town 's steep streets , said abu shakra shows me round the white-walled art gallery he founded 13 years ago .
it promotes dialogue by hosting work by palestinian , jewish and international artists .
" of course , i accept israel 's existence , " he says .
" in spite of all our history we have to look forward . "
mr abu shakra understands why statements such as those of the islamic movement worry israelis , but feels they are taken to represent the wider population in a way that the rhetoric of jewish extremists is not .
installation artist and painter nasreen abu bakr , 31 , has just returned from visiting a jewish friend .
" in reality there is a state of israel , but i inside i still have a problem with it .
there is a conflict between my identity and my life in israel , " she says .
ms abu bakr says the two bills will be a " disaster " if they pass - although they face many hurdles .
" they are deleting our memory and they 're not going to stop here .
they 're going to delete our language , our arabic street names .
we 'll become jewish . "
' it 's part of staying ' many people in um al-fahm do not feel they owe israel anything beyond the taxes they already pay .
they blame israeli under-investment for the lack of work in the town , and say they have little option but to work for jewish israelis .
" israel does not give us our rights , " says mr fahmawi , " we take them " .
in his comfortable house he says he battled discrimination to become a civil engineer and now works for both jewish and arab companies .
" it 's business , " he says .
" and i want to stay in this land - living and working is part of staying . "
analysts say the gap between jewish and arab israelis is growing .
an annual haifa university survey recently found only 53 % of israeli-arabs recognised israel 's right to exist , down from 81 % in 2003 , while 40 % denied the holocaust , up from 28 % in 2006 .
israeli-arabs cite the recent gaza and lebanon wars and ongoing discrimination as reasons , while some in israel fear such findings show israeli-arabs becoming more radical .
even with israel 's right-leaning government , the two draft bills are drawing vocal opposition and may never become law .
but many fear that they are already widening the gulf .

the work , set in the 1940s , is the first of her novels not to contain any openly gay characters .
but waters , who grew up in pembrokeshire , told an audience at the hay literary festival , that she was horrified by the thought that she was ready to abandon gay characters " just to get a few more readers " .
she insisted that her latest work which investigates middle class britain after world war ii was not a " lesbian story " and it would have been " tokenistic " to have put gay characters in it .
however , she said the little stranger , which is a ghost story , is not without some romantic interest , between the daughter of the struggling aristocratic family at the centre of the novel and the novel 's narrator .
waters said she wanted caroline , the daughter " with thick ankles and a bad dress sense " to be a traditional woman but she might just be a " nascent lesbian " .
' nice continuity ' the novelist outlined the painstaking research she had put into the little stranger describing her and her partner 's visits to national trust and privately-owned large country homes .
she described the joy she gets from her research - the novel which became the televised tipping the velvet grew out of her academic research .
and , for her latest work , she described how at the end of a day of research she would immerse herself in a 1940s novel or watch a period film to relax .
questioned by a member of the audience about students now studying her work , waters admitted that it was " amazing ...
i keep saying do n't waste your time " .
but she admitted there was a " nice continuity " in that because she had started her own writing career though her academic writing .
" it 's almost seamless for me , " she said .
while her works have moved from the victorian era into wartime and post war britain , waters also admitted she was not yet ready to write a contemporary novel , although maybe she would be one day .
and there was a big surprise for her as she was questioned by a member of the audience by a school contemporary at milford haven about the influence of her english teacher on her career .
she paid tribute to the school and said her english and art teachers had been a " great inspiration " .
meanwhile brick lane author monica ali spoke of year-long research for her new novel in the kitchen .
the main character is a chef with a multi-national staff , whose life unravels , and she spent time in five large hotels in london .
" hotels are a microcosm of the world , from the penthouse at the top to porters sorting through rubbish at the bottom , and everything in between , " she said .
" the hardest thing was getting in there - there were negotiations , you have to build up trust . "
