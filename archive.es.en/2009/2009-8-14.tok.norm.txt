the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .

" we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

gavin blackburn has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 14.08.2009 french cafe culture struggles to stay alive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say french cafes need to move with the times sitting in a cafe in france is part of every tourist cliche .
but with locals doing that less and less and the number of cafes dwindling at a rapid pace , is french cafe culture in danger of dying out ? in 1960 , there were about 200,000 cafes across france .
fifty years later , there are only around 40,000 left and , according to industry statistics , two cafes go out of business every day .
on a sunny day in paris , everything still appears normal .
at le grand palais , a cafe in paris 's swanky eighth district , the terraces are full with tourists sipping lemonade , office types having lunch , and people sitting quietly on their own , reading as they take in the warm weather .
across town at le belair in the belleville neighborhood of paris , though , there 's a much different scene .
just before lunch , there are only two customers at the bar .
it 's the kind of sparsely-decorated one-room cafe with a bar that can be found in working-class neighborhoods all around the country .
owner zahir idris says business is extremely slow these days .
" with the smoking ban and the way the police are cracking down on alcohol at the wheel , our sales have been halved , " he says .
" just look around .
before lunch there used to be people having cocktails .
now there is almost no one .
in the good days , we used to serve 40 or 50 lunches .
now we barely serve 10 lunches a day .
how can we make any money like that ? "
idris says he 's just barely able to stay open and that he 's often struggling to pay the bills .
the french government recently lowered the sales tax on all non-alcoholic products sold in cafes .
but idris says it wo n't make much difference to him as his sales are already so low .
his plight is repeated at cafes all around france .
traditional cafes and bars are struggling and many have to close .
the total number of french cafes is down five-fold since 1960 .
and it 's quite common to see boarded-up cafes that will never open again , especially in small towns .
owners need to move with the times bernard quartier , president of the national federation of cafes , brasseries and discotheques , does n't believe the trend is the result of new smoking or drink driving legislation .
he says cafe owners simply have n't been keeping up with the times .
" i think cafes are out of sync with society . " he says .
" they were in sync during the 1950s , but they are n't anymore .
a cafe has to be clean .
the coffee has to be good .
in many cases the coffee is n't good .
the beer has to be good .
and you have to be able to order non-alcoholic drinks , like fresh-squeezed orange juice or smoothies .
you have to be able to find a newspaper in a cafe , or find a television where sporting events are broadcast .
there has to be something to draw people . "
quartier also argues that service needs to improve ; customers want to be welcomed with a smile and use spotless restrooms .
he adds that cafe owners who offer customers what they want are doing well , but that those who 've kept the same tired furniture and focus almost exclusively on alcohol are in trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aside from good coffee , cafes need to offer customers a concept , quartier says quartier himself has owned eight different cafes , starting with the first one he bought at age 23 .
today , he 's visiting his newest venture : an italian-themed cafe in paris 's upscale seventh district .
the current owner is selling because the business is n't making enough money .
quartier says he plans to reduce prices and serve food and drink from his home region , the loire valley .
he also wants to organize art shows and literary evenings here to draw people .
his focus is n't just coffee .
he has a whole concept in mind .
additional threat from the internet while diversifying a cafe 's offerings may certainly be good advice , there appear to be other trends at work adding to the demise of cafe culture .
previous generations of cafe owners did n't have to compete with social networking sites such as facebook , twitter , or linked in , for example .
these sites give people the impression they 're socializing from the comfort of their own homes , making it unnecessary to venture out to a cafe .
christine pujol , the head of umih , an industry group that represents france 's cafes and restaurants , says the disappearance of cafe culture is worrying on a broader level .
" we often say that cafes are a part of france 's national heritage - from a social , cultural and even architectural perspective , " pujol says .
" it 's very saddening to think that these places could disappear and that they will stop playing the social role they have been playing for so long . "
the french writer honore de balzac once said that cafes are the parliament of the people .
this is still true to a certain extent .
political parties sometimes organize public gatherings in cafes and it 's the place to go when meeting up with someone far from home .
but if the current trend continues , there 's a risk france 's cafe culture could turn into something of a relic .
instead of finding one on almost every corner , as is the case today , they 'd be limited to tourist sites .

but with locals doing that less and less and the number of cafes dwindling at a rapid pace , is french cafe culture in danger of dying out ? in 1960 , there were about 200,000 cafes across france .
fifty years later , there are only around 40,000 left and , according to industry statistics , two cafes go out of business every day .
on a sunny day in paris , everything still appears normal .
at le grand palais , a cafe in paris 's swanky eighth district , the terraces are full with tourists sipping lemonade , office types having lunch , and people sitting quietly on their own , reading as they take in the warm weather .
across town at le belair in the belleville neighborhood of paris , though , there 's a much different scene .
just before lunch , there are only two customers at the bar .
it 's the kind of sparsely-decorated one-room cafe with a bar that can be found in working-class neighborhoods all around the country .
owner zahir idris says business is extremely slow these days .
" with the smoking ban and the way the police are cracking down on alcohol at the wheel , our sales have been halved , " he says .
" just look around .
before lunch there used to be people having cocktails .
now there is almost no one .
in the good days , we used to serve 40 or 50 lunches .
now we barely serve 10 lunches a day .
how can we make any money like that ? "
idris says he 's just barely able to stay open and that he 's often struggling to pay the bills .
the french government recently lowered the sales tax on all non-alcoholic products sold in cafes .
but idris says it wo n't make much difference to him as his sales are already so low .
his plight is repeated at cafes all around france .
traditional cafes and bars are struggling and many have to close .
the total number of french cafes is down five-fold since 1960 .
and it 's quite common to see boarded-up cafes that will never open again , especially in small towns .
owners need to move with the times bernard quartier , president of the national federation of cafes , brasseries and discotheques , does n't believe the trend is the result of new smoking or drink driving legislation .
he says cafe owners simply have n't been keeping up with the times .
" i think cafes are out of sync with society . " he says .
" they were in sync during the 1950s , but they are n't anymore .
a cafe has to be clean .
the coffee has to be good .
in many cases the coffee is n't good .
the beer has to be good .
and you have to be able to order non-alcoholic drinks , like fresh-squeezed orange juice or smoothies .
you have to be able to find a newspaper in a cafe , or find a television where sporting events are broadcast .
there has to be something to draw people . "
quartier also argues that service needs to improve ; customers want to be welcomed with a smile and use spotless restrooms .
he adds that cafe owners who offer customers what they want are doing well , but that those who 've kept the same tired furniture and focus almost exclusively on alcohol are in trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aside from good coffee , cafes need to offer customers a concept , quartier says quartier himself has owned eight different cafes , starting with the first one he bought at age 23 .
today , he 's visiting his newest venture : an italian-themed cafe in paris 's upscale seventh district .
the current owner is selling because the business is n't making enough money .
quartier says he plans to reduce prices and serve food and drink from his home region , the loire valley .
he also wants to organize art shows and literary evenings here to draw people .
his focus is n't just coffee .
he has a whole concept in mind .
additional threat from the internet while diversifying a cafe 's offerings may certainly be good advice , there appear to be other trends at work adding to the demise of cafe culture .
previous generations of cafe owners did n't have to compete with social networking sites such as facebook , twitter , or linked in , for example .
these sites give people the impression they 're socializing from the comfort of their own homes , making it unnecessary to venture out to a cafe .
christine pujol , the head of umih , an industry group that represents france 's cafes and restaurants , says the disappearance of cafe culture is worrying on a broader level .
" we often say that cafes are a part of france 's national heritage - from a social , cultural and even architectural perspective , " pujol says .
" it 's very saddening to think that these places could disappear and that they will stop playing the social role they have been playing for so long . "
the french writer honore de balzac once said that cafes are the parliament of the people .
this is still true to a certain extent .
political parties sometimes organize public gatherings in cafes and it 's the place to go when meeting up with someone far from home .

neale lytollis in berlin has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

the nine-day meet in berlin features the world 's fastest man and several german medal hopefuls . the biggest name among the roughly 2,000 athletes scheduled to compete in the 12th international association of athletics federations -lrb- iaaf -rrb- world championships is jamaica 's usain bolt .
at last year 's olympic games in beijing , bolt was the star of the track and field events and earned the title of world 's fastest man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tyson gay is aiming to defend his 100-meter and 200-meter titles in beijing , bolt brought home three gold medals for the 100-meter dash , 200 meters , and the 4x100 relay .
all three races yielded world records , and bolt literally coasted across the finish line of the 100 meters in one of the games ' most memorable moments .
american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .
his showdown with bolt in the 100 on sunday night will be one of the highlights of the meet in berlin , and it comes exactly one year after bolt 's olympic victory in the 100 .
the two are to face each other again in the 200 on thursday evening .
field events best shot for germany although bolt will be one of the most recognizable figures at the meet , the home team at the world championships is well represented .
the german athletics team is coming off a disappointing performance at the olympics , only bringing home a single medal .
they 'll be hoping to return to the form they displayed at the 2007 world championships , where they captured seven medals , including two golds .
germany 's best chances for medals in berlin will be in the field events , and high jumper ariane friedrich is a heavy favorite .
she has already had good luck in berlin this year , as well .
at a golden league meet in the german capital in june , friedrich beat defending world champion blanka vlasic of croatia with a jump of 2.06 meters , breaking an 18-year-old german record .
bildunterschrift : ariane friedrich celebrates her german record jump at a meet in berlin in june friedrich , recognizable by her trademark pink knee-high stockings during the competition , says she is " hoping for a medal . "
lone olympic medalist returns the bright spot on germany 's olympic team in beijing was javelin thrower christina obergfoell , who took home the bronze .
she enters the competition in berlin ranked number one in the world in her event .
fellow javelin thrower steffi nerius will be in the medal hunt as well and is ranked fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina obergfoell 's bronze in the javelin was germany 's only olympic medal in beijing long jumper sebastian bayer has been a surprise success this season for the german team .
he had a breakthrough jump at the european indoor championships in march , winning with a mark of 8.71 meters .
he backed it up with an outdoor personal best 8.49 meters at the german championships , placing him fourth in the list of the best jumps in the world this year .
if he can put together another solid meet in berlin , he could have a shot at the podium .
other german medal hopefuls include betty heidler and kathrin klaas in the hammer throw , and nadine kleinart and denise hinrichs in the shot put .
late withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikitenko -lrb- left -rrb- was eying gold , but now mockenhaupt is german favorite while the germans should stack up well against the competition in the field events , things do n't look as good when it comes to the track .
irina mikitenko had been seen as one of the favorites for the women ’ s marathon , but she has withdrawn from the competition due to the recent death of her father .
sabrina mockenhaupt is still scheduled to toe the marathon starting line for germany , and is to focus exclusively on that race .
she had previously qualified for the 10,000-meters race , but has opted not to run it .

the nine-day meet in berlin features the world 's fastest man and several german medal hopefuls . the biggest name among the roughly 2,000 athletes scheduled to compete in the 12th international association of athletics federations -lrb- iaaf -rrb- world championships is jamaica 's usain bolt .
at last year 's olympic games in beijing , bolt was the star of the track and field events and earned the title of world 's fastest man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tyson gay is aiming to defend his 100-meter and 200-meter titles in beijing , bolt brought home three gold medals for the 100-meter dash , 200 meters , and the 4x100 relay .
all three races yielded world records , and bolt literally coasted across the finish line of the 100 meters in one of the games ' most memorable moments .
american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .
his showdown with bolt in the 100 on sunday night will be one of the highlights of the meet in berlin , and it comes exactly one year after bolt 's olympic victory in the 100 .
the two are to face each other again in the 200 on thursday evening .
field events best shot for germany although bolt will be one of the most recognizable figures at the meet , the home team at the world championships is well represented .
the german athletics team is coming off a disappointing performance at the olympics , only bringing home a single medal .
they 'll be hoping to return to the form they displayed at the 2007 world championships , where they captured seven medals , including two golds .
germany 's best chances for medals in berlin will be in the field events , and high jumper ariane friedrich is a heavy favorite .
she has already had good luck in berlin this year , as well .
at a golden league meet in the german capital in june , friedrich beat defending world champion blanka vlasic of croatia with a jump of 2.06 meters , breaking an 18-year-old german record .

she enters the competition in berlin ranked number one in the world in her event .
fellow javelin thrower steffi nerius will be in the medal hunt as well and is ranked fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina obergfoell 's bronze in the javelin was germany 's only olympic medal in beijing long jumper sebastian bayer has been a surprise success this season for the german team .
he had a breakthrough jump at the european indoor championships in march , winning with a mark of 8.71 meters .
he backed it up with an outdoor personal best 8.49 meters at the german championships , placing him fourth in the list of the best jumps in the world this year .
if he can put together another solid meet in berlin , he could have a shot at the podium .
other german medal hopefuls include betty heidler and kathrin klaas in the hammer throw , and nadine kleinart and denise hinrichs in the shot put .

irina mikitenko had been seen as one of the favorites for the women ’ s marathon , but she has withdrawn from the competition due to the recent death of her father .
sabrina mockenhaupt is still scheduled to toe the marathon starting line for germany , and is to focus exclusively on that race .
she had previously qualified for the 10,000-meters race , but has opted not to run it .

neale lytollis in berlin has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .

in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

at last year 's olympic games in beijing , bolt was the star of the track and field events and earned the title of world 's fastest man .

american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.08.2009 threat to pakistani nuclear arsenal is real , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's military displays its ghauri missile , which can carry nuclear warheads pakistan 's nuclear weapons facilities were attacked three times in 2007 and 2008 by extremists , a recently published report says .
the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .

shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .

jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .

more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 14.08.2009 the bermuda triangle of the north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic sea has been missing for more than two weeks a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 14.08.2009 the bermuda triangle of the north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic sea has been missing for more than two weeks a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.08.2009 poles , germans rebury 2,000 wwii victims found in mass grave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies from the mass grave were taken from malbork the remains of more than 2,000 german civilians discovered in a mass grave in the town of malbork in northern poland have been reburied at a ceremony at one of the country 's german military cemeteries on friday . the victims are believed to have been caught up in the russian army 's offensive in what was then the german province of east prussia in the final stages of world war ii ; a province split between poland and russia after the war .
the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three were convicted of insurance fraud to raise funds for supporting the terrorist network . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe on friday confirmed two of the men 's sentences of six and seven years .
it said the third man 's sentence should be reassessed .
the defendants had appealed their 2007 conviction , arguing that the police had breached privacy laws when they bugged the men 's homes .
the principal defendant , 32-year-old syrian-national ibrahim mohamed k. , had been sentenced to seven years imprisonment for membership in a terrorist organization and attempted fraud in 28 cases .
yasser abu s. , a palestinian , received a six-year sentence for the same crimes .
his brother , ismail abu s. , was sentenced to three and a half years in jail for attempted fraud .
the court said it had only been proven that ismail abu s. had supported a terrorist organization , not that he had also been a member , and it referred his case back to a lower court for his sentence to be revised .
the men had attempted to raise at least 4.3 million euros -lrb- $ 6.1 million -rrb- for the al-qaeda terrorist network in a massive life insurance scam .

porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .

meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 14.08.2009 the bermuda triangle of the north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic sea has been missing for more than two weeks a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 14.08.2009 the bermuda triangle of the north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic sea has been missing for more than two weeks a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 14.08.2009 germany 's far right becomes internet savvy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media-savyy right-wing extremists no longer use more obvious neo-nazi symbols the number of right-wing extremist websites in germany is rising , with a group charged with youth protection warning that the internet has become the leading platform for right-wing extremist propaganda . germany 's right-wing extremist scene is developing a professional , media-savvy internet presence , according to jugendschutz.de , an internet watch group for german youth .
with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

but with locals doing that less and less and the number of cafes dwindling at a rapid pace , is french cafe culture in danger of dying out ? in 1960 , there were about 200,000 cafes across france .
fifty years later , there are only around 40,000 left and , according to industry statistics , two cafes go out of business every day .
on a sunny day in paris , everything still appears normal .
at le grand palais , a cafe in paris 's swanky eighth district , the terraces are full with tourists sipping lemonade , office types having lunch , and people sitting quietly on their own , reading as they take in the warm weather .
across town at le belair in the belleville neighborhood of paris , though , there 's a much different scene .
just before lunch , there are only two customers at the bar .
it 's the kind of sparsely-decorated one-room cafe with a bar that can be found in working-class neighborhoods all around the country .
owner zahir idris says business is extremely slow these days .
" with the smoking ban and the way the police are cracking down on alcohol at the wheel , our sales have been halved , " he says .
" just look around .
before lunch there used to be people having cocktails .
now there is almost no one .
in the good days , we used to serve 40 or 50 lunches .
now we barely serve 10 lunches a day .
how can we make any money like that ? "
idris says he 's just barely able to stay open and that he 's often struggling to pay the bills .
the french government recently lowered the sales tax on all non-alcoholic products sold in cafes .
but idris says it wo n't make much difference to him as his sales are already so low .
his plight is repeated at cafes all around france .
traditional cafes and bars are struggling and many have to close .
the total number of french cafes is down five-fold since 1960 .
and it 's quite common to see boarded-up cafes that will never open again , especially in small towns .
owners need to move with the times bernard quartier , president of the national federation of cafes , brasseries and discotheques , does n't believe the trend is the result of new smoking or drink driving legislation .
he says cafe owners simply have n't been keeping up with the times .
" i think cafes are out of sync with society . " he says .
" they were in sync during the 1950s , but they are n't anymore .
a cafe has to be clean .
the coffee has to be good .
in many cases the coffee is n't good .
the beer has to be good .
and you have to be able to order non-alcoholic drinks , like fresh-squeezed orange juice or smoothies .
you have to be able to find a newspaper in a cafe , or find a television where sporting events are broadcast .
there has to be something to draw people . "
quartier also argues that service needs to improve ; customers want to be welcomed with a smile and use spotless restrooms .
he adds that cafe owners who offer customers what they want are doing well , but that those who 've kept the same tired furniture and focus almost exclusively on alcohol are in trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aside from good coffee , cafes need to offer customers a concept , quartier says quartier himself has owned eight different cafes , starting with the first one he bought at age 23 .
today , he 's visiting his newest venture : an italian-themed cafe in paris 's upscale seventh district .
the current owner is selling because the business is n't making enough money .
quartier says he plans to reduce prices and serve food and drink from his home region , the loire valley .
he also wants to organize art shows and literary evenings here to draw people .
his focus is n't just coffee .
he has a whole concept in mind .
additional threat from the internet while diversifying a cafe 's offerings may certainly be good advice , there appear to be other trends at work adding to the demise of cafe culture .
previous generations of cafe owners did n't have to compete with social networking sites such as facebook , twitter , or linked in , for example .
these sites give people the impression they 're socializing from the comfort of their own homes , making it unnecessary to venture out to a cafe .
christine pujol , the head of umih , an industry group that represents france 's cafes and restaurants , says the disappearance of cafe culture is worrying on a broader level .
" we often say that cafes are a part of france 's national heritage - from a social , cultural and even architectural perspective , " pujol says .
" it 's very saddening to think that these places could disappear and that they will stop playing the social role they have been playing for so long . "
the french writer honore de balzac once said that cafes are the parliament of the people .
this is still true to a certain extent .
political parties sometimes organize public gatherings in cafes and it 's the place to go when meeting up with someone far from home .
but if the current trend continues , there 's a risk france 's cafe culture could turn into something of a relic .
instead of finding one on almost every corner , as is the case today , they 'd be limited to tourist sites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 14.08.2009 germany 's far right becomes internet savvy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media-savyy right-wing extremists no longer use more obvious neo-nazi symbols the number of right-wing extremist websites in germany is rising , with a group charged with youth protection warning that the internet has become the leading platform for right-wing extremist propaganda . germany 's right-wing extremist scene is developing a professional , media-savvy internet presence , according to jugendschutz.de , an internet watch group for german youth .
with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

the nine-day meet in berlin features the world 's fastest man and several german medal hopefuls . the biggest name among the roughly 2,000 athletes scheduled to compete in the 12th international association of athletics federations -lrb- iaaf -rrb- world championships is jamaica 's usain bolt .
at last year 's olympic games in beijing , bolt was the star of the track and field events and earned the title of world 's fastest man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tyson gay is aiming to defend his 100-meter and 200-meter titles in beijing , bolt brought home three gold medals for the 100-meter dash , 200 meters , and the 4x100 relay .
all three races yielded world records , and bolt literally coasted across the finish line of the 100 meters in one of the games ' most memorable moments .
american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .
his showdown with bolt in the 100 on sunday night will be one of the highlights of the meet in berlin , and it comes exactly one year after bolt 's olympic victory in the 100 .
the two are to face each other again in the 200 on thursday evening .
field events best shot for germany although bolt will be one of the most recognizable figures at the meet , the home team at the world championships is well represented .
the german athletics team is coming off a disappointing performance at the olympics , only bringing home a single medal .
they 'll be hoping to return to the form they displayed at the 2007 world championships , where they captured seven medals , including two golds .
germany 's best chances for medals in berlin will be in the field events , and high jumper ariane friedrich is a heavy favorite .
she has already had good luck in berlin this year , as well .
at a golden league meet in the german capital in june , friedrich beat defending world champion blanka vlasic of croatia with a jump of 2.06 meters , breaking an 18-year-old german record .
bildunterschrift : ariane friedrich celebrates her german record jump at a meet in berlin in june friedrich , recognizable by her trademark pink knee-high stockings during the competition , says she is " hoping for a medal . "

she enters the competition in berlin ranked number one in the world in her event .
fellow javelin thrower steffi nerius will be in the medal hunt as well and is ranked fourth .

he had a breakthrough jump at the european indoor championships in march , winning with a mark of 8.71 meters .
he backed it up with an outdoor personal best 8.49 meters at the german championships , placing him fourth in the list of the best jumps in the world this year .
if he can put together another solid meet in berlin , he could have a shot at the podium .
other german medal hopefuls include betty heidler and kathrin klaas in the hammer throw , and nadine kleinart and denise hinrichs in the shot put .

irina mikitenko had been seen as one of the favorites for the women ’ s marathon , but she has withdrawn from the competition due to the recent death of her father .
sabrina mockenhaupt is still scheduled to toe the marathon starting line for germany , and is to focus exclusively on that race .
she had previously qualified for the 10,000-meters race , but has opted not to run it .

but with locals doing that less and less and the number of cafes dwindling at a rapid pace , is french cafe culture in danger of dying out ? in 1960 , there were about 200,000 cafes across france .
fifty years later , there are only around 40,000 left and , according to industry statistics , two cafes go out of business every day .
on a sunny day in paris , everything still appears normal .
at le grand palais , a cafe in paris 's swanky eighth district , the terraces are full with tourists sipping lemonade , office types having lunch , and people sitting quietly on their own , reading as they take in the warm weather .
across town at le belair in the belleville neighborhood of paris , though , there 's a much different scene .
just before lunch , there are only two customers at the bar .
it 's the kind of sparsely-decorated one-room cafe with a bar that can be found in working-class neighborhoods all around the country .
owner zahir idris says business is extremely slow these days .
" with the smoking ban and the way the police are cracking down on alcohol at the wheel , our sales have been halved , " he says .
" just look around .
before lunch there used to be people having cocktails .
now there is almost no one .
in the good days , we used to serve 40 or 50 lunches .
now we barely serve 10 lunches a day .
how can we make any money like that ? "
idris says he 's just barely able to stay open and that he 's often struggling to pay the bills .
the french government recently lowered the sales tax on all non-alcoholic products sold in cafes .
but idris says it wo n't make much difference to him as his sales are already so low .
his plight is repeated at cafes all around france .
traditional cafes and bars are struggling and many have to close .
the total number of french cafes is down five-fold since 1960 .
and it 's quite common to see boarded-up cafes that will never open again , especially in small towns .
owners need to move with the times bernard quartier , president of the national federation of cafes , brasseries and discotheques , does n't believe the trend is the result of new smoking or drink driving legislation .
he says cafe owners simply have n't been keeping up with the times .
" i think cafes are out of sync with society . " he says .
" they were in sync during the 1950s , but they are n't anymore .
a cafe has to be clean .
the coffee has to be good .
in many cases the coffee is n't good .
the beer has to be good .
and you have to be able to order non-alcoholic drinks , like fresh-squeezed orange juice or smoothies .
you have to be able to find a newspaper in a cafe , or find a television where sporting events are broadcast .
there has to be something to draw people . "
quartier also argues that service needs to improve ; customers want to be welcomed with a smile and use spotless restrooms .
he adds that cafe owners who offer customers what they want are doing well , but that those who 've kept the same tired furniture and focus almost exclusively on alcohol are in trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aside from good coffee , cafes need to offer customers a concept , quartier says quartier himself has owned eight different cafes , starting with the first one he bought at age 23 .
today , he 's visiting his newest venture : an italian-themed cafe in paris 's upscale seventh district .
the current owner is selling because the business is n't making enough money .
quartier says he plans to reduce prices and serve food and drink from his home region , the loire valley .
he also wants to organize art shows and literary evenings here to draw people .
his focus is n't just coffee .
he has a whole concept in mind .
additional threat from the internet while diversifying a cafe 's offerings may certainly be good advice , there appear to be other trends at work adding to the demise of cafe culture .
previous generations of cafe owners did n't have to compete with social networking sites such as facebook , twitter , or linked in , for example .
these sites give people the impression they 're socializing from the comfort of their own homes , making it unnecessary to venture out to a cafe .
christine pujol , the head of umih , an industry group that represents france 's cafes and restaurants , says the disappearance of cafe culture is worrying on a broader level .
" we often say that cafes are a part of france 's national heritage - from a social , cultural and even architectural perspective , " pujol says .

but with locals doing that less and less and the number of cafes dwindling at a rapid pace , is french cafe culture in danger of dying out ? in 1960 , there were about 200,000 cafes across france .
fifty years later , there are only around 40,000 left and , according to industry statistics , two cafes go out of business every day .
on a sunny day in paris , everything still appears normal .
at le grand palais , a cafe in paris 's swanky eighth district , the terraces are full with tourists sipping lemonade , office types having lunch , and people sitting quietly on their own , reading as they take in the warm weather .
across town at le belair in the belleville neighborhood of paris , though , there 's a much different scene .
just before lunch , there are only two customers at the bar .
it 's the kind of sparsely-decorated one-room cafe with a bar that can be found in working-class neighborhoods all around the country .
owner zahir idris says business is extremely slow these days .
" with the smoking ban and the way the police are cracking down on alcohol at the wheel , our sales have been halved , " he says .
" just look around .
before lunch there used to be people having cocktails .
now there is almost no one .
in the good days , we used to serve 40 or 50 lunches .
now we barely serve 10 lunches a day .
how can we make any money like that ? "
idris says he 's just barely able to stay open and that he 's often struggling to pay the bills .
the french government recently lowered the sales tax on all non-alcoholic products sold in cafes .
but idris says it wo n't make much difference to him as his sales are already so low .
his plight is repeated at cafes all around france .
traditional cafes and bars are struggling and many have to close .
the total number of french cafes is down five-fold since 1960 .
and it 's quite common to see boarded-up cafes that will never open again , especially in small towns .
owners need to move with the times bernard quartier , president of the national federation of cafes , brasseries and discotheques , does n't believe the trend is the result of new smoking or drink driving legislation .
he says cafe owners simply have n't been keeping up with the times .
" i think cafes are out of sync with society . " he says .
" they were in sync during the 1950s , but they are n't anymore .
a cafe has to be clean .
the coffee has to be good .
in many cases the coffee is n't good .
the beer has to be good .
and you have to be able to order non-alcoholic drinks , like fresh-squeezed orange juice or smoothies .
you have to be able to find a newspaper in a cafe , or find a television where sporting events are broadcast .
there has to be something to draw people . "
quartier also argues that service needs to improve ; customers want to be welcomed with a smile and use spotless restrooms .
he adds that cafe owners who offer customers what they want are doing well , but that those who 've kept the same tired furniture and focus almost exclusively on alcohol are in trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aside from good coffee , cafes need to offer customers a concept , quartier says quartier himself has owned eight different cafes , starting with the first one he bought at age 23 .
today , he 's visiting his newest venture : an italian-themed cafe in paris 's upscale seventh district .
the current owner is selling because the business is n't making enough money .
quartier says he plans to reduce prices and serve food and drink from his home region , the loire valley .
he also wants to organize art shows and literary evenings here to draw people .
his focus is n't just coffee .
he has a whole concept in mind .
additional threat from the internet while diversifying a cafe 's offerings may certainly be good advice , there appear to be other trends at work adding to the demise of cafe culture .
previous generations of cafe owners did n't have to compete with social networking sites such as facebook , twitter , or linked in , for example .
these sites give people the impression they 're socializing from the comfort of their own homes , making it unnecessary to venture out to a cafe .
christine pujol , the head of umih , an industry group that represents france 's cafes and restaurants , says the disappearance of cafe culture is worrying on a broader level .
" we often say that cafes are a part of france 's national heritage - from a social , cultural and even architectural perspective , " pujol says .
" it 's very saddening to think that these places could disappear and that they will stop playing the social role they have been playing for so long . "
the french writer honore de balzac once said that cafes are the parliament of the people .
this is still true to a certain extent .
political parties sometimes organize public gatherings in cafes and it 's the place to go when meeting up with someone far from home .
but if the current trend continues , there 's a risk france 's cafe culture could turn into something of a relic .
instead of finding one on almost every corner , as is the case today , they 'd be limited to tourist sites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.08.2009 climate change already visible on greenland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 85 percent of greenland is covered in ice many scientists and governments are talking about what will happen once climate change begins to occur , but on the great island of greenland global warming is n't just a future problem - it 's happening now . greenland is the largest island on the planet , and most of it - around 85 percent - is covered in ice .
at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .
i 'm afraid we will lose all of that stuff that makes up our identity . " author : irene quaile -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .

gavin blackburn has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.08.2009 threat to pakistani nuclear arsenal is real , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's military displays its ghauri missile , which can carry nuclear warheads pakistan 's nuclear weapons facilities were attacked three times in 2007 and 2008 by extremists , a recently published report says .
the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .

he 's the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor but most of all he is the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate to become the country 's next chancellor . if germans voters were to cast their ballots today , the spd would get a mere 22 percent - one percentage point less than in the previous week .

the green party would get 12 percent according to the poll while the left party would get 9 percent .
speaking during a stop on the campaign trail , steinmeier told reporters that he was not discouraged by the new figures .

but he stressed that if you know that if your policy is on the right track , " then you ca n't allow opinion polls to get you all too worried . "
steinmeier says he 's confident that the remaining six weeks are enough time to turn the voters favor in his direction .
but when it comes to direct comparison between foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier and chancellor merkel , the gap is even wider .

polls show support for the spd at a record low . it is only six weeks until germans head to the polls in a general election and prospects are as grim as they could be for frank-walter steinmeier .
he 's the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor but most of all he is the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate to become the country 's next chancellor . if germans voters were to cast their ballots today , the spd would get a mere 22 percent - one percentage point less than in the previous week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinion polls see the cdu and fdp on their way into the bundestag current polls see cdu and fdp ahead that is the worst result ever for the party the deutschlandtrend opinion polls commissioned for public broadcaster ard . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , combined with their sister party , the bavaria-based christian social union , would get a comfortable 37 percent - up two percent .
steinmeier 's spd is the junior partner in the grand coalition with the merkel 's christian democrats .
both parties have repeatedly said that they do n't want to continue in their uneasy grand coalition after the september 27 vote .
the opinion poll puts merkel on track to become chancellor of a right-of-center coalition .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , are on 15 percent support , which would give the cdu and fdp combined a majority of 52 percent .
the green party would get 12 percent according to the poll while the left party would get 9 percent .
speaking during a stop on the campaign trail , steinmeier told reporters that he was not discouraged by the new figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waving goodbye to steinmeier and the social democrats ?
enough time to turn things around ?
he said there were some opinion polls he liked and some that he did n't , but admitted that he was n't too happy about the recent ratings .
but he stressed that if you know that if your policy is on the right track , " then you ca n't allow opinion polls to get you all too worried . "
steinmeier says he 's confident that the remaining six weeks are enough time to turn the voters favor in his direction .
but when it comes to direct comparison between foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier and chancellor merkel , the gap is even wider .
merkel has a comfortable lead with 62 percent over steinmeier with 23 percent. ai / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .
now we are trying to preserve languages but not only through the european office for regional and minority languages but also the local organizations . do you speak any minority languages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramm represents germany 's minority languages in the eu i am a saterland frisian , but i ca n't speak the language very well .
it is very hard to speak .
i was n't born in the region , but have been living in the saterland for 30 years and have been able to learn quite a bit . can you give us an example of saterland frisian ? if you ask ' wie heißt du ? '
-lrb- what 's your name ? -rrb- it 's ' wo hats du ? ' in saterland frisian .

the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .

the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .
now we are trying to preserve languages but not only through the european office for regional and minority languages but also the local organizations . do you speak any minority languages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramm represents germany 's minority languages in the eu i am a saterland frisian , but i ca n't speak the language very well .
it is very hard to speak .
i was n't born in the region , but have been living in the saterland for 30 years and have been able to learn quite a bit . can you give us an example of saterland frisian ? if you ask ' wie heißt du ? '
-lrb- what 's your name ? -rrb- it 's ' wo hats du ? ' in saterland frisian .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.08.2009 poles , germans rebury 2,000 wwii victims found in mass grave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies from the mass grave were taken from malbork the remains of more than 2,000 german civilians discovered in a mass grave in the town of malbork in northern poland have been reburied at a ceremony at one of the country 's german military cemeteries on friday . the victims are believed to have been caught up in the russian army 's offensive in what was then the german province of east prussia in the final stages of world war ii ; a province split between poland and russia after the war .
the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .

the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.08.2009 poles , germans rebury 2,000 wwii victims found in mass grave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies from the mass grave were taken from malbork the remains of more than 2,000 german civilians discovered in a mass grave in the town of malbork in northern poland have been reburied at a ceremony at one of the country 's german military cemeteries on friday . the victims are believed to have been caught up in the russian army 's offensive in what was then the german province of east prussia in the final stages of world war ii ; a province split between poland and russia after the war .
the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .

" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .

but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 14.08.2009 germany 's far right becomes internet savvy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media-savyy right-wing extremists no longer use more obvious neo-nazi symbols the number of right-wing extremist websites in germany is rising , with a group charged with youth protection warning that the internet has become the leading platform for right-wing extremist propaganda . germany 's right-wing extremist scene is developing a professional , media-savvy internet presence , according to jugendschutz.de , an internet watch group for german youth .
with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

at last year 's olympic games in beijing , bolt was the star of the track and field events and earned the title of world 's fastest man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tyson gay is aiming to defend his 100-meter and 200-meter titles in beijing , bolt brought home three gold medals for the 100-meter dash , 200 meters , and the 4x100 relay .
all three races yielded world records , and bolt literally coasted across the finish line of the 100 meters in one of the games ' most memorable moments .
american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .
his showdown with bolt in the 100 on sunday night will be one of the highlights of the meet in berlin , and it comes exactly one year after bolt 's olympic victory in the 100 .
the two are to face each other again in the 200 on thursday evening .
field events best shot for germany although bolt will be one of the most recognizable figures at the meet , the home team at the world championships is well represented .
the german athletics team is coming off a disappointing performance at the olympics , only bringing home a single medal .
they 'll be hoping to return to the form they displayed at the 2007 world championships , where they captured seven medals , including two golds .
germany 's best chances for medals in berlin will be in the field events , and high jumper ariane friedrich is a heavy favorite .
she has already had good luck in berlin this year , as well .
at a golden league meet in the german capital in june , friedrich beat defending world champion blanka vlasic of croatia with a jump of 2.06 meters , breaking an 18-year-old german record .
bildunterschrift : ariane friedrich celebrates her german record jump at a meet in berlin in june friedrich , recognizable by her trademark pink knee-high stockings during the competition , says she is " hoping for a medal . "
lone olympic medalist returns the bright spot on germany 's olympic team in beijing was javelin thrower christina obergfoell , who took home the bronze .
she enters the competition in berlin ranked number one in the world in her event .
fellow javelin thrower steffi nerius will be in the medal hunt as well and is ranked fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina obergfoell 's bronze in the javelin was germany 's only olympic medal in beijing long jumper sebastian bayer has been a surprise success this season for the german team .
he had a breakthrough jump at the european indoor championships in march , winning with a mark of 8.71 meters .
he backed it up with an outdoor personal best 8.49 meters at the german championships , placing him fourth in the list of the best jumps in the world this year .
if he can put together another solid meet in berlin , he could have a shot at the podium .
other german medal hopefuls include betty heidler and kathrin klaas in the hammer throw , and nadine kleinart and denise hinrichs in the shot put .
late withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikitenko -lrb- left -rrb- was eying gold , but now mockenhaupt is german favorite while the germans should stack up well against the competition in the field events , things do n't look as good when it comes to the track .
irina mikitenko had been seen as one of the favorites for the women ’ s marathon , but she has withdrawn from the competition due to the recent death of her father .
sabrina mockenhaupt is still scheduled to toe the marathon starting line for germany , and is to focus exclusively on that race .
she had previously qualified for the 10,000-meters race , but has opted not to run it .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .

in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 14.08.2009 germany 's far right becomes internet savvy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media-savyy right-wing extremists no longer use more obvious neo-nazi symbols the number of right-wing extremist websites in germany is rising , with a group charged with youth protection warning that the internet has become the leading platform for right-wing extremist propaganda . germany 's right-wing extremist scene is developing a professional , media-savvy internet presence , according to jugendschutz.de , an internet watch group for german youth .
with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 14.08.2009 the bermuda triangle of the north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic sea has been missing for more than two weeks a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .

jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .

the three were convicted of insurance fraud to raise funds for supporting the terrorist network . germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe on friday confirmed two of the men 's sentences of six and seven years .
it said the third man 's sentence should be reassessed .
the defendants had appealed their 2007 conviction , arguing that the police had breached privacy laws when they bugged the men 's homes .
the principal defendant , 32-year-old syrian-national ibrahim mohamed k. , had been sentenced to seven years imprisonment for membership in a terrorist organization and attempted fraud in 28 cases .
yasser abu s. , a palestinian , received a six-year sentence for the same crimes .
his brother , ismail abu s. , was sentenced to three and a half years in jail for attempted fraud .
the court said it had only been proven that ismail abu s. had supported a terrorist organization , not that he had also been a member , and it referred his case back to a lower court for his sentence to be revised .
the men had attempted to raise at least 4.3 million euros -lrb- $ 6.1 million -rrb- for the al-qaeda terrorist network in a massive life insurance scam .
part of the evidence in the trial was acquired by bugging the men 's homes .
though eavesdropping laws were later tightened , the court did admit the evidence gathered was from wire-tapping . ai / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .

he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .

disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .

neither measure was adopted .

" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .

"
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.08.2009 poles , germans rebury 2,000 wwii victims found in mass grave großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies from the mass grave were taken from malbork the remains of more than 2,000 german civilians discovered in a mass grave in the town of malbork in northern poland have been reburied at a ceremony at one of the country 's german military cemeteries on friday . the victims are believed to have been caught up in the russian army 's offensive in what was then the german province of east prussia in the final stages of world war ii ; a province split between poland and russia after the war .
the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .

medvedev praised merkel for her crisis management skills and referred to signs that the german economy could be pulling out of the recession .
germany is russia 's biggest trading partner in europe , with bilateral trade between the two countries rising to a record 47.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.2 billion -rrb- in 2008 .
medvedev said he was eager to find joint solutions with germany to the economic crisis .
the crisis , he added , was a " chance to deepen their economic ties . "
the two also discussed the planned russian investments in the wadan shipyards in mecklenburg-western pomerania as well as the role of the state-owned russian lender sberbank and automaker gaz in the rescue of general motors ' german subsidiary opel .
merkel said discussions regarding opel 's future had now reached a decisive stage .
she hoped for a decision " as soon as possible . "
she added that austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid , with its russian partner sberbank , is favored by her coalition government .
opel employs around 25,000 germans .
merkel also reaffirmed germany 's support for russia 's pipeline project in the baltic sea .
chechnya killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies of zarema sadulayeva and her husband were found tuesday though trade issues were the focus of the talks , merkel did express her concern about the recent spate of murders in the russian caucasus during her two-hour meeting with medvedev .
" we spoke about the sad news concerning the murder of representatives of non-government organizations in chechnya , " said merkel at a news conference after the talks .
" i made clear that we obviously condemn this in the strongest terms , just like the russian side , " she added .
the bodies of children 's charity chief zarema sadulayeva and her husband were found in grozny on tuesday , while in july prominent human rights activist natalya estemirova was found dead on a roadside hours after her abduction in grozny .
medvedev acknowledged germany 's concerns but reiterated that it was his and the chechen leadership 's responsibility to solve such crimes and punish the perpetrators .
" the president of the chechen republic -lsb- ramzan kadyrov -rsb- should do everything he can to find and expose those responsible , " medvedev told journalists , adding that the murders were aimed at undermining stability in the region .
on the diplomatic front , medvedev said the two leaders had discussed difficult problems like iran 's nuclear program , north korea and the situation in afghanistan .
medvedev said afghanistan was a good example of the close cooperation between germany , europe and the united states. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .

since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .

medvedev praised merkel for her crisis management skills and referred to signs that the german economy could be pulling out of the recession .
germany is russia 's biggest trading partner in europe , with bilateral trade between the two countries rising to a record 47.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.2 billion -rrb- in 2008 .
medvedev said he was eager to find joint solutions with germany to the economic crisis .
the crisis , he added , was a " chance to deepen their economic ties . "
the two also discussed the planned russian investments in the wadan shipyards in mecklenburg-western pomerania as well as the role of the state-owned russian lender sberbank and automaker gaz in the rescue of general motors ' german subsidiary opel .
merkel said discussions regarding opel 's future had now reached a decisive stage .
she hoped for a decision " as soon as possible . "
she added that austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid , with its russian partner sberbank , is favored by her coalition government .
opel employs around 25,000 germans .
merkel also reaffirmed germany 's support for russia 's pipeline project in the baltic sea .
chechnya killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies of zarema sadulayeva and her husband were found tuesday though trade issues were the focus of the talks , merkel did express her concern about the recent spate of murders in the russian caucasus during her two-hour meeting with medvedev .
" we spoke about the sad news concerning the murder of representatives of non-government organizations in chechnya , " said merkel at a news conference after the talks .
" i made clear that we obviously condemn this in the strongest terms , just like the russian side , " she added .
the bodies of children 's charity chief zarema sadulayeva and her husband were found in grozny on tuesday , while in july prominent human rights activist natalya estemirova was found dead on a roadside hours after her abduction in grozny .
medvedev acknowledged germany 's concerns but reiterated that it was his and the chechen leadership 's responsibility to solve such crimes and punish the perpetrators .
" the president of the chechen republic -lsb- ramzan kadyrov -rsb- should do everything he can to find and expose those responsible , " medvedev told journalists , adding that the murders were aimed at undermining stability in the region .
on the diplomatic front , medvedev said the two leaders had discussed difficult problems like iran 's nuclear program , north korea and the situation in afghanistan .
medvedev said afghanistan was a good example of the close cooperation between germany , europe and the united states. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.08.2009 threat to pakistani nuclear arsenal is real , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's military displays its ghauri missile , which can carry nuclear warheads pakistan 's nuclear weapons facilities were attacked three times in 2007 and 2008 by extremists , a recently published report says .
the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .

and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.08.2009 climate change already visible on greenland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 85 percent of greenland is covered in ice many scientists and governments are talking about what will happen once climate change begins to occur , but on the great island of greenland global warming is n't just a future problem - it 's happening now . greenland is the largest island on the planet , and most of it - around 85 percent - is covered in ice .
at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.08.2009 threat to pakistani nuclear arsenal is real , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's military displays its ghauri missile , which can carry nuclear warheads pakistan 's nuclear weapons facilities were attacked three times in 2007 and 2008 by extremists , a recently published report says .
the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.08.2009 european banks weather credit card defaults better than us counterparts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' shop til you drop ' may soon be an outdated philosophy the global financial crisis began when the real estate bubble burst in the united states last year .
although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 14.08.2009 the bermuda triangle of the north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic sea has been missing for more than two weeks a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .

the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .

american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .
his showdown with bolt in the 100 on sunday night will be one of the highlights of the meet in berlin , and it comes exactly one year after bolt 's olympic victory in the 100 .
the two are to face each other again in the 200 on thursday evening .
field events best shot for germany although bolt will be one of the most recognizable figures at the meet , the home team at the world championships is well represented .
the german athletics team is coming off a disappointing performance at the olympics , only bringing home a single medal .
they 'll be hoping to return to the form they displayed at the 2007 world championships , where they captured seven medals , including two golds .
germany 's best chances for medals in berlin will be in the field events , and high jumper ariane friedrich is a heavy favorite .
she has already had good luck in berlin this year , as well .
at a golden league meet in the german capital in june , friedrich beat defending world champion blanka vlasic of croatia with a jump of 2.06 meters , breaking an 18-year-old german record .

she enters the competition in berlin ranked number one in the world in her event .
fellow javelin thrower steffi nerius will be in the medal hunt as well and is ranked fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina obergfoell 's bronze in the javelin was germany 's only olympic medal in beijing long jumper sebastian bayer has been a surprise success this season for the german team .
he had a breakthrough jump at the european indoor championships in march , winning with a mark of 8.71 meters .
he backed it up with an outdoor personal best 8.49 meters at the german championships , placing him fourth in the list of the best jumps in the world this year .
if he can put together another solid meet in berlin , he could have a shot at the podium .
other german medal hopefuls include betty heidler and kathrin klaas in the hammer throw , and nadine kleinart and denise hinrichs in the shot put .
late withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikitenko -lrb- left -rrb- was eying gold , but now mockenhaupt is german favorite while the germans should stack up well against the competition in the field events , things do n't look as good when it comes to the track .
irina mikitenko had been seen as one of the favorites for the women ’ s marathon , but she has withdrawn from the competition due to the recent death of her father .
sabrina mockenhaupt is still scheduled to toe the marathon starting line for germany , and is to focus exclusively on that race .
she had previously qualified for the 10,000-meters race , but has opted not to run it .

but with locals doing that less and less and the number of cafes dwindling at a rapid pace , is french cafe culture in danger of dying out ? in 1960 , there were about 200,000 cafes across france .
fifty years later , there are only around 40,000 left and , according to industry statistics , two cafes go out of business every day .
on a sunny day in paris , everything still appears normal .
at le grand palais , a cafe in paris 's swanky eighth district , the terraces are full with tourists sipping lemonade , office types having lunch , and people sitting quietly on their own , reading as they take in the warm weather .
across town at le belair in the belleville neighborhood of paris , though , there 's a much different scene .
just before lunch , there are only two customers at the bar .
it 's the kind of sparsely-decorated one-room cafe with a bar that can be found in working-class neighborhoods all around the country .
owner zahir idris says business is extremely slow these days .
" with the smoking ban and the way the police are cracking down on alcohol at the wheel , our sales have been halved , " he says .
" just look around .
before lunch there used to be people having cocktails .
now there is almost no one .
in the good days , we used to serve 40 or 50 lunches .
now we barely serve 10 lunches a day .
how can we make any money like that ? "
idris says he 's just barely able to stay open and that he 's often struggling to pay the bills .
the french government recently lowered the sales tax on all non-alcoholic products sold in cafes .
but idris says it wo n't make much difference to him as his sales are already so low .
his plight is repeated at cafes all around france .
traditional cafes and bars are struggling and many have to close .
the total number of french cafes is down five-fold since 1960 .
and it 's quite common to see boarded-up cafes that will never open again , especially in small towns .
owners need to move with the times bernard quartier , president of the national federation of cafes , brasseries and discotheques , does n't believe the trend is the result of new smoking or drink driving legislation .
he says cafe owners simply have n't been keeping up with the times .
" i think cafes are out of sync with society . " he says .
" they were in sync during the 1950s , but they are n't anymore .
a cafe has to be clean .
the coffee has to be good .
in many cases the coffee is n't good .
the beer has to be good .
and you have to be able to order non-alcoholic drinks , like fresh-squeezed orange juice or smoothies .
you have to be able to find a newspaper in a cafe , or find a television where sporting events are broadcast .
there has to be something to draw people . "
quartier also argues that service needs to improve ; customers want to be welcomed with a smile and use spotless restrooms .
he adds that cafe owners who offer customers what they want are doing well , but that those who 've kept the same tired furniture and focus almost exclusively on alcohol are in trouble .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aside from good coffee , cafes need to offer customers a concept , quartier says quartier himself has owned eight different cafes , starting with the first one he bought at age 23 .
today , he 's visiting his newest venture : an italian-themed cafe in paris 's upscale seventh district .
the current owner is selling because the business is n't making enough money .
quartier says he plans to reduce prices and serve food and drink from his home region , the loire valley .
he also wants to organize art shows and literary evenings here to draw people .
his focus is n't just coffee .
he has a whole concept in mind .
additional threat from the internet while diversifying a cafe 's offerings may certainly be good advice , there appear to be other trends at work adding to the demise of cafe culture .
previous generations of cafe owners did n't have to compete with social networking sites such as facebook , twitter , or linked in , for example .
these sites give people the impression they 're socializing from the comfort of their own homes , making it unnecessary to venture out to a cafe .
christine pujol , the head of umih , an industry group that represents france 's cafes and restaurants , says the disappearance of cafe culture is worrying on a broader level .
" we often say that cafes are a part of france 's national heritage - from a social , cultural and even architectural perspective , " pujol says .
" it 's very saddening to think that these places could disappear and that they will stop playing the social role they have been playing for so long . "
the french writer honore de balzac once said that cafes are the parliament of the people .
this is still true to a certain extent .
political parties sometimes organize public gatherings in cafes and it 's the place to go when meeting up with someone far from home .
but if the current trend continues , there 's a risk france 's cafe culture could turn into something of a relic .
instead of finding one on almost every corner , as is the case today , they 'd be limited to tourist sites .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .
combat 18 is the armed wing of the british neo-nazi organization blood & honour , which has carried out violent racist attacks on immigrants in the uk , belgium , russia and germany. nrt / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polls show support for the spd at a record low . it is only six weeks until germans head to the polls in a general election and prospects are as grim as they could be for frank-walter steinmeier .
he 's the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor but most of all he is the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate to become the country 's next chancellor . if germans voters were to cast their ballots today , the spd would get a mere 22 percent - one percentage point less than in the previous week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinion polls see the cdu and fdp on their way into the bundestag current polls see cdu and fdp ahead that is the worst result ever for the party the deutschlandtrend opinion polls commissioned for public broadcaster ard . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , combined with their sister party , the bavaria-based christian social union , would get a comfortable 37 percent - up two percent .
steinmeier 's spd is the junior partner in the grand coalition with the merkel 's christian democrats .
both parties have repeatedly said that they do n't want to continue in their uneasy grand coalition after the september 27 vote .
the opinion poll puts merkel on track to become chancellor of a right-of-center coalition .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , are on 15 percent support , which would give the cdu and fdp combined a majority of 52 percent .
the green party would get 12 percent according to the poll while the left party would get 9 percent .
speaking during a stop on the campaign trail , steinmeier told reporters that he was not discouraged by the new figures .

he said there were some opinion polls he liked and some that he did n't , but admitted that he was n't too happy about the recent ratings .
but he stressed that if you know that if your policy is on the right track , " then you ca n't allow opinion polls to get you all too worried . "
steinmeier says he 's confident that the remaining six weeks are enough time to turn the voters favor in his direction .
but when it comes to direct comparison between foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier and chancellor merkel , the gap is even wider .

polls show support for the spd at a record low . it is only six weeks until germans head to the polls in a general election and prospects are as grim as they could be for frank-walter steinmeier .
he 's the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor but most of all he is the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate to become the country 's next chancellor . if germans voters were to cast their ballots today , the spd would get a mere 22 percent - one percentage point less than in the previous week .

steinmeier 's spd is the junior partner in the grand coalition with the merkel 's christian democrats .
both parties have repeatedly said that they do n't want to continue in their uneasy grand coalition after the september 27 vote .
the opinion poll puts merkel on track to become chancellor of a right-of-center coalition .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , are on 15 percent support , which would give the cdu and fdp combined a majority of 52 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.08.2009 european banks weather credit card defaults better than us counterparts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' shop til you drop ' may soon be an outdated philosophy the global financial crisis began when the real estate bubble burst in the united states last year .
although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.08.2009 unique european languages disappear silently großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some minority languages fade away without anyone noticing there are 23 official languages in the european union and numerous regional languages and dialects .
the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .
now we are trying to preserve languages but not only through the european office for regional and minority languages but also the local organizations . do you speak any minority languages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramm represents germany 's minority languages in the eu i am a saterland frisian , but i ca n't speak the language very well .
it is very hard to speak .
i was n't born in the region , but have been living in the saterland for 30 years and have been able to learn quite a bit . can you give us an example of saterland frisian ? if you ask ' wie heißt du ? '
-lrb- what 's your name ? -rrb- it 's ' wo hats du ? ' in saterland frisian .
and the answer is ' ick hete karl , ' instead of ' ich heiße karl ' -lrb- my name is karl -rrb- in german . interview : silke wuensch -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

medvedev praised merkel for her crisis management skills and referred to signs that the german economy could be pulling out of the recession .
germany is russia 's biggest trading partner in europe , with bilateral trade between the two countries rising to a record 47.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.2 billion -rrb- in 2008 .
medvedev said he was eager to find joint solutions with germany to the economic crisis .
the crisis , he added , was a " chance to deepen their economic ties . "
the two also discussed the planned russian investments in the wadan shipyards in mecklenburg-western pomerania as well as the role of the state-owned russian lender sberbank and automaker gaz in the rescue of general motors ' german subsidiary opel .
merkel said discussions regarding opel 's future had now reached a decisive stage .
she hoped for a decision " as soon as possible . "
she added that austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid , with its russian partner sberbank , is favored by her coalition government .
opel employs around 25,000 germans .
merkel also reaffirmed germany 's support for russia 's pipeline project in the baltic sea .
chechnya killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bodies of zarema sadulayeva and her husband were found tuesday though trade issues were the focus of the talks , merkel did express her concern about the recent spate of murders in the russian caucasus during her two-hour meeting with medvedev .
" we spoke about the sad news concerning the murder of representatives of non-government organizations in chechnya , " said merkel at a news conference after the talks .
" i made clear that we obviously condemn this in the strongest terms , just like the russian side , " she added .
the bodies of children 's charity chief zarema sadulayeva and her husband were found in grozny on tuesday , while in july prominent human rights activist natalya estemirova was found dead on a roadside hours after her abduction in grozny .
medvedev acknowledged germany 's concerns but reiterated that it was his and the chechen leadership 's responsibility to solve such crimes and punish the perpetrators .
" the president of the chechen republic -lsb- ramzan kadyrov -rsb- should do everything he can to find and expose those responsible , " medvedev told journalists , adding that the murders were aimed at undermining stability in the region .
on the diplomatic front , medvedev said the two leaders had discussed difficult problems like iran 's nuclear program , north korea and the situation in afghanistan .
medvedev said afghanistan was a good example of the close cooperation between germany , europe and the united states. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .

shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .

krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.08.2009 climate change already visible on greenland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 85 percent of greenland is covered in ice many scientists and governments are talking about what will happen once climate change begins to occur , but on the great island of greenland global warming is n't just a future problem - it 's happening now . greenland is the largest island on the planet , and most of it - around 85 percent - is covered in ice .
at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .
i 'm afraid we will lose all of that stuff that makes up our identity . " author : irene quaile -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .
i 'm afraid we will lose all of that stuff that makes up our identity . " author : irene quaile -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nine-day meet in berlin features the world 's fastest man and several german medal hopefuls . the biggest name among the roughly 2,000 athletes scheduled to compete in the 12th international association of athletics federations -lrb- iaaf -rrb- world championships is jamaica 's usain bolt .
at last year 's olympic games in beijing , bolt was the star of the track and field events and earned the title of world 's fastest man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tyson gay is aiming to defend his 100-meter and 200-meter titles in beijing , bolt brought home three gold medals for the 100-meter dash , 200 meters , and the 4x100 relay .
all three races yielded world records , and bolt literally coasted across the finish line of the 100 meters in one of the games ' most memorable moments .
american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .
his showdown with bolt in the 100 on sunday night will be one of the highlights of the meet in berlin , and it comes exactly one year after bolt 's olympic victory in the 100 .
the two are to face each other again in the 200 on thursday evening .
field events best shot for germany although bolt will be one of the most recognizable figures at the meet , the home team at the world championships is well represented .
the german athletics team is coming off a disappointing performance at the olympics , only bringing home a single medal .
they 'll be hoping to return to the form they displayed at the 2007 world championships , where they captured seven medals , including two golds .
germany 's best chances for medals in berlin will be in the field events , and high jumper ariane friedrich is a heavy favorite .
she has already had good luck in berlin this year , as well .
at a golden league meet in the german capital in june , friedrich beat defending world champion blanka vlasic of croatia with a jump of 2.06 meters , breaking an 18-year-old german record .
bildunterschrift : ariane friedrich celebrates her german record jump at a meet in berlin in june friedrich , recognizable by her trademark pink knee-high stockings during the competition , says she is " hoping for a medal . "

she enters the competition in berlin ranked number one in the world in her event .
fellow javelin thrower steffi nerius will be in the medal hunt as well and is ranked fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina obergfoell 's bronze in the javelin was germany 's only olympic medal in beijing long jumper sebastian bayer has been a surprise success this season for the german team .
he had a breakthrough jump at the european indoor championships in march , winning with a mark of 8.71 meters .
he backed it up with an outdoor personal best 8.49 meters at the german championships , placing him fourth in the list of the best jumps in the world this year .
if he can put together another solid meet in berlin , he could have a shot at the podium .
other german medal hopefuls include betty heidler and kathrin klaas in the hammer throw , and nadine kleinart and denise hinrichs in the shot put .

irina mikitenko had been seen as one of the favorites for the women ’ s marathon , but she has withdrawn from the competition due to the recent death of her father .
sabrina mockenhaupt is still scheduled to toe the marathon starting line for germany , and is to focus exclusively on that race .
she had previously qualified for the 10,000-meters race , but has opted not to run it .

he 's the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor but most of all he is the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate to become the country 's next chancellor . if germans voters were to cast their ballots today , the spd would get a mere 22 percent - one percentage point less than in the previous week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinion polls see the cdu and fdp on their way into the bundestag current polls see cdu and fdp ahead that is the worst result ever for the party the deutschlandtrend opinion polls commissioned for public broadcaster ard . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , combined with their sister party , the bavaria-based christian social union , would get a comfortable 37 percent - up two percent .
steinmeier 's spd is the junior partner in the grand coalition with the merkel 's christian democrats .
both parties have repeatedly said that they do n't want to continue in their uneasy grand coalition after the september 27 vote .
the opinion poll puts merkel on track to become chancellor of a right-of-center coalition .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , are on 15 percent support , which would give the cdu and fdp combined a majority of 52 percent .
the green party would get 12 percent according to the poll while the left party would get 9 percent .
speaking during a stop on the campaign trail , steinmeier told reporters that he was not discouraged by the new figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waving goodbye to steinmeier and the social democrats ?
enough time to turn things around ?
he said there were some opinion polls he liked and some that he did n't , but admitted that he was n't too happy about the recent ratings .
but he stressed that if you know that if your policy is on the right track , " then you ca n't allow opinion polls to get you all too worried . "
steinmeier says he 's confident that the remaining six weeks are enough time to turn the voters favor in his direction .
but when it comes to direct comparison between foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier and chancellor merkel , the gap is even wider .
merkel has a comfortable lead with 62 percent over steinmeier with 23 percent. ai / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gavin blackburn has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "

and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .

" probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .
combat 18 is the armed wing of the british neo-nazi organization blood & honour , which has carried out violent racist attacks on immigrants in the uk , belgium , russia and germany. nrt / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .
now we are trying to preserve languages but not only through the european office for regional and minority languages but also the local organizations . do you speak any minority languages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramm represents germany 's minority languages in the eu i am a saterland frisian , but i ca n't speak the language very well .
it is very hard to speak .

the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .

although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.08.2009 silly , sarcastic and subversive , die partei is hardly politics as usual großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei is doing its best to fight voter apathy shaking up german politics ahead of september 's election is die partei , a satirical party that , in addition to promising free sunbeds for all , wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
neale lytollis in berlin has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.08.2009 silly , sarcastic and subversive , die partei is hardly politics as usual großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei is doing its best to fight voter apathy shaking up german politics ahead of september 's election is die partei , a satirical party that , in addition to promising free sunbeds for all , wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
neale lytollis in berlin has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .
i 'm afraid we will lose all of that stuff that makes up our identity . " author : irene quaile -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .

neale lytollis in berlin has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .
i 'm afraid we will lose all of that stuff that makes up our identity . " author : irene quaile -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .

jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .

medvedev praised merkel for her crisis management skills and referred to signs that the german economy could be pulling out of the recession .
germany is russia 's biggest trading partner in europe , with bilateral trade between the two countries rising to a record 47.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.2 billion -rrb- in 2008 .
medvedev said he was eager to find joint solutions with germany to the economic crisis .
the crisis , he added , was a " chance to deepen their economic ties . "
the two also discussed the planned russian investments in the wadan shipyards in mecklenburg-western pomerania as well as the role of the state-owned russian lender sberbank and automaker gaz in the rescue of general motors ' german subsidiary opel .
merkel said discussions regarding opel 's future had now reached a decisive stage .
she hoped for a decision " as soon as possible . "
she added that austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid , with its russian partner sberbank , is favored by her coalition government .
opel employs around 25,000 germans .
merkel also reaffirmed germany 's support for russia 's pipeline project in the baltic sea .

" we spoke about the sad news concerning the murder of representatives of non-government organizations in chechnya , " said merkel at a news conference after the talks .
" i made clear that we obviously condemn this in the strongest terms , just like the russian side , " she added .
the bodies of children 's charity chief zarema sadulayeva and her husband were found in grozny on tuesday , while in july prominent human rights activist natalya estemirova was found dead on a roadside hours after her abduction in grozny .
medvedev acknowledged germany 's concerns but reiterated that it was his and the chechen leadership 's responsibility to solve such crimes and punish the perpetrators .
" the president of the chechen republic -lsb- ramzan kadyrov -rsb- should do everything he can to find and expose those responsible , " medvedev told journalists , adding that the murders were aimed at undermining stability in the region .
on the diplomatic front , medvedev said the two leaders had discussed difficult problems like iran 's nuclear program , north korea and the situation in afghanistan .
medvedev said afghanistan was a good example of the close cooperation between germany , europe and the united states. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .

qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .

the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.08.2009 gulf state of qatar to acquire large stake in porsche großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state-backed qatar investment fund is to take a voting stake in porsche the gulf state of qatar has agreed to buy a large stake in porsche , in a move intended to give volkswagen the chance of integrating the german luxury car maker into the vw group . qatar prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jaber al thani signed the agreement in stuttgart just 24 hours after vw sealed a deal to merge with porsche .
under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "

and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban operate from both pakistan and afghanistan to effectively safeguard pakistan 's nuclear arms cache , the west needs to devise a strategy to stabilize the country on a whole .
and in order to do that , argues hippler , western countries need to reevaluate their priorities in the region .
" if we think pakistan is more important than afghanistan , which it definitely is because of nuclear weapons , because of 170 million people , because of millions of pakistani migrants in britain and canada and elsewhere , then that has to have some repercussions for our afghan strategy and for our stabilizing strategy for pakistan .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

neale lytollis in berlin has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.08.2009 climate change already visible on greenland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 85 percent of greenland is covered in ice many scientists and governments are talking about what will happen once climate change begins to occur , but on the great island of greenland global warming is n't just a future problem - it 's happening now . greenland is the largest island on the planet , and most of it - around 85 percent - is covered in ice .
at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .
i 'm afraid we will lose all of that stuff that makes up our identity . " author : irene quaile -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polls show support for the spd at a record low . it is only six weeks until germans head to the polls in a general election and prospects are as grim as they could be for frank-walter steinmeier .
he 's the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor but most of all he is the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate to become the country 's next chancellor . if germans voters were to cast their ballots today , the spd would get a mere 22 percent - one percentage point less than in the previous week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinion polls see the cdu and fdp on their way into the bundestag current polls see cdu and fdp ahead that is the worst result ever for the party the deutschlandtrend opinion polls commissioned for public broadcaster ard . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , combined with their sister party , the bavaria-based christian social union , would get a comfortable 37 percent - up two percent .
steinmeier 's spd is the junior partner in the grand coalition with the merkel 's christian democrats .
both parties have repeatedly said that they do n't want to continue in their uneasy grand coalition after the september 27 vote .
the opinion poll puts merkel on track to become chancellor of a right-of-center coalition .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , are on 15 percent support , which would give the cdu and fdp combined a majority of 52 percent .
the green party would get 12 percent according to the poll while the left party would get 9 percent .
speaking during a stop on the campaign trail , steinmeier told reporters that he was not discouraged by the new figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waving goodbye to steinmeier and the social democrats ?
enough time to turn things around ?
he said there were some opinion polls he liked and some that he did n't , but admitted that he was n't too happy about the recent ratings .
but he stressed that if you know that if your policy is on the right track , " then you ca n't allow opinion polls to get you all too worried . "
steinmeier says he 's confident that the remaining six weeks are enough time to turn the voters favor in his direction .
but when it comes to direct comparison between foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier and chancellor merkel , the gap is even wider .
merkel has a comfortable lead with 62 percent over steinmeier with 23 percent. ai / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .
now we are trying to preserve languages but not only through the european office for regional and minority languages but also the local organizations . do you speak any minority languages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramm represents germany 's minority languages in the eu i am a saterland frisian , but i ca n't speak the language very well .

the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .
now we are trying to preserve languages but not only through the european office for regional and minority languages but also the local organizations . do you speak any minority languages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramm represents germany 's minority languages in the eu i am a saterland frisian , but i ca n't speak the language very well .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the nine-day meet in berlin features the world 's fastest man and several german medal hopefuls . the biggest name among the roughly 2,000 athletes scheduled to compete in the 12th international association of athletics federations -lrb- iaaf -rrb- world championships is jamaica 's usain bolt .
at last year 's olympic games in beijing , bolt was the star of the track and field events and earned the title of world 's fastest man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tyson gay is aiming to defend his 100-meter and 200-meter titles in beijing , bolt brought home three gold medals for the 100-meter dash , 200 meters , and the 4x100 relay .
all three races yielded world records , and bolt literally coasted across the finish line of the 100 meters in one of the games ' most memorable moments .
american tyson gay was absent from the finals of the 100 in beijing due to an injury but is set to run against bolt on the second day of the world championships .
gay is the defending world champion in the 100 and 200 from 2007 in osaka , japan .
his showdown with bolt in the 100 on sunday night will be one of the highlights of the meet in berlin , and it comes exactly one year after bolt 's olympic victory in the 100 .
the two are to face each other again in the 200 on thursday evening .
field events best shot for germany although bolt will be one of the most recognizable figures at the meet , the home team at the world championships is well represented .
the german athletics team is coming off a disappointing performance at the olympics , only bringing home a single medal .
they 'll be hoping to return to the form they displayed at the 2007 world championships , where they captured seven medals , including two golds .
germany 's best chances for medals in berlin will be in the field events , and high jumper ariane friedrich is a heavy favorite .
she has already had good luck in berlin this year , as well .
at a golden league meet in the german capital in june , friedrich beat defending world champion blanka vlasic of croatia with a jump of 2.06 meters , breaking an 18-year-old german record .

she enters the competition in berlin ranked number one in the world in her event .
fellow javelin thrower steffi nerius will be in the medal hunt as well and is ranked fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina obergfoell 's bronze in the javelin was germany 's only olympic medal in beijing long jumper sebastian bayer has been a surprise success this season for the german team .
he had a breakthrough jump at the european indoor championships in march , winning with a mark of 8.71 meters .
he backed it up with an outdoor personal best 8.49 meters at the german championships , placing him fourth in the list of the best jumps in the world this year .
if he can put together another solid meet in berlin , he could have a shot at the podium .
other german medal hopefuls include betty heidler and kathrin klaas in the hammer throw , and nadine kleinart and denise hinrichs in the shot put .
late withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikitenko -lrb- left -rrb- was eying gold , but now mockenhaupt is german favorite while the germans should stack up well against the competition in the field events , things do n't look as good when it comes to the track .
irina mikitenko had been seen as one of the favorites for the women ’ s marathon , but she has withdrawn from the competition due to the recent death of her father .
sabrina mockenhaupt is still scheduled to toe the marathon starting line for germany , and is to focus exclusively on that race .
she had previously qualified for the 10,000-meters race , but has opted not to run it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 14.08.2009 the bermuda triangle of the north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic sea has been missing for more than two weeks a german paper reported a sighting of the freighter which appeared to have sailed into a void .
but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .

although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 14.08.2009 germany 's far right becomes internet savvy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media-savyy right-wing extremists no longer use more obvious neo-nazi symbols the number of right-wing extremist websites in germany is rising , with a group charged with youth protection warning that the internet has become the leading platform for right-wing extremist propaganda . germany 's right-wing extremist scene is developing a professional , media-savvy internet presence , according to jugendschutz.de , an internet watch group for german youth .
with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .

we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .

the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .
if the merger goes through as planned , porsche would become vw 's seventh brand , joining other premium brands like bentley , bugatti , lamborghini and audi as well mass-market models such as volkswagen and skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche -lrb- r . -rrb- and piech -lrb- l . -rrb- need a cash injection for vw to become the world no. 1 porsche ran up 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.2 billion -rrb- in debt when it tried to secure a majority stake in a volkswagen as part of a failed bid to takeover vw .
vw expects the merger with porsche to boost earnings by about 700 million euros a year to put it in a position to challenge japan 's toyota as the world 's biggest carmaker . " porsche and vw are taking a big step towards the top of the world , " said vw chief financial officer dieter poetsch .
meanwhile , on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday the markets reacted negatively to confirmation of vw 's takeover of porsche with shares plummeting more than 15 percent .
traders view the 3.3-billion-euro price tag for a 42 percent share of vw as too high and are annoyed that lower saxony retains it privileged voting rights .
on top of this , vw still needs a 4-billion-euro capital increase to finalize the merger. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "

scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .
combat 18 is the armed wing of the british neo-nazi organization blood & honour , which has carried out violent racist attacks on immigrants in the uk , belgium , russia and germany. nrt / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.08.2009 threat to pakistani nuclear arsenal is real , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's military displays its ghauri missile , which can carry nuclear warheads pakistan 's nuclear weapons facilities were attacked three times in 2007 and 2008 by extremists , a recently published report says .
the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "

the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.08.2009 threat to pakistani nuclear arsenal is real , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's military displays its ghauri missile , which can carry nuclear warheads pakistan 's nuclear weapons facilities were attacked three times in 2007 and 2008 by extremists , a recently published report says .
the incidents highlight how difficult it is to keep the weapons safe . for the international security community it is considered a worst-case scenario .
the prospect that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons has been worrying non-proliferation analysts for years .
and ever since al qaeda has stated its intent to acquire such weapons , those worries have only increased .
just last month , the leader of the terror group in afghanistan said in an interview with al jazeera television that al qaeda would use pakistan 's nuclear weapons against the us if it could get its hands on them .
and according to an article by shaun gregory , head of the pakistan security research unit at the university of bradford , there are plenty of reasons to take that threat seriously .
as gregory details in a piece for the combating terrorism center of the us military academy at west point , extremists have attacked pakistani nuclear weapons facilities twice in 2007 and once in 2008 .
gregory concludes that the taliban and al qaeda present a " real and present danger " for pakistan 's nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's military denied there was a danger that the country 's nuclear arsenal could fall in the hands of terrorists and said that no nuclear arms were involved in any of the three incidents .
in the us , the pentagon affirmed that it is comfortable with the measures pakistan has in place to protect its nuclear weapons . radiological attack still , despite these official assurances , experts maintain that the threat to pakistan 's nuclear arsenal is ongoing and must be taken seriously . " probably the smallest problem is the danger of theft of an operational nuclear weapon , " says oliver meier , international representative of the arms control association .
because pakistan stores the components of its nuclear weapons separately during peace times , it would be impossible to steal an operational weapon .
" what is worrying though is that components of nuclear material may be stolen or lost and that could also be used of course for a radiological attack , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army recently managed to recapture the swat valley from the taliban after heavy fighting while storing nuclear weapons parts separately prevents theft of an operational weapon , there is also a downside to the practice , explains jochen hippler , a pakistan expert at the university of duisburg .
" on the other hand spreading out the nuclear warheads - and we may be talking about 60 to 70 warheads - increases the number of facilities where they are stored .
so even without knowing where they are , it 's not unlikely that the taliban might attack a military facility which does have nuclear components being stored there . "
so while it appears highly unlikely that extremists can steal an assembled nuclear weapon in peace time , a more realistic scenario involves the cooperation between terror groups and individuals with access to pakistan 's nuclear secrets .
" there is quite a large danger that people inside pakistan 's nuclear complex might feel tempted to share material or knowledge that could be used to build nuclear weapons with terrorists , " says meier , citing the example of a former director of pakistan 's atomic energy commission who was in touch with osama bin laden in the late 1990s .
" so we 've had instances that give cause to worrying . "
difficult screening meier concedes that the pakistani government has a system of screening and checking its nuclear personnel in place .
" but given the fact that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 scientists working in the nuclear weapons complex and probably as far as we know about 70,000 people all in all working in the nuclear weapons complex , this is a very large number of people to keep screening . "
however , meier 's colleague , jochen hippler argues that the threat of islamists infiltrating the pakistani military has significantly decreased in recent years .
" i would make the point that it is definitely less of a danger than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
it was a big deal in the zia-ul-haq times . "
hippler adds that if the international community really wants to secure pakistan 's nuclear weapons then it has to do more than just focus on the country 's arsenal .
" the taliban will never be able to conquer the country militarily , " he says .
" there is no way to do that .
but on the other hand , the pakistani state may just fail because of incompetence , lack of organization , corruption and because the pakistani political elite are incredibly incompetent and greedy . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

the ceremony was attended by a group of germans who fled the area , as well as polish officials who meant to make the event a symbol of reconciliation .
one of those survivors , a 74-year-old hamburg resident named sabina , lived in germany 's easternmost province of east prussia with her family until the last throes of the war .
in the harsh winter of 1945 they caught the last transport bound for the west to escape the red army 's offensive which was moving in from the east . according to sabina , they managed to scramble onto a crowded goods train in the town of marienburg , now malbork , and make it to safety .
but many others were not so fortunate .
the station was packed with civilians desperate to get out as the train was leaving .
" there were children there who had marched for days down icy roads with nothing to eat , " sabina told deutsche welle .
" many of the civilians were clearly too weak to go on .
there were stacks of frozen bodies lying in ditches all around the station . "
mass grave reveals mystery of missing germans little was known about what happened to those who were left behind after the russians captured the town until a mass grave was discovered in malbork last autumn .
in it were more than 2,000 bodies .
based on local records , in the town of malbork alone , 3,000 local german residents were unaccounted for after the end of the war , not counting the thousands who passed the town during the chaotic evacuation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dig revealed the resting place of malbork 's germans the victims were first thought to have been shot dead by the russians , since bullet holes were found in the skulls of some bodies in the upper layers of the mass grave .
there is speculation that they may have been german prisoners of war ordered to bury the bodies , and then executed by the soviets .
most bodies buried lower down , however , appear to be of germans who died during the evacuation .
the discovery of the grave was made by accident during the construction of a hotel next to the historic malbork castle .
archeologist believes victims were not executed " i have no doubt that the majority of the victims were civilians whose bodies were dumped into a bomb crater , " said zbigniew sawicki , an archeologist who was in charge of the exhumation .
" the large number of children 's remains points to that .
there are no traces of a mass execution . "
the local public prosecutor 's office as well as representatives of the polish national remembrance institute are convinced that the manner in which the bodies were buried corresponds to the way in which the red army disposed of the bodies of german civilians in other towns before they were handed over to polish administration .
the remains of the bodies discovered in malbork were transported for burial to one of poland 's 13 cemeteries for german soldiers at stare czarnowo , 300 kilometers to the west of malbork .
the organizers of the burial decided to focus on the human side of the tragedy of world war ii in the spirit of reconciliation .
one middle-aged malbork resident who visited a local cemetery where the remains were temporarily stored was quoted by a national newspaper as saying ' these were innocent people who should be treated with respect and have a proper burial . '
a spokesperson for the polish organizers of the funeral described stare czarnowo as the most appropriate site , since 1,000 german soldiers and civilians are already buried there , and the cemetery is cared for jointly by poland and a german organization that looks after german war graves abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.08.2009 unique european languages disappear silently großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some minority languages fade away without anyone noticing there are 23 official languages in the european union and numerous regional languages and dialects .
the german representative for minority languages in the eu told dw which ones are most in danger . karl-peter schramm volunteers as the president of the german committee for regional and minority languages in the eu .
he is a retired special education teacher . deutsche welle : mr. schramm , livonian is only spoken in a part of latvia .
why do you think languages like this one are especially in need of support ? karl-peter schramm : this small language in the northern part of europe has been spoken for more than one hundred years .
it should be kept just as it is - like a local plant species , for example - because it is part of the country 's culture . how are languages like livonian protected by the european union ? first of all , they have to be recognized as minority languages .
then , they are protected under the charter for regional and minority languages .
if the country where this language is spoken ratifies the charter then it is entitled to certain benefits from the state 's culture department .
that means , people can approach the german state of lower saxony or the country of latvia and request support in retaining the language .
direct funding from the eu is only granted on a project basis .
that can be very difficult , however , because the sums of money attached to these projects are more than these small languages can ever spend . how many languages are there in europe ? i think there are at least 150 . and which ones are particularly in danger ? all of the regional or minority languages mentioned in the european charter are especially in danger .
some of these are spoken by as few as 2,000 people - like saterland frisian in northern germany , or by only 10,000 people - like sorbian -lrb- editors ' note : sorbian is the language of a slavic minority in eastern germany -rrb- .
but the differences in support for these languages are n't so dramatic .
each one has to wait its turn and sometimes they have to take it upon themselves to protect their language - with local sorbian or frisian organizations , for example . bildunterschrift : one way of preserving sorbian is using is on public signs what actually happens when a language disappears ? usually , languages disappear quietly .
since the middle ages , thousands of languages have disappeared - many due to colonization , for instance in south america and central america .
there , many of the regional languages disappeared and were replaced by spanish . in germany 's saterland region , it happens because people move out of the region and others move in , so mobility is another cause .
also after wars , because of refugees leaving , there are fewer people left in a region who speak a given language . and at some point , regional languages were n't taught anymore in schools .
and they stopped being spoken colloquially as well .
people would say , ' speak german , then it 'll be easier for you . ' and that 's how languages become endangered .
now we are trying to preserve languages but not only through the european office for regional and minority languages but also the local organizations . do you speak any minority languages ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schramm represents germany 's minority languages in the eu i am a saterland frisian , but i ca n't speak the language very well .
it is very hard to speak .
i was n't born in the region , but have been living in the saterland for 30 years and have been able to learn quite a bit . can you give us an example of saterland frisian ? if you ask ' wie heißt du ? '
-lrb- what 's your name ? -rrb- it 's ' wo hats du ? ' in saterland frisian .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.08.2009 european banks weather credit card defaults better than us counterparts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' shop til you drop ' may soon be an outdated philosophy the global financial crisis began when the real estate bubble burst in the united states last year .
although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .
whichever is closer to the truth is scarcely relevant at this stage .
the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .
4 and that nobody seems to have anything to offer by way of explanation but speculation .
dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .
" i would be absolutely knocked off my chair if this were piracy , " murphy said .
" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "
he said the fact that the ship is carrying timber may lend itself to such an idea , as the wood would be nigh on impossible to trace once it had been safely delivered into the wrong hands .
but it would also imply that the crew was either complicit in the crime or that hi-jackers were at the helm .
closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

closely-patrolled waters heinrich blume , a former captain and maritime expert with extensive first hand experience of the baltic and north seas , says it is possible that not all of the men who boarded the freighter posing as drugs officers got back off again .
although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

but without official confirmation , the story remains every bit as murky as the waters in which the vessel vanished . the whereabouts of a maltese-flagged freighter remain unclear but the media , hungry for the story to move , pounced upon the revelation on friday by the german daily newspaper financial times deutschland that the vessel had been spotted near the cape verde islands .
almost immediately , the shipping company which owns the freighter said the fate of the missing ship remained a " mystery . "
the story reads like something from the first draft of a mystery novel : on july 23 , the arctic sea set sail from finland .
while cruising the baltic off sweden in the early hours of the next morning , the ship was allegedly boarded by a band of up to a dozen men posing as drugs police .
the men , who it transpired were not narcotics agents , tied up the 15-strong russian crew and made away with trivial items .
peculiarly , the incident was not reported to the swedish police until several days later , during which time the arctic sea continued on its voyage .
four days later , the ship sailed down the dover strait where it roused no suspicions whatsoever when going through the routine process of identifying itself and its cargo to the british coastguard .
the captain should have made contact with the coastguard again on leaving the channel , but never did .
and no-one , it seems , tried to make contact with him .
conflicting reports facts about exactly where the freighter was when it fell off the radar are fuzzy to say the least .
some reports say it was last located in the bay of biscay , but others say it vanished in waters between the french town of brest and the english resort of penzance .

the fact is , that the ship failed to dock in algeria on aug .

dr. martin murphy , senior fellow and maritime expert at the center for strategic and budgetary assessment in washington , says there are too many anomalies to glean a clear idea of the fate of the missing ship , but he is reluctant to go along with the idea that the vanishing act is the work of sea bandits .

" it could be a form of insurance scam , or perhaps it is diversion fraud and the cargo will be off-loaded at a different port . "

although he admits he is baffled at how anyone managed to board the arctic sea in the waters off sweden in the first place .
" the area is under the surveillance of the swedish military , " he said .
" they are extremely pedantic , they follow the movements of every ship and i think it very strange that they should miss something like this . "
to dock or to go on ?
blume insists it is peculiar that the captain of the arctic sea should have opted to continue with the voyage after his crew had been roughed about by their assailants , and head on down to the english channel as if nothing were wrong .
but murphy says shipping companies sometimes encourage sailors to do just that . " they do n't want their vessels held up so they offer the crew a bit of extra cash to continue as normal . "
and normal is certainly how the british coastguard described its contact with the ship on july 28 .
so just what has happened to it since ?
with its automatic identification system disabled since july 30 , it could be anywhere .
smuggling theories one slice of excited speculation focuses on the idea that it sailed off-course to deliver a secret cargo of arms or drugs , and several reports suggest that thesis is made all the more likely by the fact that the arctic sea had been in kaliningrad for repairs prior to picking up its load in finland .
heinrich blume says the disappearance in such densely populated waters bears the hallmarks of seriously organized crime .
" this is not about the transport of schnapps or cigarettes , " he said .
" it would n't be worth going to such lengths for that .
it could be something like plutonium . "
and the fact that russia has now mounted a large-scale hunt and is using " all means of detection " to find the missing freighter , has fuelled speculation that there could be something besides an innocuous shipment of wood on board .
but exactly what that might be is unlikely to surface until the ship turns up , and even then there is every possibility that the truth will remain lost at sea .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .
combat 18 is the armed wing of the british neo-nazi organization blood & honour , which has carried out violent racist attacks on immigrants in the uk , belgium , russia and germany. nrt / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn is expected to head the new group speaking in wolfsburg friday , winterkorn said the new group would be backed up by an unrivalled global presence , technological development and model platform .
" we are forming an automotive group with some 400,000 employees , an unparalleled model range , global reach and of course the highest levels of technical expertise , " said winterborn in a speech to volkswagen employees outlining details of the planned merger .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .

under the agreement the gulf state would also acquire stock options that porsche holds in volkswagen .
porsche said in a statement that qatar would buy 10 percent of the ordinary shares held by the car group 's family owners - the porsche and piech families .
this will help pave the way toward a full merger between the two carmakers in 2011 , which would create an auto giant with annual sales of about 6.4 million vehicles .
" it is clear that the group has the force to become no. 1 , " said volkswagen chief martin winterkorn , who is to head up the new merged group .

the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , will retain a 20-percent stake and keep its veto-rights in the enlarged group .
qatar will eventually hold nearly 20 percent , becoming the third-largest shareholder of europe 's largest carmaker .
the porsche and piech families , however , will remain the biggest shareholders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 14.08.2009 germany 's far right becomes internet savvy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media-savyy right-wing extremists no longer use more obvious neo-nazi symbols the number of right-wing extremist websites in germany is rising , with a group charged with youth protection warning that the internet has become the leading platform for right-wing extremist propaganda . germany 's right-wing extremist scene is developing a professional , media-savvy internet presence , according to jugendschutz.de , an internet watch group for german youth .
with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .
combat 18 is the armed wing of the british neo-nazi organization blood & honour , which has carried out violent racist attacks on immigrants in the uk , belgium , russia and germany. nrt / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .

we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not what happened . " if we continue at this rate we are not going to make it , " said a frustrated yvo de boer , executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , following the bonn conference .
he warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before a copenhagen climate conference , where the international community is due to agree on a climate treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol .
negotiators will be meeting in bangkok at the end of september and in barcelona in november .
" it is clear that there is quite a significant uphill battle if we are going to get there , " said jonathan pershing , head of the us delegation .
but he said there were some signs of movement .
" you absolutely can get there , " he said .
hard numbers a number of other representatives , though , said that the best that can now be expected from the december meeting in copenhagen was an " interim agreement " that would set out a basic framework for a post-kyoto accord , with hard numbers to be filled over the course of 2010 .
disagreements between rich and developing countries continue to hold up progress .
delegates could not agree on how much rich nations should have to cut their emissions before 2020 , nor on whether poor countries should have to meet binding climate change targets .
the deepest disagreements , however , were about money .
the un has estimated that , by 2020 , the cost of mitigating and adapting to climate change will rise to $ 200 billion -lrb- 140 billion euros -rrb- per year .
who pays for such measures , and when , is proving to be a sticking point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer left the conference discouraged on friday , a bloc of the poor countries and small island states said rich nations should set aside one percent of gdp , some $ 400 billion annually , to help poor countries cope .
and top un climate official de boer has called for a first pledge in copenhagen of $ 10 billion , to help poor nations map out " solid strategies to limit the growth of their emissions . "
neither measure was adopted .
fundamental changes environmental groups were not impressed by the lack of agreement - but not surprised either .
" the climate change discussion is about fundamentally changing the way we live our lives . it 's about fundamentally changing the way governments do business and that does n't come easy , " said kim carstensen of the world wide fund for nature .
in discussions like those in bonn , he said , delegates " talk about huge issues - like how much money is going to be transferred from the north to the south , about how we are going to deal with technology development and technology sharing in the world , how we 're going to deal with issues of managing the natural forces and climate and weather extremes around us . "
each of those issues has caused years of discussion , said carstensen , and taking them all into one regime is bound to be difficult , which means that delegates will have their work cut out for them if they are to find success in copenhagen. mrh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 14.08.2009 germany 's far right becomes internet savvy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media-savyy right-wing extremists no longer use more obvious neo-nazi symbols the number of right-wing extremist websites in germany is rising , with a group charged with youth protection warning that the internet has become the leading platform for right-wing extremist propaganda . germany 's right-wing extremist scene is developing a professional , media-savvy internet presence , according to jugendschutz.de , an internet watch group for german youth .
with 1,707 neo-nazi websites currently available on the world wide web , stefan glaser , who heads the watchdog , says right-wing groups have quickly learned how to use the internet to their advantage .
" they have websites which are quite modern , which are hip , which are interesting for young people .
videos and music are important factors , and they use all the common web 2.0 platforms : social networks and video platforms to put out their propaganda , " he says .
one of the main problems , according to glaser , is the level of sophistication .
colorful and subtle web portals mean that young people , the target audience , often do n't know they are viewing a neo-nazi site .
shutting down far right glaser 's group , an initiative funded by the federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and active since 2000 , works specifically to root out websites deemed to be targeting young people .
most commonly , jugendschutz.de contacts the web provider , who can pull the offending material .
if the internet portal is illegal , the watchdog passes the details on to the police , who can press charges .
despite small successes , there are still more than 1,500 active , illegal websites and no sign that the right 's internet presence is on the decline .
thomas krueger , the bpb 's head , says more people need to get involved in fighting right-wing extremism online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people do n't always know that they are on a neo-nazi website " i think extremism is part of our open society and we can not have a society without extremism , but what we need is a controversial debate to bring about more democracy on the net .
we need the web community to take part in the process to get these websites shut down , " he says .
in some cases internet users have managed to close down sites by bombarding them from other web portals .
fight continues both the bpb and jugendschutz.de have called for more public education , while they themselves offer workshops to teach young people how to identify right-wing extremist groups .
jugendschutz.de can claim a measure of success .
in 2008 , 80 percent of german right-wing extremist online material that was liable under federal law was removed from within germany and from websites abroad .
more sobering is the statistic that only 16 percent of all the material was illegal , with many hate-filled websites managing to keep just this side of the law .
krueger says he expects right-wing internet sites to continue becoming more effective and more ubiquitous .
at the same time , he expects their development to provoke more powerful counterstrategies and to contribute to a stronger discourse in germany about how the country deals with all kinds of extremist views .

polls show support for the spd at a record low . it is only six weeks until germans head to the polls in a general election and prospects are as grim as they could be for frank-walter steinmeier .
he 's the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor but most of all he is the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate to become the country 's next chancellor . if germans voters were to cast their ballots today , the spd would get a mere 22 percent - one percentage point less than in the previous week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinion polls see the cdu and fdp on their way into the bundestag current polls see cdu and fdp ahead that is the worst result ever for the party the deutschlandtrend opinion polls commissioned for public broadcaster ard . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , combined with their sister party , the bavaria-based christian social union , would get a comfortable 37 percent - up two percent .
steinmeier 's spd is the junior partner in the grand coalition with the merkel 's christian democrats .
both parties have repeatedly said that they do n't want to continue in their uneasy grand coalition after the september 27 vote .
the opinion poll puts merkel on track to become chancellor of a right-of-center coalition .
the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , are on 15 percent support , which would give the cdu and fdp combined a majority of 52 percent .
the green party would get 12 percent according to the poll while the left party would get 9 percent .
speaking during a stop on the campaign trail , steinmeier told reporters that he was not discouraged by the new figures .

he said there were some opinion polls he liked and some that he did n't , but admitted that he was n't too happy about the recent ratings .
but he stressed that if you know that if your policy is on the right track , " then you ca n't allow opinion polls to get you all too worried . "
steinmeier says he 's confident that the remaining six weeks are enough time to turn the voters favor in his direction .
but when it comes to direct comparison between foreign minister and vice chancellor steinmeier and chancellor merkel , the gap is even wider .
merkel has a comfortable lead with 62 percent over steinmeier with 23 percent. ai / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at over 1.7 million square kilometers -lrb- 656,000 square miles -rrb- , it 's the largest area of fresh water ice in the northern hemisphere .
scientists have predicted that if the greenland ice sheet were to completely melt , ocean levels could go up by seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- , which would have catastrophic effects for low-lying coastal regions across the globe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as glaciers move they leave behind giant paths of boulders and gravel called moraines while scientists ca n't agree on how much or how fast the greenland ice sheet will melt , what is certain is that the arctic is warming up faster than the rest of the planet and that greenland is already losing a large portion of its ice .
as scientists continue to debate and take measurements , the effects of climate change are already visible on the island . ice as far as the eye can see the boundary between land and ice is striking .
at the edge , close to the moraine , ice is a dirty grey color .
a half a kilometer on , it 's sparkling silvery-white in the arctic summer sunshine . this far in , the ice is approximately 250 meters thick , according to glacial guide niklas , who did n't give his last name .
in the middle of the ice cap , where the ice is deepest , it is 3.2 kilometers thick . around 10 years ago , the ice was 40 meters higher than today and the gravel road that leads here from the nearest town , kangerlussuaq , ran up to the edge of the ice , niklas said .
he added that he is n't sure whether the decrease is a result of climate change , but since climate change has become a popular topic in the media , more visitors have been coming to greenland . " they want to see the beautiful country of greenland , " he said .
" but they want to see if the talk about climate change is correct - and they want to see the ice . " ice : a " hot " topic for scientists one of the many visitors wanting to see greenland 's ice is christine hvidberg , from the ice and climate group at the university of copenhagen .
she normally works on ice floe modeling , but she 's spending part of her summer at kangerlussuaq organizing logistics for north greenland eemian ice drilling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town ilulissat has become a bit of a hotspot for tourists who come to see the vanishing ice the international consortium that operates an ice core drilling camp three hours flight out onto the ice .
the information gathered helps show what the climate was like in the past , which helps to make climate models for the future . but the process involves extremely complex interactions and a lot of different factors , according to hvidberg .
rising temperatures , for example , cause snowfall to increase which causes the ice sheet to gain in mass .
however , it will also lose more mass because of melt in the summer . " at the moment people believe that the greenland ice sheet is losing mass , but still it 's something we have to work on better to predict the future changes , " she added . ice flow speeding up one of the factors which still requires further research and inclusion in the models is the effect of ice streams .
these are parts of the ice sheet that flow faster than the rest .
the most famous example in greenland is the sermeq kujalleq glacier , or " jakobshavn , " as it is still sometimes referred to in danish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with enough winter ice and snow dog sledding can be a convenient form of transportation that 's where the ice is streaming very quickly - about one meter per hour - into the jakobshavn ice fjord , where it breaks off as ice bergs .
in recent years , the sermeq kujalleq glacier has retreated by some 15 kilometers . while the scientists take advantage of the bright , arctic summer to work on their research , tourists also travel to jakobshavn , or ilulissat , as the town on the ice fjord is known these days in greenlandic .
they want to see the natural spectacle of a glacier calving ice bergs into the fjord . captain ande hofers takes small groups out to the glaciers on his boat , the " pearl . "
he has worked on these waters for almost 40 years , and is quick to talk about the significant changes in the climatic conditions that are affecting his everyday life , especially in winter : hofers can remember a time just a few years ago when they used to be able to travel by dogsled to other towns with their football team or to other sporting events . " we ca n't do that anymore , these days , we have to fly , " he said .
" we used to be able to cross the entire disko bay on our sleds to hunt in winter .
today we have to stay close to the coast .
the ice is only stable for about a month . " polar bears or potatoes ? some see greenland as a climate change winner .
less ice on the sea means easier passage for ships .
it will be easier to look for oil and gas reserves and to mine minerals from the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice would make shipping easier but not everyone views climate change from that point of view .
laali berthelsen is one of the few greenland-born guides working in the island 's tourist industry , which still has a long way to develop .
she said she has mixed feelings and puts the greenlanders ' dilemma in a nutshell . " in south greenland they have gardens and are starting to have small farms , so that 's good because then they can have their own potatoes and stuff , " berthelsen said .
" but greenland is known to be the cold place where we have ice-bergs and bears and whales .
i 'm afraid we will lose all of that stuff that makes up our identity . " author : irene quaile -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

neale lytollis in berlin has this postcard . orson welles as harry lime in " the third man " famously said : " in italy for 30 years under the borgias they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed ; they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
in switzerland they had brotherly love , 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis sent us this postcard from berlin lime 's little delivery from atop a ferris wheel in vienna , while perhaps a tad facetious , does make an important point : politics does n't seem to follow any logical pattern .
the most horrendous of political systems can throw up some quite spectacular human achievements while a political utopia can be riddled with corruption and unfairness once you scratch away at the glossy surface .
despite the fact that i do n't vote , i would consider myself to be quite a political person .
but then , who is n't ?
to say , " i 'm not interested in or affected by politics " is kind of like saying , " i can well manage to pass a day without oxygen . "
politics , whether we actively engage in it or not , is all around us .
i do have some very definite political ideas about things like social welfare , illegal immigration , education , care for the elderly , and social inclusion projects , for example .
but despite these convictions , i 'm never inspired to go to the polls and vote .
however , as a rather talented big-mouth , i am quite content to instigate lengthy and convincing arguments about these topics without really having the slightest idea of what i 'm talking about .
not unlike the average politician in fact .
and most politicians , as we know , are very definitely average .
parties these days need to come up with new and exciting ways to engage people and encourage them to exercise their right to vote .
the younger generation of internet addicts have even been motivated to leave their bedrooms and get involved .
the pirate party , which started life in sweden , has come up with an agenda which speaks very specifically to young people .
many of their policies are connected with internet privacy and file sharing - issues which young people can identify with .
in sweden , the youth branch of the party , the young pirates , now boasts around 21,000 members and the organization already has a strong foothold in germany .
so to raise awareness , you can either be utterly cutting edge and address issues the mainstream parties are reluctant to touch on or ... you can be silly .
die partei is a political party founded in 2004 by the editors of germany 's premier satirical magazine , titanic .
partei is an acronym which roughly translates into english as the party for work , rule-of-law , protection of animals , advancement of elites , and grassroots-democratic initiatives .
despite that rather long-winded name , the party has a knowing " nudge-nudge , wink-wink " approach to politics .
many of its policies are already addressed by other parties : issues such as introducing a new constitution , reforming the health system , and overhauling the existing hartz iv unemployment benefits .
what gives die partei the edge is their satirical roots .
they spend their working day ribbing politicians and wading through the existing political hogwash .
for that reason alone , they could be regarded as being more credible .
however , their manifesto point of wanting to rebuild the berlin wall - something which apparently 20 percent of germans would like to see happen - would be rather embarrassing given that the country is in the grip of commemorating 20 years since they finally got rid of it .
but stranger things have happened .
in the uk , the monster raving loony party , founded by the flamboyant screaming lord sutch , was always the laughing stock of british politics yet despite the apparent silliness of the party 's policies , much of what they say makes sense .
their recent manifesto includes such gems as the introduction of a 99 pence coin to save on change , allowing drivers to drive right over the top of a roundabout if there are no other cars present simply because it 's more exciting , and the transfer of an mp 's 118,000-pound expense account to the poor " so they can waste it . "
in light of the recent expenses scandals in the uk , the last point alone should be enough to get the raving loonies more seats in parliament .
the point seems to be that it 's not really the policies that are important , but the way in which they are presented .
most politicians are lucky enough to be blessed with a brain and a modicum of common sense to the extent that they can all , to a greater or a lesser extent , see what is wrong in society and figure out ways to change it .
it 's the approach to the politics which is important .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die partei would resurrect the berlin wall does politics have to be dreary and depressing , a constant monotonous drone akin to fridge noise , occasionally punctuated by the odd sex scandal ?
or can it be bright and colorful , wry and knowing , sarcastic and silly and yet still speak to people and make a difference ?
i know which one of the two options i 'd go for .
with the knowing winks of die partei and the current campaigning of german comedian hape kerkeling 's grotesque creation horst schlaemmer , germany is finally getting to grips with a bit of silliness in the otherwise drab world of politics .
but will a flashy new party inspire me to trek to the polling station and cast my vote ?
probably not .
i 'm more content to talk about politics without actually doing anything about it .
it seems i have more in common with the average politician than i initially thought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.08.2009 european banks weather credit card defaults better than us counterparts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' shop til you drop ' may soon be an outdated philosophy the global financial crisis began when the real estate bubble burst in the united states last year .
although some experts are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over , another bubble now appears ready to burst . banks in the us are facing new troubles .
consumers who can no longer pay their bills , their mortgages , or debt run up on their credit cards threaten to trigger a tsunami of credit defaults .
the estimated $ 80 billion -lrb- 56 billion euros -rrb- in outstanding credit card debt could upset the liquidity of credit card companies and banks , warns john ulzheimer , a credit card expert at the consumer website credit.com.
" today , the value of homes is going down rather than up , so there really is no equity to pull out of homes to pay down credit card debt , " he says .
" what you end up with is a consumer with a large amount of credit card debt , no equity in the home to fall back on , an increasing unemployment rate – and all of these things together really spell disaster , not only for the card-holder , but also for the credit card issuer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national debt is now more than 4,400 euros per person what about europe ?
in most european countries , including germany , banks are less worried about consumer debt , because people use their credit cards differently .
they generally do not use their cards to bankroll a lifestyle they can not afford .
to be on the safe side , german banks , deutsche bank and commerzbank , have each set aside one billion euros for credit defaults , a drop in the bucket compared to the us .
it 's a mentality issue , says matthias hoehnisch , director of credit card business at germany 's national savings and loan association .
customers in germany behave differently to customers in america .
" we have noticed that many german customers exercise a very strong controlled behavior , " hoehnisch said .
" using credit cards to roll over debt is not done in germany . "
pay as you go , or charge it in the us , consumers have what are called " revolving cards , " which allow users to re-pay only a fraction of the debt they have run up on their credit cards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us national debt clock is running out of digits to record the growing figure in most of europe credit cards are so-called " charge cards , " according to peter ehmke , managing director of mastercard germany .
in germany 90 percent of credit cards are charge cards , he added .
" that means all the costs put on the card are repaid in full at the end of the month , " ehmke says .
" it 's different in america , where only five , six , or seven percent is paid back monthly .
the rest is left on the card and naturally mounts over time , if you do n't keep an eye on it .
that does n't happen in europe . "
with the exception of britain , which largely has the american-style system , european bank customers have a checking account that permits a certain level of overdrafts – in other words a moderate line of credit , rarely more than a few thousand euros .
an american 's line of credit runs over the credit card and is much more substantial , easily reaching tens of thousands of dollars on perhaps four or five credit cards simultaneously .
most experts agree , it is a bubble just waiting to burst , but the explosion will scarcely be felt in germany .

in 2005 the defendant was found in possession of 100 t-shirts in the back of his car .
" blood and honour " is the translation for " blut und ehre " which was one of the guiding principles of the hitler youth during the nazi era .
announcing the verdict , presiding judge joerg-peter becker admitted that thursday 's court ruling could open the floodgates , but said that this could not justify judging the case differently .
authorities in gera , in the eastern state of thuringia , had deemed the shirts to be in violation of germany 's strict laws banning nazi slogans .
the federal court said the use of the slogan in english decoupled it from its nazi-era connotations and thus could not fall under a law banning the use of symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
but it scolded the lower court for failing to consider other charges against the defendant and referred the case back for a new trial .
" the lower court did not review whether the accused , by possessing t-shirts with an aggressive slogan , could be guilty of distributing propaganda for unconstitutional organizations or for abetting the organizational cohesion of the banned group blood & honour , " it said in a statement .
the court in gera is to now re-examine whether the t-shirt case is illegal for such other reasons .
a " c18 " logo on the t-shirt stands for " combat 18 " and is derived from the initials of adolf hitler ; a and h are the first and eighth letters of the alphabet , commonly used by neo-nazi groups .

one such gadget - a device to stop a speed boat - is already under development under its science and technology strategy .
at the defence diving school near portsmouth , a team of home office scientists and industry experts are developing a device that aims to achieve what some consider to be the near impossible .
their mission ?
stopping a speed boat - possibly laden with explosives - from reaching its target , without the use of lethal force .
cyber terrorism the device , known as the air launch running gear entanglement system , looks like a futuristic bazooka out of the imagination of a hollywood prop designer .
the us coastguard has expressed a keen interest .
compressed air is used on the shoulder-held device to propel a line from a pursuing boat which drags with it a high-tech , high tensile net to disable the target craft 's propulsion system .
watching repeated trials of the system is admiral lord west of spithead - the home office 's counter terrorism minister .
explaining how the system might be used in the future , he said : " let 's say now we 're off weymouth in 2012 and we 're doing the olympic games , and we suddenly find a boat .
" what we want to be able to do is stop it without actually having to kill the people in the boat , or risk killing the people in the boat . "
the device is being tested at five locations around the uk while a decision is made over its future deployment .
lord west says the " boat-stopping system " is only a small part of what science and technology can do to help counter the terrorist threat .
it extends from cyber terrorism to reducing risk in crowded places and investigating how to intercept new methods of telecommunications , he adds .
" to defeat this terrorist threat to our nation , we needed to draw on all our resources , and what we are very good at as a nation is science technology and academic research , and actually within our industries we can produce really good things . "
the science and technology strategy is , according to lord west , designed to help keep " one step ahead of the terrorists " .
the home office is casting its own net as wide as possible to garner innovative ideas - and is encouraging industry and even private individuals to come forward .

advertisement developers test the device on a speed boat by gaetan portal bbc news the government is appealing to industry , academics and individuals to develop new technologies to fight terrorism .
one such gadget - a device to stop a speed boat - is already under development under its science and technology strategy .
the device is being tested at five locations around the uk at the defence diving school near portsmouth , a team of home office scientists and industry experts are developing a device that aims to achieve what some consider to be the near impossible .
their mission ?
stopping a speed boat - possibly laden with explosives - from reaching its target , without the use of lethal force .
cyber terrorism the device , known as the air launch running gear entanglement system , looks like a futuristic bazooka out of the imagination of a hollywood prop designer .
the us coastguard has expressed a keen interest .
compressed air is used on the shoulder-held device to propel a line from a pursuing boat which drags with it a high-tech , high tensile net to disable the target craft 's propulsion system .
resources need to be drawn together to combat terrorism , says lord west watching repeated trials of the system is admiral lord west of spithead - the home office 's counter terrorism minister .
explaining how the system might be used in the future , he said : " let 's say now we 're off weymouth in 2012 and we 're doing the olympic games , and we suddenly find a boat .
" what we want to be able to do is stop it without actually having to kill the people in the boat , or risk killing the people in the boat . "
the device is being tested at five locations around the uk while a decision is made over its future deployment .
lord west says the " boat-stopping system " is only a small part of what science and technology can do to help counter the terrorist threat .
it extends from cyber terrorism to reducing risk in crowded places and investigating how to intercept new methods of telecommunications , he adds .
" to defeat this terrorist threat to our nation , we needed to draw on all our resources , and what we are very good at as a nation is science technology and academic research , and actually within our industries we can produce really good things . "
the science and technology strategy is , according to lord west , designed to help keep " one step ahead of the terrorists " .

ideas from 59 artists , including martin creed , richard wilson , and poet simon armitage , have been shortlisted for the artists taking the lead competition .
the 12 winning artists will receive commissions of up to £ 500,000 to create new works of art across the uk .
the winning ideas will be announced in the autumn .
artists taking the lead is the first major project in the four-year cultural olympiad , which aims to showcase british art and culture .
bell ringing the 12 final commissions will feature in nine english regions , and in scotland , wales and northern ireland .
the shortlisted ideas include : • shauna richardson proposes to create a giant glass taxidermy case housing a group of three athletically posed 30ft hand-crocheted lions • martin creed wants londoners to celebrate opening and closing the london 2012 olympic games by ringing a bell - from bicycle bells to church bells - for three minutes • richard wilson 's red hot consists of a one metre iron cube heated to the cusp of altered states • a poem inscribed on the rocks on ilkley moor , in west yorkshire , from simon armitage • kate v. robertson wants to breathe life into disused industrial chimneys across scotland using a smoke generator to create " lone clouds " .
artist shauna richardson wants to create crocheted lions moira sinclair , executive director of arts council england , said the many " exceptional " ideas submitted had meant it had been a " really tough job " for the judging panel .
she said : " i 'm wowed by the shortlist we 've arrived at - it offers an exciting overview of our nation 's creativity , and is bringing great art to some very unexpected places .
" what 's clear is that artists really want to engage with the public , whether leading creative events to celebrate london 2012 , or debating key issues such as climate change or the decline of the honeybee .
" i hope people will get involved with the projects , and tell us what they think of them . "
arts council england says it wants artists " to mark a moment in our histories in unexpected ways and places across the country " .
the cultural olympiad , comprising of 500 non-sport events , was a key factor in london winning the bid to host the olympics .
launching the artists taking the lead competition in march , london 2012 organisers called it " the most ambitious and wide-ranging art prize in the uk " .
entrants can devise works of art in any medium , on condition that the art is inspired by the spirit of the olympics and the part of the uk in which it is located .
