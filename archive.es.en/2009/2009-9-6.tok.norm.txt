"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .

but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .
loew called the victory a " good start into the next few weeks " and " a clear improvement in performance .

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .

france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 06.09.2009 anti-nuclear campaigners challenge merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear antivists protest near parliament in berlin some 50,000 anti-nuclear protestors have trekked past chancellor angela merkel ’ s offices in berlin , urging her conservatives not to backtrack on a law designed to phase out germany ’ s 17 nuclear power plants . spearheading saturday 's anti-nuclear march - just three weeks ahead of germany 's general elections - were farmers on 400 tractors .
they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .

despite praising the work of the incumbent coalition with the social democrats , she favors a center-right coalition . germans are due to go to the polls in national elections on september 27 .
on sunday , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- gathered in dusseldorf for the final phase of their campaign .
in a fiery speech to some 9,000 party members merkel called for a center-right coalition with the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " is germany going to stick to its centrist course of prudence and confidence - or is germany going to get lost in untested political waters ?
that 's the question people will be asked to answer on election day , " she said .
" we want you to answer with the best interests of the country at heart .
and then the only answer is to vote for the conservative union . "
polls show merkel leads according to current opinion polls angela merkel could indeed get her way in the september election .
the conservatives are ahead with around 36 percent of the vote while the fdp stands at about 15 percent - which together would just about give them a majority .
but merkel 's lead is narrowing after the cdu suffered heavy losses in two recent state elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier trails merkel in the opinion polls should the center-right combination fail to muster more than 50 percent , merkel might find herself back in the same old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
she therefore defended the work of the last four years praising the achievements in job creation , education , research and family policy .
merkel insisted however that germany would be on a much stronger footing with the social democrats voted out of government .
she accused the spd of not knowing whether to team up with smaller parties on the left and right or to continue supporting the idea of a grand coalition .
merkel avoided making a direct attack against her spd challenger , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , but accused the social democrats of resorting to fear-mongering over a center-right government out of despair over their own course .
in opinion polls that pit merkel directly against her challenger steinmeier , the incumbent chancellor still enjoys a strong lead of 57 percent compared to his 28 percent. ai / reuters / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 06.09.2009 eu commits troops to afghanistan , but calls for improvements in kabul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's foreign ministers had harsh words for kabul the european union has promised that its troops will stay the course in afghanistan .
however , officials called on afghan politicians to help bring an end to corruption , human right abuses and the narcotics trade . european union officials meeting in stockholm called for greater engagement on all sides to bring greater stability to afghanistan .
while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game . " we are determined to increase pressure on ourselves , as well as on the afghan government , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said . sweden wants the international community and the government in kabul to " prioritze objectives , especially in those areas which have seen limited progress , such as governance , corruption and human rights " .
the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .
currently , only 265 of the planned 400 trainers have been stationed in the country , a shortfall that danish foreign minister per stig moller described as " unacceptable " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's carl bildt played a key role in the talks the meeting was also overshadowed by a nato attack , authorized by german commanders , near the afghan city of kunduz , which afghan officials now claim killed at least 150 people - both militants and civilians . " this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .
the swedish statement made it clear that the international community felt that not enough internal progress had been made considering the years of financial and military support from the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in afghanistan , vote counting continues , but the results are already in question acknowledging progress - like the marked reduction in poppy planting and opium production - the ministers called on afghan politicians to stamp out corruption , step up the fight against the drug trade , and do more to protect human rights , especially those of women . " if you have an administration that is corrupt then it is very difficult to go on , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero waldner .
she hinted that european money should not disappear into a black hole , whilst the bloc 's chief diplomat javier solana called for stricter rules on sending financial aid to the government in kabul . italy 's foreign minister franco frattini suggested a conference with the next afghan government with a view to signing a " new contract " between the national administration and the international community . msh / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a server would then track the vehicle 's location while scanning for ride requests .
if a match is made , the driver has the option of picking-up the " hitch-hiker " , and negotiating a fare to cover fuel costs .
there are already several online portals in germany that help travelers arrange rides in advance for longer distances , but the latest cell phone technology would allow for impromptu ride-shares .
" the system opens up a new market because there is no provision at present for the typical spontaneous and shorter trips that take place in local everyday traffic , " said dr. matthias fluegge , director of the " openride " project at the berlin-based fraunhofer fokus research institute .
in order to improve safety , developers also want to come up with a way for passengers to rate their drivers .
developers of " openride " say their new technology could help cut-down on city traffic as well as help people save money on fuel .
it is also being introduced at a time of increasing concern over environmental degradation .
" we are using device-independent technologies in order to make the service available to as many users as possible , " said technical director of openride , anna kress . the new cell phone device is expected to be available on the market as early as 2010. vj / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , officials called on afghan politicians to help bring an end to corruption , human right abuses and the narcotics trade . european union officials meeting in stockholm called for greater engagement on all sides to bring greater stability to afghanistan .
while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game . " we are determined to increase pressure on ourselves , as well as on the afghan government , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said . sweden wants the international community and the government in kabul to " prioritze objectives , especially in those areas which have seen limited progress , such as governance , corruption and human rights " .
the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .

" this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .
the swedish statement made it clear that the international community felt that not enough internal progress had been made considering the years of financial and military support from the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in afghanistan , vote counting continues , but the results are already in question acknowledging progress - like the marked reduction in poppy planting and opium production - the ministers called on afghan politicians to stamp out corruption , step up the fight against the drug trade , and do more to protect human rights , especially those of women .

she hinted that european money should not disappear into a black hole , whilst the bloc 's chief diplomat javier solana called for stricter rules on sending financial aid to the government in kabul . italy 's foreign minister franco frattini suggested a conference with the next afghan government with a view to signing a " new contract " between the national administration and the international community . msh / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- l -rrb- at a practice session talking to coach loew ozil said he had gone into the game wanting " to step on the gas , and today everything went my way . "
but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .
loew called the victory a " good start into the next few weeks " and " a clear improvement in performance .
" if we are more forceful and dynamic , we will create more opportunities , " he added. gb / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .
opinion surveys show that a majority of residents in germany oppose nuclear power .
according to a greenpeace study released on saturday , 59 percent of germans are opposed to extending the life of the nuclear plants. ipj / reuters / afp / epd / dpa / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite praising the work of the incumbent coalition with the social democrats , she favors a center-right coalition . germans are due to go to the polls in national elections on september 27 .
on sunday , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- gathered in dusseldorf for the final phase of their campaign .
in a fiery speech to some 9,000 party members merkel called for a center-right coalition with the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " is germany going to stick to its centrist course of prudence and confidence - or is germany going to get lost in untested political waters ?
that 's the question people will be asked to answer on election day , " she said .
" we want you to answer with the best interests of the country at heart .
and then the only answer is to vote for the conservative union . "
polls show merkel leads according to current opinion polls angela merkel could indeed get her way in the september election .
the conservatives are ahead with around 36 percent of the vote while the fdp stands at about 15 percent - which together would just about give them a majority .
but merkel 's lead is narrowing after the cdu suffered heavy losses in two recent state elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier trails merkel in the opinion polls should the center-right combination fail to muster more than 50 percent , merkel might find herself back in the same old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
she therefore defended the work of the last four years praising the achievements in job creation , education , research and family policy .
merkel insisted however that germany would be on a much stronger footing with the social democrats voted out of government .
she accused the spd of not knowing whether to team up with smaller parties on the left and right or to continue supporting the idea of a grand coalition .
merkel avoided making a direct attack against her spd challenger , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , but accused the social democrats of resorting to fear-mongering over a center-right government out of despair over their own course .
in opinion polls that pit merkel directly against her challenger steinmeier , the incumbent chancellor still enjoys a strong lead of 57 percent compared to his 28 percent. ai / reuters / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .

but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .
loew called the victory a " good start into the next few weeks " and " a clear improvement in performance .

despite praising the work of the incumbent coalition with the social democrats , she favors a center-right coalition . germans are due to go to the polls in national elections on september 27 .
on sunday , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- gathered in dusseldorf for the final phase of their campaign .
in a fiery speech to some 9,000 party members merkel called for a center-right coalition with the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " is germany going to stick to its centrist course of prudence and confidence - or is germany going to get lost in untested political waters ?
that 's the question people will be asked to answer on election day , " she said .
" we want you to answer with the best interests of the country at heart .
and then the only answer is to vote for the conservative union . "
polls show merkel leads according to current opinion polls angela merkel could indeed get her way in the september election .
the conservatives are ahead with around 36 percent of the vote while the fdp stands at about 15 percent - which together would just about give them a majority .
but merkel 's lead is narrowing after the cdu suffered heavy losses in two recent state elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier trails merkel in the opinion polls should the center-right combination fail to muster more than 50 percent , merkel might find herself back in the same old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
she therefore defended the work of the last four years praising the achievements in job creation , education , research and family policy .
merkel insisted however that germany would be on a much stronger footing with the social democrats voted out of government .
she accused the spd of not knowing whether to team up with smaller parties on the left and right or to continue supporting the idea of a grand coalition .
merkel avoided making a direct attack against her spd challenger , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , but accused the social democrats of resorting to fear-mongering over a center-right government out of despair over their own course .
in opinion polls that pit merkel directly against her challenger steinmeier , the incumbent chancellor still enjoys a strong lead of 57 percent compared to his 28 percent. ai / reuters / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 06.09.2009 anti-nuclear campaigners challenge merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear antivists protest near parliament in berlin some 50,000 anti-nuclear protestors have trekked past chancellor angela merkel ’ s offices in berlin , urging her conservatives not to backtrack on a law designed to phase out germany ’ s 17 nuclear power plants . spearheading saturday 's anti-nuclear march - just three weeks ahead of germany 's general elections - were farmers on 400 tractors .
they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .
opinion surveys show that a majority of residents in germany oppose nuclear power .
according to a greenpeace study released on saturday , 59 percent of germans are opposed to extending the life of the nuclear plants. ipj / reuters / afp / epd / dpa / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 06.09.2009 anti-nuclear campaigners challenge merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear antivists protest near parliament in berlin some 50,000 anti-nuclear protestors have trekked past chancellor angela merkel ’ s offices in berlin , urging her conservatives not to backtrack on a law designed to phase out germany ’ s 17 nuclear power plants . spearheading saturday 's anti-nuclear march - just three weeks ahead of germany 's general elections - were farmers on 400 tractors .
they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .
opinion surveys show that a majority of residents in germany oppose nuclear power .
according to a greenpeace study released on saturday , 59 percent of germans are opposed to extending the life of the nuclear plants. ipj / reuters / afp / epd / dpa / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , officials called on afghan politicians to help bring an end to corruption , human right abuses and the narcotics trade . european union officials meeting in stockholm called for greater engagement on all sides to bring greater stability to afghanistan .
while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game . " we are determined to increase pressure on ourselves , as well as on the afghan government , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said . sweden wants the international community and the government in kabul to " prioritze objectives , especially in those areas which have seen limited progress , such as governance , corruption and human rights " .
the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .
currently , only 265 of the planned 400 trainers have been stationed in the country , a shortfall that danish foreign minister per stig moller described as " unacceptable " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's carl bildt played a key role in the talks the meeting was also overshadowed by a nato attack , authorized by german commanders , near the afghan city of kunduz , which afghan officials now claim killed at least 150 people - both militants and civilians . " this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .

a server would then track the vehicle 's location while scanning for ride requests .
if a match is made , the driver has the option of picking-up the " hitch-hiker " , and negotiating a fare to cover fuel costs .
there are already several online portals in germany that help travelers arrange rides in advance for longer distances , but the latest cell phone technology would allow for impromptu ride-shares .
" the system opens up a new market because there is no provision at present for the typical spontaneous and shorter trips that take place in local everyday traffic , " said dr. matthias fluegge , director of the " openride " project at the berlin-based fraunhofer fokus research institute .
in order to improve safety , developers also want to come up with a way for passengers to rate their drivers .
developers of " openride " say their new technology could help cut-down on city traffic as well as help people save money on fuel .
it is also being introduced at a time of increasing concern over environmental degradation .
" we are using device-independent technologies in order to make the service available to as many users as possible , " said technical director of openride , anna kress . the new cell phone device is expected to be available on the market as early as 2010. vj / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .

" this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .

despite praising the work of the incumbent coalition with the social democrats , she favors a center-right coalition . germans are due to go to the polls in national elections on september 27 .
on sunday , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- gathered in dusseldorf for the final phase of their campaign .
in a fiery speech to some 9,000 party members merkel called for a center-right coalition with the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " is germany going to stick to its centrist course of prudence and confidence - or is germany going to get lost in untested political waters ?
that 's the question people will be asked to answer on election day , " she said .
" we want you to answer with the best interests of the country at heart .
and then the only answer is to vote for the conservative union . "
polls show merkel leads according to current opinion polls angela merkel could indeed get her way in the september election .
the conservatives are ahead with around 36 percent of the vote while the fdp stands at about 15 percent - which together would just about give them a majority .
but merkel 's lead is narrowing after the cdu suffered heavy losses in two recent state elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier trails merkel in the opinion polls should the center-right combination fail to muster more than 50 percent , merkel might find herself back in the same old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
she therefore defended the work of the last four years praising the achievements in job creation , education , research and family policy .
merkel insisted however that germany would be on a much stronger footing with the social democrats voted out of government .
she accused the spd of not knowing whether to team up with smaller parties on the left and right or to continue supporting the idea of a grand coalition .
merkel avoided making a direct attack against her spd challenger , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , but accused the social democrats of resorting to fear-mongering over a center-right government out of despair over their own course .
in opinion polls that pit merkel directly against her challenger steinmeier , the incumbent chancellor still enjoys a strong lead of 57 percent compared to his 28 percent. ai / reuters / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .

since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .

france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .

palestinians say peace talks can not restart until this becomes a reality . eu politicians say they are cautiously optimistic that israel will change its stance on settlement building in the west bank , the issue which is currently blocking a return to peace negotiations between the palestinian authorities and the israelis . " the negotiations with israel have not finished and we have some weeks to go .
i hope very much that we 'll be able to get a change of that position , " the eu foreign policy chief javier solana said at a weekend meeting in the swedish capital stockholm . however , israel on sunday reiterated its plan to construct " several hundred additional homes " in the occupied west bank , with transport minister yisrael katz promising an official announcement from prime minister benjamin netanyahu " in the coming days . " netanyahu has so far only offered to consider placing a temporary moratorium on settlement building for a few months , but only after these latest constructions get the go ahead . europe , the us and the palestinians strongly oppose this , and the palestinians are insisting that israel must cease settlement building before the stalled peace talks can begin again . javier solana had hoped that these negotiations could be re-launched on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york later this month .

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "

merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .

it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .

a server would then track the vehicle 's location while scanning for ride requests .
if a match is made , the driver has the option of picking-up the " hitch-hiker " , and negotiating a fare to cover fuel costs .
there are already several online portals in germany that help travelers arrange rides in advance for longer distances , but the latest cell phone technology would allow for impromptu ride-shares .
" the system opens up a new market because there is no provision at present for the typical spontaneous and shorter trips that take place in local everyday traffic , " said dr. matthias fluegge , director of the " openride " project at the berlin-based fraunhofer fokus research institute .
in order to improve safety , developers also want to come up with a way for passengers to rate their drivers .
developers of " openride " say their new technology could help cut-down on city traffic as well as help people save money on fuel .
it is also being introduced at a time of increasing concern over environmental degradation .
" we are using device-independent technologies in order to make the service available to as many users as possible , " said technical director of openride , anna kress . the new cell phone device is expected to be available on the market as early as 2010. vj / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .
opinion surveys show that a majority of residents in germany oppose nuclear power .
according to a greenpeace study released on saturday , 59 percent of germans are opposed to extending the life of the nuclear plants. ipj / reuters / afp / epd / dpa / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .
opinion surveys show that a majority of residents in germany oppose nuclear power .
according to a greenpeace study released on saturday , 59 percent of germans are opposed to extending the life of the nuclear plants. ipj / reuters / afp / epd / dpa / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite praising the work of the incumbent coalition with the social democrats , she favors a center-right coalition . germans are due to go to the polls in national elections on september 27 .
on sunday , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- gathered in dusseldorf for the final phase of their campaign .
in a fiery speech to some 9,000 party members merkel called for a center-right coalition with the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " is germany going to stick to its centrist course of prudence and confidence - or is germany going to get lost in untested political waters ?
that 's the question people will be asked to answer on election day , " she said .
" we want you to answer with the best interests of the country at heart .
and then the only answer is to vote for the conservative union . "
polls show merkel leads according to current opinion polls angela merkel could indeed get her way in the september election .
the conservatives are ahead with around 36 percent of the vote while the fdp stands at about 15 percent - which together would just about give them a majority .
but merkel 's lead is narrowing after the cdu suffered heavy losses in two recent state elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier trails merkel in the opinion polls should the center-right combination fail to muster more than 50 percent , merkel might find herself back in the same old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
she therefore defended the work of the last four years praising the achievements in job creation , education , research and family policy .
merkel insisted however that germany would be on a much stronger footing with the social democrats voted out of government .
she accused the spd of not knowing whether to team up with smaller parties on the left and right or to continue supporting the idea of a grand coalition .
merkel avoided making a direct attack against her spd challenger , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , but accused the social democrats of resorting to fear-mongering over a center-right government out of despair over their own course .
in opinion polls that pit merkel directly against her challenger steinmeier , the incumbent chancellor still enjoys a strong lead of 57 percent compared to his 28 percent. ai / reuters / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game . " we are determined to increase pressure on ourselves , as well as on the afghan government , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said . sweden wants the international community and the government in kabul to " prioritze objectives , especially in those areas which have seen limited progress , such as governance , corruption and human rights " .
the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .

" this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .

despite praising the work of the incumbent coalition with the social democrats , she favors a center-right coalition . germans are due to go to the polls in national elections on september 27 .
on sunday , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- gathered in dusseldorf for the final phase of their campaign .
in a fiery speech to some 9,000 party members merkel called for a center-right coalition with the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " is germany going to stick to its centrist course of prudence and confidence - or is germany going to get lost in untested political waters ?
that 's the question people will be asked to answer on election day , " she said .
" we want you to answer with the best interests of the country at heart .
and then the only answer is to vote for the conservative union . "
polls show merkel leads according to current opinion polls angela merkel could indeed get her way in the september election .
the conservatives are ahead with around 36 percent of the vote while the fdp stands at about 15 percent - which together would just about give them a majority .
but merkel 's lead is narrowing after the cdu suffered heavy losses in two recent state elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier trails merkel in the opinion polls should the center-right combination fail to muster more than 50 percent , merkel might find herself back in the same old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
she therefore defended the work of the last four years praising the achievements in job creation , education , research and family policy .
merkel insisted however that germany would be on a much stronger footing with the social democrats voted out of government .
she accused the spd of not knowing whether to team up with smaller parties on the left and right or to continue supporting the idea of a grand coalition .
merkel avoided making a direct attack against her spd challenger , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , but accused the social democrats of resorting to fear-mongering over a center-right government out of despair over their own course .
in opinion polls that pit merkel directly against her challenger steinmeier , the incumbent chancellor still enjoys a strong lead of 57 percent compared to his 28 percent. ai / reuters / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , officials called on afghan politicians to help bring an end to corruption , human right abuses and the narcotics trade . european union officials meeting in stockholm called for greater engagement on all sides to bring greater stability to afghanistan .
while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game . " we are determined to increase pressure on ourselves , as well as on the afghan government , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said . sweden wants the international community and the government in kabul to " prioritze objectives , especially in those areas which have seen limited progress , such as governance , corruption and human rights " .
the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .
currently , only 265 of the planned 400 trainers have been stationed in the country , a shortfall that danish foreign minister per stig moller described as " unacceptable " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's carl bildt played a key role in the talks the meeting was also overshadowed by a nato attack , authorized by german commanders , near the afghan city of kunduz , which afghan officials now claim killed at least 150 people - both militants and civilians . " this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .
the swedish statement made it clear that the international community felt that not enough internal progress had been made considering the years of financial and military support from the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in afghanistan , vote counting continues , but the results are already in question acknowledging progress - like the marked reduction in poppy planting and opium production - the ministers called on afghan politicians to stamp out corruption , step up the fight against the drug trade , and do more to protect human rights , especially those of women . " if you have an administration that is corrupt then it is very difficult to go on , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero waldner .
she hinted that european money should not disappear into a black hole , whilst the bloc 's chief diplomat javier solana called for stricter rules on sending financial aid to the government in kabul . italy 's foreign minister franco frattini suggested a conference with the next afghan government with a view to signing a " new contract " between the national administration and the international community . msh / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , officials called on afghan politicians to help bring an end to corruption , human right abuses and the narcotics trade . european union officials meeting in stockholm called for greater engagement on all sides to bring greater stability to afghanistan .
while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game . " we are determined to increase pressure on ourselves , as well as on the afghan government , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said . sweden wants the international community and the government in kabul to " prioritze objectives , especially in those areas which have seen limited progress , such as governance , corruption and human rights " .
the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .

" this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .
the swedish statement made it clear that the international community felt that not enough internal progress had been made considering the years of financial and military support from the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in afghanistan , vote counting continues , but the results are already in question acknowledging progress - like the marked reduction in poppy planting and opium production - the ministers called on afghan politicians to stamp out corruption , step up the fight against the drug trade , and do more to protect human rights , especially those of women .

however , officials called on afghan politicians to help bring an end to corruption , human right abuses and the narcotics trade . european union officials meeting in stockholm called for greater engagement on all sides to bring greater stability to afghanistan .
while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game . " we are determined to increase pressure on ourselves , as well as on the afghan government , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said . sweden wants the international community and the government in kabul to " prioritze objectives , especially in those areas which have seen limited progress , such as governance , corruption and human rights " .
the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .

" this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .
the swedish statement made it clear that the international community felt that not enough internal progress had been made considering the years of financial and military support from the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in afghanistan , vote counting continues , but the results are already in question acknowledging progress - like the marked reduction in poppy planting and opium production - the ministers called on afghan politicians to stamp out corruption , step up the fight against the drug trade , and do more to protect human rights , especially those of women .

"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- l -rrb- at a practice session talking to coach loew ozil said he had gone into the game wanting " to step on the gas , and today everything went my way . "
but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .
loew called the victory a " good start into the next few weeks " and " a clear improvement in performance .
" if we are more forceful and dynamic , we will create more opportunities , " he added. gb / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .
opinion surveys show that a majority of residents in germany oppose nuclear power .
according to a greenpeace study released on saturday , 59 percent of germans are opposed to extending the life of the nuclear plants. ipj / reuters / afp / epd / dpa / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .

but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .
loew called the victory a " good start into the next few weeks " and " a clear improvement in performance .

"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- l -rrb- at a practice session talking to coach loew ozil said he had gone into the game wanting " to step on the gas , and today everything went my way . "
but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .

a server would then track the vehicle 's location while scanning for ride requests .
if a match is made , the driver has the option of picking-up the " hitch-hiker " , and negotiating a fare to cover fuel costs .
there are already several online portals in germany that help travelers arrange rides in advance for longer distances , but the latest cell phone technology would allow for impromptu ride-shares .
" the system opens up a new market because there is no provision at present for the typical spontaneous and shorter trips that take place in local everyday traffic , " said dr. matthias fluegge , director of the " openride " project at the berlin-based fraunhofer fokus research institute .
in order to improve safety , developers also want to come up with a way for passengers to rate their drivers .
developers of " openride " say their new technology could help cut-down on city traffic as well as help people save money on fuel .
it is also being introduced at a time of increasing concern over environmental degradation .
" we are using device-independent technologies in order to make the service available to as many users as possible , " said technical director of openride , anna kress . the new cell phone device is expected to be available on the market as early as 2010. vj / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .

hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .

“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .

" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .

despite praising the work of the incumbent coalition with the social democrats , she favors a center-right coalition . germans are due to go to the polls in national elections on september 27 .
on sunday , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- gathered in dusseldorf for the final phase of their campaign .
in a fiery speech to some 9,000 party members merkel called for a center-right coalition with the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " is germany going to stick to its centrist course of prudence and confidence - or is germany going to get lost in untested political waters ?
that 's the question people will be asked to answer on election day , " she said .
" we want you to answer with the best interests of the country at heart .
and then the only answer is to vote for the conservative union . "
polls show merkel leads according to current opinion polls angela merkel could indeed get her way in the september election .
the conservatives are ahead with around 36 percent of the vote while the fdp stands at about 15 percent - which together would just about give them a majority .
but merkel 's lead is narrowing after the cdu suffered heavy losses in two recent state elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier trails merkel in the opinion polls should the center-right combination fail to muster more than 50 percent , merkel might find herself back in the same old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
she therefore defended the work of the last four years praising the achievements in job creation , education , research and family policy .
merkel insisted however that germany would be on a much stronger footing with the social democrats voted out of government .
she accused the spd of not knowing whether to team up with smaller parties on the left and right or to continue supporting the idea of a grand coalition .
merkel avoided making a direct attack against her spd challenger , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , but accused the social democrats of resorting to fear-mongering over a center-right government out of despair over their own course .
in opinion polls that pit merkel directly against her challenger steinmeier , the incumbent chancellor still enjoys a strong lead of 57 percent compared to his 28 percent. ai / reuters / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- l -rrb- at a practice session talking to coach loew ozil said he had gone into the game wanting " to step on the gas , and today everything went my way . "
but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .
loew called the victory a " good start into the next few weeks " and " a clear improvement in performance .
" if we are more forceful and dynamic , we will create more opportunities , " he added. gb / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 06.09.2009 anti-nuclear campaigners challenge merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear antivists protest near parliament in berlin some 50,000 anti-nuclear protestors have trekked past chancellor angela merkel ’ s offices in berlin , urging her conservatives not to backtrack on a law designed to phase out germany ’ s 17 nuclear power plants . spearheading saturday 's anti-nuclear march - just three weeks ahead of germany 's general elections - were farmers on 400 tractors .
they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .

a server would then track the vehicle 's location while scanning for ride requests .
if a match is made , the driver has the option of picking-up the " hitch-hiker " , and negotiating a fare to cover fuel costs .
there are already several online portals in germany that help travelers arrange rides in advance for longer distances , but the latest cell phone technology would allow for impromptu ride-shares .
" the system opens up a new market because there is no provision at present for the typical spontaneous and shorter trips that take place in local everyday traffic , " said dr. matthias fluegge , director of the " openride " project at the berlin-based fraunhofer fokus research institute .
in order to improve safety , developers also want to come up with a way for passengers to rate their drivers .
developers of " openride " say their new technology could help cut-down on city traffic as well as help people save money on fuel .
it is also being introduced at a time of increasing concern over environmental degradation .
" we are using device-independent technologies in order to make the service available to as many users as possible , " said technical director of openride , anna kress . the new cell phone device is expected to be available on the market as early as 2010. vj / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .
by 2012-2013 germany will be generating so much energy from renewables that it will equal the entire production of electricity from nuclear generators . ” energy mix already diverse germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent from coal-fired power stations , according to data from the german energy industry association bdew .
it says 14 percent comes from natural gas-fire generation and 15 percent from renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
france , in contrast , gets about 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it .
on thursday , a board member at german energy utility rwe , rolf martin schmitz , told a conference on global energy security in cologne that independent studies had shown that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running for another 25 years would add hundreds of billions of euros to the economy .
" ideological convictions aside , i can see a lot in favor of the idea , which would be in line with worldwide practice , ” he said .
nuclear issue could become hot topic nils diedrich , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , expects the nuclear issue to become a hot topic , if merkel is able to form a coalition with the free democrats after the september election .
" if the cdu and fdp do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle .
then there will be massive demonstrations , " he predicts .
opinion surveys show that a majority of residents in germany oppose nuclear power .
according to a greenpeace study released on saturday , 59 percent of germans are opposed to extending the life of the nuclear plants. ipj / reuters / afp / epd / dpa / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 06.09.2009 anti-nuclear campaigners challenge merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear antivists protest near parliament in berlin some 50,000 anti-nuclear protestors have trekked past chancellor angela merkel ’ s offices in berlin , urging her conservatives not to backtrack on a law designed to phase out germany ’ s 17 nuclear power plants . spearheading saturday 's anti-nuclear march - just three weeks ahead of germany 's general elections - were farmers on 400 tractors .
they oppose proposals to transform a former salt mine in northern germany 's rural gorleben area into germany 's long-term storage site for radioactive waste .
plutonium , for example , has a half-life of more than 24,000 years . on the eve of the berlin protest , merkel had told the newspaper westdeutschen allegemeinen zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- that a stalled risk appraisal of gorleben , including its geology , should proceed and that findings should be “ open-ended . ”
she also described a nuclear phase-out by 2020 as “ false , ” saying usage of nuclear stations should be extended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractor protest sets out from gorleben a week ago that 's despite outright rejection of gorleben as a site by her federal environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he recently said gorleben storage prospects were “ dead ” and that the future “ belongs to renewable energies . ”
since 2004 the spd has been coalition partners but also rivals in merkel 's cabinet which also comprises her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavarian allies , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
on friday , spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier accused merkel 's conservatives and her potential coalition partner , the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- “ of leading the country into an energy policy dead-end and endangering domestic security . "
also opposed to any reversal of the nuclear exit law are germany 's oppositon greens who were in a federal government with the former spd chancellor gerhard schröder when the phase-out legislation was adopted in 2001 . germany 's parties divided over energy mix the spd says it wants a climate-friendly energy mix with renewables providing 50 percent by 2030 .
merkel 's conservatives and the fdp argue that it would be irresponsible to rush a phase-out of nuclear energy before it is clear that other sources can make up the deficit .
organisers drawn from some 100 lobby groups had insisted that saturday 's rally be kept free of party campaign politics . election candidates were to stay off the stage .
one rally organiser and anti-gorleben site campaigner wolfgang ehmke : “ we do n't really trust the political parties .
after the elections they change their minds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis - germany 's oldest nuclear power station " we are very , very furious that the government never stopped this project and our chancellor mrs merkel announced that she , with a new government , would continue .
we want to stop it . ”
hubert weiger , the chairperson of bund , which is the german offshoot of the friends of the earth international , described any renaissance of nuclear energy as “ madness . ”
“ these plants produce 500 tonnes of nuclear waste every year that we do n't know what to do with .
germany 's attempts at storing nuclear waste in salt have failed . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert weiger , head of friends of the earth , germany “ we assume that whoever wins the elections pressure -lrb- from -rrb- the nuclear companies will increase . ”
“ the cdu / csu would be well advised to listen .
that goes for bavaria as well where even the majority -lrb- of the -rrb- population is against nuclear energy .
" they are stopping focus on renewable energies .

"
loew stressed that " besides the result , the team played a good game .
i saw a lot of good combinations ; a lot of things worked well .
there was much more flow and drive in the match . "
loew can be happy about a number of things , not least of which with the young players he tested on the pitch .
talented midfielder mesut ozil was impressive coming off the european u21 title he helped win for the german side , loew said .
germany shows speed and power against south africa , ozil set up germany 's opener for striker mario gomez before scoring the second goal himself in only his third full international .
the 20-year-old generated the kind of pace and creativity the national team has been lacking for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- l -rrb- at a practice session talking to coach loew ozil said he had gone into the game wanting " to step on the gas , and today everything went my way . "
but he also had praise for striker miroslav klose , who gave him a " super pass , " which he just had to " push into the net " for his goal .
ozil looked like a natural fit alongside captain michael ballack in midfield and his performance could not come at a better time for germany , which is on top of group four , a point ahead of russia , in the world cup qualifications .
germany plays azerbaijan on wednesday , before completing their matches against russia and finland in the coming weeks .
loew called the victory a " good start into the next few weeks " and " a clear improvement in performance .
" if we are more forceful and dynamic , we will create more opportunities , " he added. gb / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , officials called on afghan politicians to help bring an end to corruption , human right abuses and the narcotics trade . european union officials meeting in stockholm called for greater engagement on all sides to bring greater stability to afghanistan .
while acknowledging its own shortcomings , the swedish eu presidency also called on the afghan administration to up its game .

the text published by the swedish government also stressed that preserving women 's rights in afghanistan should be an important goal to pursue . bildt 's most immediate call to the government in kabul however , was to " cleanse " the results of august 's presidential election of any serious fraud allegations , as questions over the vote 's validity continue to marr the poll . both incumbent hamid karzai and his main rival abdullah abdullah have claimed outright victory in the ballot - though a run-off vote between the pair appears the most likely scenario - and abdullah has repeatedly accused the karzai camp of vote-rigging . eu admits shortcomings the eu lawmakers also criticized its own failures in afghanistan , especially its attempts to train the aghan police forces .

" this was a tragedy , " bildt said .
" i do not think we will win this war by killing .
it might be necessary to kill opponents at times , but i think we will win this war by protecting the population . "
bildt also said that peace and state-building , not military means , were the path to victory in afghanistan . afghan authorities must improve despite admitting to failings of their own , the eu nations also made it clear that they expected more from the government in kabul .

mr farage is standing down as ukip 's leader uk independence party leader nigel farage has said the " vast majority " of conservatives support his party 's policy on europe .
mr farage is running against commons speaker john bercow , who was elected as a tory mp , at the next election .
he told bbc one 's andrew marr show that most conservative party members " really think like ukip " , which wants a withdrawal from the eu .
but the tory leadership would " rather not discuss europe " , he added .
running against mr bercow defies the convention that major political parties do not challenge a speaker , who is supposed to stay out of party politics .
' given away ' mr farage announced his candidacy for the buckingham constituency last week , also saying that he would stand down as ukip leader later this year to focus on the task .
the liberal democrats and labour will not contest the seat .
mr farage , who is a member of the european parliament , said : " even if there 's a convention , why should we respect a convention in a place like this , where people have given away our right to govern our own country ? "
continuing to discuss the future of europe , he said : " the conservative party would rather not discuss europe ...
" the vast majority of ordinary conservatives really think like ukip . "
mr bercow , who was elected by mps as speaker in june , has said : " i am more than happy to be judged on my track record over 12 years as mp for buckingham , my continuing commitment to the constituency and my determination to restore faith in parliament . "
the contest to replace mr farage as ukip leader is due to get under way next week .

i looked through a window and saw a girl just running in the street steve kinsella , eyewitness catherine hyder , who lives opposite the flats , said : " my husband heard a girl come down onto the street and was banging on doors to raise the alarm .
" she said someone had jumped out of one of the windows .
we could see the flames at the back and there were a lot of fire brigade people around . "
" it was scary and quite noisy . "
the landlord of a nearby pub , steve kinsella , described the girl in the street .
" i just heard someone shouting .
so i looking through the window and saw a girl just running in the street , " he said .
" all she had on was a t-shirt .
she was shouting ' fire , fire ' , screaming at the top of her voice . "
local councillor howard keal , who lives near the scene , said he had spoken to many people in norton who are devastated by what had happened .
he said : " there is a profound sense of shock that something terrible has happened today in this community . "

there are 24 films in competition for the festival 's prestigious golden lion prize - which will be awarded by a jury headed by taiwanese-born director ang lee .
bbc news entertainment reporter keily oakes is spending a brief stint on the lido , filing regular updates on the sights , sounds and stars of the 66th year of the cinematic bonanza .
sunday 6 september , 0910 local time -lrb- 0810 bst -rrb- well it 's my last few hours in venice and the sun is back out shining again .
it has been a great experience being part of such a lively festival .
i have to say that there have n't been many big star names making an appearance here during the opening end of the gala , although i apparently missed paris hilton and mel b traipsing down the red carpet the other night for the bad lieutenant premiere .
i missed paris hilton on the red carpet for the bad lieutenant premiere obviously neither of them are here to promote movies , i think hilton 's doing some promotion for some jewellery company or other .
i went along to the desert flower party last night and while i was there none of the film 's stars put in appearance , but there was free champagne !
the michael moore screening last night was packed out as the media wanted to get a first look at what he 's been up to since he released sicko several years ago .
he 's uncovered some really fascinating human interest stories about how the economic meltdown has affected middle class america .
but he did n't really offer up any solutions for what could replace the capitalist model he so detests .
there 's still plenty more happening during the final week of the festival , with half of the competition films still to have their premieres .
there is also the first showing of disney pixar 's 3d version of toy story , which will pave the way for toy story 3 which is currently in production .
so i bid farewell to venice as i head for the airport and london , sadly leaving the glitz and glamour of this place to carry on without me .
saturday 5 september , 1900 local time -lrb- 1800 bst -rrb- capitalism : a love story is moore 's first film since 2007 's sicko at an afternoon talk michael moore was once again on his soap box , and this time has in his sights corporate america , blaming it for allowing millions of americans to lose their jobs while the money men were the last to suffer .
he also turned his infamous aggression on the media , failing to understand how newspapers did not see the global meltdown coming .
he considers it the fault of newspapers that there is such a high population of americans that are " functioning illiterates " .
and obviously , george bush gets a lot of stick as well .
whether you agree with his politics or not , he is a fascinating raconteur but there is always that underlying thought that this is a multi-millionaire who has successfully used the system to his financial and artistic advantage .
it is the first press screening of capitalism : a love story , and no doubt there will be some shocking revelations .
saturday 5 september , 1545 local time -lrb- 1445 bst -rrb- at his second press conference in two days werner herzog went into a bit more detail about his latest film to be entered into competition , my son , my son , what have ye done - unfortunately there was no time time to ask him why the dreadful name .
the film stars michael shannon and willem dafoe the film , based on the true story of an insane man who kills his mother , went into production after a chat with david lynch about the prohibitive costs involved in movie-making .
they agreed there should be a manifesto that films should be made for under $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.2m -rrb- , and herzog 's took up the idea for this project .
although he said it was shot " guerrilla style " , with peru and china among the settings and willem dafoe and chloe sevigny in the cast , i find it hard to believe they could stick to that budget .
asked how he feels about having two films competing against each other , he said " well venice never accepted any of my films into competition for nearly four decades " .
the weather in venice today has taken a turn for the worse .
it 's windy and cold and definitely cardigan weather , which is unfortunate as it 's my last full day here .
but at least the milder weather might stop so many mosquitoes attacking me .
i 've also had to take my beloved bike back to the hire shop , but i have worked out the buses so wo n't be travelling in the wrong direction again - i hope !
saturday 5 september , 1015 local time -lrb- 0915 bst -rrb- an early morning screening of hong kong film accident , which is showing in competition , saw the audience faced with brutal death from the opening seconds .
the film is about a team of hitmen -lrb- and a woman -rrb- who carry out hits and make them look like bizarre accidents .
although there are moments of extreme gore , it was actually a complex and clever film .
you really had to concentrate on the action to see how the deaths were being set up , or if indeed there were really just accidents .
the surprise entry for the golden lion competition has been announced as my son , my son , what have ye done , from german director werner herzog .
this is his second film in this year 's contest , joining bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans .
and yes it is another terrible title .
my son , my son , what have ye done , stars chloe sevigny , willem defoe and michael shannon , and is billed as " a story of ancient myth and modern madness " .
herzog himself describes it as a horror film without the " blood , chainsaws and gore " , and it all sounds a bit bonkers .
friday 4 september , 2045 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- on my hired bike around and about in venice i finally made it in to venice proper to see some of the historical sights it has to offer .
it is just across the water from the lido where the festival is taking place , but it seems a million miles away in terms of architectural beauty .
that said , it is also swarming with tourists , myself adding to the numbers , and there is a lot of building and restoration work going on around the main attractions , detracting from any feeling of stepping back in time .
but it is still fascinating to walk around the canals that you have seen so many times in films .
many of the streets look like they have been created for a movie set , such is its charm .
tomorrow sees the arrival of some big name stars to the festival , including director george lucas , in town to honour pixar with a lifetime achievement honour , and michael moore , who will be heavily promoting his latest documentary capital : a love story .
no doubt he will have some pretty strong opinions on the present state of the world .
friday 4 september , 1600 local time -lrb- 1500 bst -rrb- i finally met waris dirie and , my goodness , she was one scary lady .
i 'm not sure what i expected , but she turned out to be quite a harsh person - with trust issues .
although i support her campaign against female circumcision and obviously can not understand her personal struggles , her personality makes it difficult to warm to her .
in contrast , the actress that plays her in the film desert flower , liya kebede , was sweet and welcoming , and made me wish she was the real waris that i had been so excited to meet .
friday 4 september , 1430 local time -lrb- 1330 bst -rrb- german director werner herzog joined bad lieutenant stars mendes and cage director yonfan was a lovely man to interview .
but i felt more than a little embarrassed when i politely asked how his english was , to which he modestly replied " so-so " and then launched into a discussion about post-modernism in film .
a press conference for the remake of the bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans -lrb- terrible name -rrb- saw its stars nicolas cage and eva mendes and director werner herzog face the world 's media .
herzog did n't seem at all embarrassed to admit that he was unfamiliar with the work of the film 's originator abel ferrara - himself exhibiting at the festival , but said they should " get together over a bottle of whiskey " .
cage really likes to talk about " his craft " and spent a great deal of time explaining how he and herzog created his role , right down to how one shoulder should be slightly dipped , and how he was born in los angeles but " reborn in new orleans " .
friday 4 september , 1100 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- director yonfan was joined by actresses terry kwan -lrb- l -rrb- and xuan zhu went to an early morning screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film depicting a time called " white terror " when suspected pro-communists were rooted out and punished , often by death .
based on a true story , despite its traumatic subject matter it managed to remain upbeat and raise a smile .
later on i 'm interviewing its director yonfan , and have about 10 minutes to research his work .
british actress shirley henderson is being interviewed next to me by a group of journalists .
while the rest of us are sweltering in the late morning heat , the tiny actress arrives in jeans , long-sleeved top , socks and sandals - and carrying a padded coat !
she really does look like a child so its no wonder she 's been cast in the tv film may contain nuts .
based on the book by john o 'farrell , it centres around a mum who is so pushy she decides to sit her daughter 's 11 + exam for her , and nobody notices there 's a grown woman in the exam room .
friday 4 september , 0730 local time -lrb- 0630 bst -rrb- today i 'm excited at the prospect of meeting supermodel waris dirie .
her story of escaping a nomadic life in somalia to becoming a un ambassador speaking out on the subject of female circumcision is truly inspirational .
i saw desert flower before arriving in venice and while it starts out as a feel-good movie , it actually becomes quite harrowing with the depiction of waris 's experiences of circumcision at such a young age .
i 'm glad i did n't see the film out here as i would have jumped on a plane straight home to give my daughter a hug , such was the profound effect the film had on me when i saw it in london .
i have so many questions to ask her about her fascinating life .
firstly though , to a screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film which i admit to knowing nothing about !
thursday 3 september , 2330 local time -lrb- 2230 bst -rrb- mortensen praised his young co-star 's professionalism i milled around the red carpet tonight for the premiere of the road .
there are so many premieres going on that they have to share the same red carpet on the same night and this led to a bit of confusion on my part when some impossibly beautiful italian actresses and actors came out .
i still have n't fathomed who they were or what they were promoting but the italian crowd loved them .
viggo mortenson finally made an appearance along with his young australian co-star kodi smit-mcphee .
viggo had a protective arm around his young charge while they were photographed by the 50 or so snappers in the camera pen .
he had earlier gushed about how talented kodi was , calling him mature beyond his years .
" we had a great connection , not just as friends , we became great friends , but also a professional relationship , " he said .
" he is someone who did things every day beyond his years .
i did n't really think of him as a child actor but as someone who was very mature , very quick on his feet , very open-minded .
and also , very important for a shoot like this , he always managed to combine a kid 's urge to have fun and make practical jokes and goof around , with complete focus as an actor . "
unlike usual premieres it was only the top stars who got to walk the red carpet , with other guests ushered round the side , out of view .
harvey weinstein made an appearance , and was obviously not ushered out of sight , and he certainly scrubbed up well in his tuxedo .
unfortunately there were no other stars from the film on display .
no guy pearce , no charlize theron and no omar - i mean michael k williams - making another appearance in a festival film .
the red carpet bit took so long i actually missed the opportunity to get into the screening .
the upside was i got the chance to taste some authentic italian spaghetti instead .
thursday 3 september , 1700 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- just spotted harvey weinstein , the boss of miramax films , wandering about near the excelsior hotel , which is where a lot of wheeling and dealing gets done .
despite being one of the most influential men in independent cinema , and presumably one of the wealthiest , he comes from the simon cowell school of fashion - sporting an unassuming white t-shirt and jeans - but with a phone glued to his ear .
his weinstein company is promoting the road , based on cormac mccarthy 's grim futuristic thriller .
the story of a man 's struggle to keep his son alive when everything else around is dying , it sounds like a tough watch .
but the film 's star viggo mortenson assures us it is really about the relationship between a father and a son .
both he and director john hillcoat said they were drawn to the script because it made them think of their own children , while screenwriter joe penhall , also said the birth of his son , and the death of his father , was the reason he wanted to adapt the novel .
despite earlier reservations about the subject , and not being a big fan of sci-fi , i 'm actually looking forward to seeing the film tonight .
thursday 3 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- life during wartime is directed by venice regular todd solondz after life during wartime finally got underway , about 30 minutes late , the technical difficulties continued with the italian subtitles on a delay from the actual speech .
it probably would n't have been so bad if it had been an all-action movie , but this was an arty film , which relied entirely on speech to get any sense of what the hell was going on .
this was fine for me , but the largely italian audience were understandably upset and despite many attempts to get it stopped , with loud catcalls , the screening just carried on out of sync .
at one point the subtitles did pop back into time , but only briefly .
life during wartime was a quirky and at times uncomfortable watch , with themes of suicide and paedophilia - but it had some lighter , laugh out loud moments mixed in .
alison janney was , as always , great as one of three dysfunctional sisters , while harry potter fans may recognise something of the moaning myrtles in shirley henderson 's performance .
there were also a few surprise castings in the shape of michael k williams -lrb- the wire 's omar -rrb- and pee wee herman himself , paul reubens .
thursday 3 september , 1130 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- lots of flapping of programmes as hundreds of journalists queue in the fierce heat for the screening of life during wartime .
although it 's a us film , it stars scottish actress shirley henderson and northern ireland 's ciaran hinds in starring roles , albeit both playing americans .
as the orderly queue descended into chaos , i narrowly avoided being taken out by a giant winged golden lion , the mascot of the festival , being transported to some event or other .
i finally made it into in the vast , temporary cinema but things got off to a bad start when the lights dimmed , then came on again before the film had even started , prompting ironic claps .
some 20 minutes later they are still having " technical problems " thursday 3 september , 1020 local time -lrb- 0920 bst -rrb- hollywood 's nic cage is in venice to promote a remake of bad lieutenant with the big opening out of the way , it 's down to business for the rest of the festival .
there is an endless round of press conferences throughout the afternoon , which will be held in a multitude of languages , no doubt making for an amusing , if not confusing , day .
one of the highlights is the road , based on the pulitzer prize-winning novel by cormac mccarthy .
i say highlight : it looks thoroughly depressing .
set in a post-apocalyptic america , it has viggo mortensen as a father desperately trying to defend his son against cannibal gangs as they attempt to reach safer ground .
charlize theron also stars in the film , but so far it looks like she will not be gracing us with her presence .
there is also a press conference for the film great directors , which is showing out of competition .
it focuses on 10 directors , including bernardo bertolucci , catherine breillat , stephen frears , richard linklater , ken loach and david lynch , and what it means to be an artist behind the camera .
it sounds a bit of a luvvie fest but could be insightful ...
thursday 3 september , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900 bst -rrb- the lido is one long strip of land , set apart from mainland venice .
the hotel is at one end and the screenings and events are at the other .
to save my poor feet , which took a pounding on day one , i 've hired a bike - seemingly the only way to get around here .
i love it , but the only problem will be trying to find it again in among the thousands chained to every available static surface .
if you stood still too long someone would try and lock their bike around your leg !
wednesday 2 september , 1950 local time -lrb- 1850 bst -rrb- us actress eva mendes was among the stars to brave the media scrum on opening night the flashbulbs have stopped popping as the stars of the opening film , its director and a host of invited dignitaries take their seats in the impressive sala grande cinema for the premiere of baaria .
ahead of the curtain going up on the film , the festival director marco muller welcomed everyone to the lido for two weeks of non-stop film-watching .
those who will have squarest eyes by the end of the event are the panellists who sit on the jury awarding the prestigious golden lion .
last year 's winner was the wrestler , starring mickey rourke , which went on to achieve mainstream success , and an oscar nomination .
director ang lee is heading this year 's jury , having won the golden lion himself in 2005 for brokeback mountain .
although he says he is excited to be part of the team tasked with picking a winner , he is also apprehensive , saying he considered it somewhat unfair to pit films against each other .
" but it is the parodox that ' we have to go with the flow ' , " he told the assembled audience .
wednesday 2 september , 1630 local time -lrb- 1530 bst -rrb- actress maria grazia cucinotta is the festival 's official ambassador arriving on the opening day of the festival means hitting the ground running in terms of getting your bearings and registering with the many pr companies who set up here for the two weeks of the festival .
this is n't easy when you 've never been to italy before and , sad to say , speak hardly a word of the language .
and it all got off to a bad start when i confidently got on a bus and went the wrong way - for miles .
one bus journey back and a map in hand and it all got a little easier .
the festival opens tonight with baaria , the epic autobiographical film from italian director giuseppe tornatore .
a celebrated figure in italy , his work has transcended his own country , with his 1988 film cinema paradiso a classic feel-good movie on many a movie buff 's must-see recommendation list .
this year festival organisers have opted to go with an italian film to open the festival .
last year brad pitt and george clooney walked the red carpet on opening night to promote burn after reading .
while the premiere of baaria may not garner as many headlines around the world , its exposure at the world 's second biggest film festival has been welcomed in its home country .
and with the beautiful monica bellucci as one of its star names , it should still get some international attention .
wednesday 2 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- i have arrived in a very hot and sunny venice , having anticipated heavy rain thanks to a slightly off weather forecast .
boarded a water bus bound for the lido , the strip of land where the festival opens today , and the site of many a glamorous tourist holiday .
the public water buses are the equivalent of the old london routemasters , basic and slow , but they really do allow you to take in the breathtaking sights .
the private water taxis whizz by and will probably reach their destination in a quarter of the time .
but as they are at least seven times the price , i 'm happy to just sit back and take in the views .

friday 4 september , 1600 local time -lrb- 1500 bst -rrb- i finally met waris dirie and , my goodness , she was one scary lady .
i 'm not sure what i expected , but she turned out to be quite a harsh person - with trust issues .
although i support her campaign against female circumcision and obviously can not understand her personal struggles , her personality makes it difficult to warm to her .
in contrast , the actress that plays her in the film desert flower , liya kebede , was sweet and welcoming , and made me wish she was the real waris that i had been so excited to meet .
friday 4 september , 1430 local time -lrb- 1330 bst -rrb- german director werner herzog joined bad lieutenant stars mendes and cage director yonfan was a lovely man to interview .
but i felt more than a little embarrassed when i politely asked how his english was , to which he modestly replied " so-so " and then launched into a discussion about post-modernism in film .
a press conference for the remake of the bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans -lrb- terrible name -rrb- saw its stars nicolas cage and eva mendes and director werner herzog face the world 's media .
herzog did n't seem at all embarrassed to admit that he was unfamiliar with the work of the film 's originator abel ferrara - himself exhibiting at the festival , but said they should " get together over a bottle of whiskey " .
cage really likes to talk about " his craft " and spent a great deal of time explaining how he and herzog created his role , right down to how one shoulder should be slightly dipped , and how he was born in los angeles but " reborn in new orleans " .
friday 4 september , 1100 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- director yonfan was joined by actresses terry kwan -lrb- l -rrb- and xuan zhu went to an early morning screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film depicting a time called " white terror " when suspected pro-communists were rooted out and punished , often by death .
based on a true story , despite its traumatic subject matter it managed to remain upbeat and raise a smile .
later on i 'm interviewing its director yonfan , and have about 10 minutes to research his work .
british actress shirley henderson is being interviewed next to me by a group of journalists .
while the rest of us are sweltering in the late morning heat , the tiny actress arrives in jeans , long-sleeved top , socks and sandals - and carrying a padded coat !
she really does look like a child so its no wonder she 's been cast in the tv film may contain nuts .
based on the book by john o 'farrell , it centres around a mum who is so pushy she decides to sit her daughter 's 11 + exam for her , and nobody notices there 's a grown woman in the exam room .
friday 4 september , 0730 local time -lrb- 0630 bst -rrb- today i 'm excited at the prospect of meeting supermodel waris dirie .
her story of escaping a nomadic life in somalia to becoming a un ambassador speaking out on the subject of female circumcision is truly inspirational .
i saw desert flower before arriving in venice and while it starts out as a feel-good movie , it actually becomes quite harrowing with the depiction of waris 's experiences of circumcision at such a young age .
i 'm glad i did n't see the film out here as i would have jumped on a plane straight home to give my daughter a hug , such was the profound effect the film had on me when i saw it in london .
i have so many questions to ask her about her fascinating life .
firstly though , to a screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film which i admit to knowing nothing about !
thursday 3 september , 2330 local time -lrb- 2230 bst -rrb- mortensen praised his young co-star 's professionalism i milled around the red carpet tonight for the premiere of the road .
there are so many premieres going on that they have to share the same red carpet on the same night and this led to a bit of confusion on my part when some impossibly beautiful italian actresses and actors came out .
i still have n't fathomed who they were or what they were promoting but the italian crowd loved them .
viggo mortenson finally made an appearance along with his young australian co-star kodi smit-mcphee .
viggo had a protective arm around his young charge while they were photographed by the 50 or so snappers in the camera pen .
he had earlier gushed about how talented kodi was , calling him mature beyond his years .
" we had a great connection , not just as friends , we became great friends , but also a professional relationship , " he said .
" he is someone who did things every day beyond his years .
i did n't really think of him as a child actor but as someone who was very mature , very quick on his feet , very open-minded .
and also , very important for a shoot like this , he always managed to combine a kid 's urge to have fun and make practical jokes and goof around , with complete focus as an actor . "
unlike usual premieres it was only the top stars who got to walk the red carpet , with other guests ushered round the side , out of view .
harvey weinstein made an appearance , and was obviously not ushered out of sight , and he certainly scrubbed up well in his tuxedo .
unfortunately there were no other stars from the film on display .
no guy pearce , no charlize theron and no omar - i mean michael k williams - making another appearance in a festival film .
the red carpet bit took so long i actually missed the opportunity to get into the screening .
the upside was i got the chance to taste some authentic italian spaghetti instead .
thursday 3 september , 1700 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- just spotted harvey weinstein , the boss of miramax films , wandering about near the excelsior hotel , which is where a lot of wheeling and dealing gets done .
despite being one of the most influential men in independent cinema , and presumably one of the wealthiest , he comes from the simon cowell school of fashion - sporting an unassuming white t-shirt and jeans - but with a phone glued to his ear .
his weinstein company is promoting the road , based on cormac mccarthy 's grim futuristic thriller .
the story of a man 's struggle to keep his son alive when everything else around is dying , it sounds like a tough watch .
but the film 's star viggo mortenson assures us it is really about the relationship between a father and a son .
both he and director john hillcoat said they were drawn to the script because it made them think of their own children , while screenwriter joe penhall , also said the birth of his son , and the death of his father , was the reason he wanted to adapt the novel .
despite earlier reservations about the subject , and not being a big fan of sci-fi , i 'm actually looking forward to seeing the film tonight .
thursday 3 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- life during wartime is directed by venice regular todd solondz after life during wartime finally got underway , about 30 minutes late , the technical difficulties continued with the italian subtitles on a delay from the actual speech .
it probably would n't have been so bad if it had been an all-action movie , but this was an arty film , which relied entirely on speech to get any sense of what the hell was going on .
this was fine for me , but the largely italian audience were understandably upset and despite many attempts to get it stopped , with loud catcalls , the screening just carried on out of sync .
at one point the subtitles did pop back into time , but only briefly .
life during wartime was a quirky and at times uncomfortable watch , with themes of suicide and paedophilia - but it had some lighter , laugh out loud moments mixed in .
alison janney was , as always , great as one of three dysfunctional sisters , while harry potter fans may recognise something of the moaning myrtles in shirley henderson 's performance .
there were also a few surprise castings in the shape of michael k williams -lrb- the wire 's omar -rrb- and pee wee herman himself , paul reubens .
thursday 3 september , 1130 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- lots of flapping of programmes as hundreds of journalists queue in the fierce heat for the screening of life during wartime .
although it 's a us film , it stars scottish actress shirley henderson and northern ireland 's ciaran hinds in starring roles , albeit both playing americans .
as the orderly queue descended into chaos , i narrowly avoided being taken out by a giant winged golden lion , the mascot of the festival , being transported to some event or other .
i finally made it into in the vast , temporary cinema but things got off to a bad start when the lights dimmed , then came on again before the film had even started , prompting ironic claps .
some 20 minutes later they are still having " technical problems " thursday 3 september , 1020 local time -lrb- 0920 bst -rrb- hollywood 's nic cage is in venice to promote a remake of bad lieutenant with the big opening out of the way , it 's down to business for the rest of the festival .
there is an endless round of press conferences throughout the afternoon , which will be held in a multitude of languages , no doubt making for an amusing , if not confusing , day .
one of the highlights is the road , based on the pulitzer prize-winning novel by cormac mccarthy .
i say highlight : it looks thoroughly depressing .
set in a post-apocalyptic america , it has viggo mortensen as a father desperately trying to defend his son against cannibal gangs as they attempt to reach safer ground .
charlize theron also stars in the film , but so far it looks like she will not be gracing us with her presence .
there is also a press conference for the film great directors , which is showing out of competition .
it focuses on 10 directors , including bernardo bertolucci , catherine breillat , stephen frears , richard linklater , ken loach and david lynch , and what it means to be an artist behind the camera .
it sounds a bit of a luvvie fest but could be insightful ...
thursday 3 september , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900 bst -rrb- the lido is one long strip of land , set apart from mainland venice .
the hotel is at one end and the screenings and events are at the other .
to save my poor feet , which took a pounding on day one , i 've hired a bike - seemingly the only way to get around here .
i love it , but the only problem will be trying to find it again in among the thousands chained to every available static surface .
if you stood still too long someone would try and lock their bike around your leg !
wednesday 2 september , 1950 local time -lrb- 1850 bst -rrb- us actress eva mendes was among the stars to brave the media scrum on opening night the flashbulbs have stopped popping as the stars of the opening film , its director and a host of invited dignitaries take their seats in the impressive sala grande cinema for the premiere of baaria .
ahead of the curtain going up on the film , the festival director marco muller welcomed everyone to the lido for two weeks of non-stop film-watching .
those who will have squarest eyes by the end of the event are the panellists who sit on the jury awarding the prestigious golden lion .
last year 's winner was the wrestler , starring mickey rourke , which went on to achieve mainstream success , and an oscar nomination .
director ang lee is heading this year 's jury , having won the golden lion himself in 2005 for brokeback mountain .
although he says he is excited to be part of the team tasked with picking a winner , he is also apprehensive , saying he considered it somewhat unfair to pit films against each other .
" but it is the parodox that ' we have to go with the flow ' , " he told the assembled audience .
wednesday 2 september , 1630 local time -lrb- 1530 bst -rrb- actress maria grazia cucinotta is the festival 's official ambassador arriving on the opening day of the festival means hitting the ground running in terms of getting your bearings and registering with the many pr companies who set up here for the two weeks of the festival .
this is n't easy when you 've never been to italy before and , sad to say , speak hardly a word of the language .
and it all got off to a bad start when i confidently got on a bus and went the wrong way - for miles .
one bus journey back and a map in hand and it all got a little easier .
the festival opens tonight with baaria , the epic autobiographical film from italian director giuseppe tornatore .
a celebrated figure in italy , his work has transcended his own country , with his 1988 film cinema paradiso a classic feel-good movie on many a movie buff 's must-see recommendation list .
this year festival organisers have opted to go with an italian film to open the festival .
last year brad pitt and george clooney walked the red carpet on opening night to promote burn after reading .
while the premiere of baaria may not garner as many headlines around the world , its exposure at the world 's second biggest film festival has been welcomed in its home country .
and with the beautiful monica bellucci as one of its star names , it should still get some international attention .
wednesday 2 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- i have arrived in a very hot and sunny venice , having anticipated heavy rain thanks to a slightly off weather forecast .
boarded a water bus bound for the lido , the strip of land where the festival opens today , and the site of many a glamorous tourist holiday .
the public water buses are the equivalent of the old london routemasters , basic and slow , but they really do allow you to take in the breathtaking sights .
the private water taxis whizz by and will probably reach their destination in a quarter of the time .
but as they are at least seven times the price , i 'm happy to just sit back and take in the views .

there are 24 films in competition for the festival 's prestigious golden lion prize - which will be awarded by a jury headed by taiwanese-born director ang lee .
bbc news entertainment reporter keily oakes is spending a brief stint on the lido , filing regular updates on the sights , sounds and stars of the 66th year of the cinematic bonanza .
sunday 6 september , 0910 local time -lrb- 0810 bst -rrb- well it 's my last few hours in venice and the sun is back out shining again .
it has been a great experience being part of such a lively festival .
i have to say that there have n't been many big star names making an appearance here during the opening end of the gala , although i apparently missed paris hilton and mel b traipsing down the red carpet the other night for the bad lieutenant premiere .
i missed paris hilton on the red carpet for the bad lieutenant premiere obviously neither of them are here to promote movies , i think hilton 's doing some promotion for some jewellery company or other .
i went along to the desert flower party last night and while i was there none of the film 's stars put in appearance , but there was free champagne !
the michael moore screening last night was packed out as the media wanted to get a first look at what he 's been up to since he released sicko several years ago .
he 's uncovered some really fascinating human interest stories about how the economic meltdown has affected middle class america .
but he did n't really offer up any solutions for what could replace the capitalist model he so detests .
there 's still plenty more happening during the final week of the festival , with half of the competition films still to have their premieres .
there is also the first showing of disney pixar 's 3d version of toy story , which will pave the way for toy story 3 which is currently in production .
so i bid farewell to venice as i head for the airport and london , sadly leaving the glitz and glamour of this place to carry on without me .
saturday 5 september , 1900 local time -lrb- 1800 bst -rrb- capitalism : a love story is moore 's first film since 2007 's sicko at an afternoon talk michael moore was once again on his soap box , and this time has in his sights corporate america , blaming it for allowing millions of americans to lose their jobs while the money men were the last to suffer .
he also turned his infamous aggression on the media , failing to understand how newspapers did not see the global meltdown coming .
he considers it the fault of newspapers that there is such a high population of americans that are " functioning illiterates " .
and obviously , george bush gets a lot of stick as well .
whether you agree with his politics or not , he is a fascinating raconteur but there is always that underlying thought that this is a multi-millionaire who has successfully used the system to his financial and artistic advantage .
it is the first press screening of capitalism : a love story , and no doubt there will be some shocking revelations .
saturday 5 september , 1545 local time -lrb- 1445 bst -rrb- at his second press conference in two days werner herzog went into a bit more detail about his latest film to be entered into competition , my son , my son , what have ye done - unfortunately there was no time time to ask him why the dreadful name .
the film stars michael shannon and willem dafoe the film , based on the true story of an insane man who kills his mother , went into production after a chat with david lynch about the prohibitive costs involved in movie-making .
they agreed there should be a manifesto that films should be made for under $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.2m -rrb- , and herzog 's took up the idea for this project .
although he said it was shot " guerrilla style " , with peru and china among the settings and willem dafoe and chloe sevigny in the cast , i find it hard to believe they could stick to that budget .
asked how he feels about having two films competing against each other , he said " well venice never accepted any of my films into competition for nearly four decades " .
the weather in venice today has taken a turn for the worse .
it 's windy and cold and definitely cardigan weather , which is unfortunate as it 's my last full day here .
but at least the milder weather might stop so many mosquitoes attacking me .
i 've also had to take my beloved bike back to the hire shop , but i have worked out the buses so wo n't be travelling in the wrong direction again - i hope !
saturday 5 september , 1015 local time -lrb- 0915 bst -rrb- an early morning screening of hong kong film accident , which is showing in competition , saw the audience faced with brutal death from the opening seconds .
the film is about a team of hitmen -lrb- and a woman -rrb- who carry out hits and make them look like bizarre accidents .
although there are moments of extreme gore , it was actually a complex and clever film .
you really had to concentrate on the action to see how the deaths were being set up , or if indeed there were really just accidents .
the surprise entry for the golden lion competition has been announced as my son , my son , what have ye done , from german director werner herzog .
this is his second film in this year 's contest , joining bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans .
and yes it is another terrible title .
my son , my son , what have ye done , stars chloe sevigny , willem defoe and michael shannon , and is billed as " a story of ancient myth and modern madness " .
herzog himself describes it as a horror film without the " blood , chainsaws and gore " , and it all sounds a bit bonkers .
friday 4 september , 2045 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- on my hired bike around and about in venice i finally made it in to venice proper to see some of the historical sights it has to offer .
it is just across the water from the lido where the festival is taking place , but it seems a million miles away in terms of architectural beauty .
that said , it is also swarming with tourists , myself adding to the numbers , and there is a lot of building and restoration work going on around the main attractions , detracting from any feeling of stepping back in time .
but it is still fascinating to walk around the canals that you have seen so many times in films .
many of the streets look like they have been created for a movie set , such is its charm .
tomorrow sees the arrival of some big name stars to the festival , including director george lucas , in town to honour pixar with a lifetime achievement honour , and michael moore , who will be heavily promoting his latest documentary capital : a love story .
no doubt he will have some pretty strong opinions on the present state of the world .
friday 4 september , 1600 local time -lrb- 1500 bst -rrb- i finally met waris dirie and , my goodness , she was one scary lady .
i 'm not sure what i expected , but she turned out to be quite a harsh person - with trust issues .
although i support her campaign against female circumcision and obviously can not understand her personal struggles , her personality makes it difficult to warm to her .
in contrast , the actress that plays her in the film desert flower , liya kebede , was sweet and welcoming , and made me wish she was the real waris that i had been so excited to meet .
friday 4 september , 1430 local time -lrb- 1330 bst -rrb- german director werner herzog joined bad lieutenant stars mendes and cage director yonfan was a lovely man to interview .

there are so many premieres going on that they have to share the same red carpet on the same night and this led to a bit of confusion on my part when some impossibly beautiful italian actresses and actors came out .
i still have n't fathomed who they were or what they were promoting but the italian crowd loved them .
viggo mortenson finally made an appearance along with his young australian co-star kodi smit-mcphee .
viggo had a protective arm around his young charge while they were photographed by the 50 or so snappers in the camera pen .
he had earlier gushed about how talented kodi was , calling him mature beyond his years .
" we had a great connection , not just as friends , we became great friends , but also a professional relationship , " he said .
" he is someone who did things every day beyond his years .

it sounds a bit of a luvvie fest but could be insightful ...
thursday 3 september , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900 bst -rrb- the lido is one long strip of land , set apart from mainland venice .
the hotel is at one end and the screenings and events are at the other .
to save my poor feet , which took a pounding on day one , i 've hired a bike - seemingly the only way to get around here .
i love it , but the only problem will be trying to find it again in among the thousands chained to every available static surface .
if you stood still too long someone would try and lock their bike around your leg !
wednesday 2 september , 1950 local time -lrb- 1850 bst -rrb- us actress eva mendes was among the stars to brave the media scrum on opening night the flashbulbs have stopped popping as the stars of the opening film , its director and a host of invited dignitaries take their seats in the impressive sala grande cinema for the premiere of baaria .
ahead of the curtain going up on the film , the festival director marco muller welcomed everyone to the lido for two weeks of non-stop film-watching .
those who will have squarest eyes by the end of the event are the panellists who sit on the jury awarding the prestigious golden lion .
last year 's winner was the wrestler , starring mickey rourke , which went on to achieve mainstream success , and an oscar nomination .
director ang lee is heading this year 's jury , having won the golden lion himself in 2005 for brokeback mountain .
although he says he is excited to be part of the team tasked with picking a winner , he is also apprehensive , saying he considered it somewhat unfair to pit films against each other .
" but it is the parodox that ' we have to go with the flow ' , " he told the assembled audience .

this is n't easy when you 've never been to italy before and , sad to say , speak hardly a word of the language .
and it all got off to a bad start when i confidently got on a bus and went the wrong way - for miles .
one bus journey back and a map in hand and it all got a little easier .
the festival opens tonight with baaria , the epic autobiographical film from italian director giuseppe tornatore .
a celebrated figure in italy , his work has transcended his own country , with his 1988 film cinema paradiso a classic feel-good movie on many a movie buff 's must-see recommendation list .
this year festival organisers have opted to go with an italian film to open the festival .
last year brad pitt and george clooney walked the red carpet on opening night to promote burn after reading .
while the premiere of baaria may not garner as many headlines around the world , its exposure at the world 's second biggest film festival has been welcomed in its home country .
and with the beautiful monica bellucci as one of its star names , it should still get some international attention .
wednesday 2 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- i have arrived in a very hot and sunny venice , having anticipated heavy rain thanks to a slightly off weather forecast .
boarded a water bus bound for the lido , the strip of land where the festival opens today , and the site of many a glamorous tourist holiday .
the public water buses are the equivalent of the old london routemasters , basic and slow , but they really do allow you to take in the breathtaking sights .
the private water taxis whizz by and will probably reach their destination in a quarter of the time .
but as they are at least seven times the price , i 'm happy to just sit back and take in the views .

there are 24 films in competition for the festival 's prestigious golden lion prize - which will be awarded by a jury headed by taiwanese-born director ang lee .
bbc news entertainment reporter keily oakes is spending a brief stint on the lido , filing regular updates on the sights , sounds and stars of the 66th year of the cinematic bonanza .
sunday 6 september , 0910 local time -lrb- 0810 bst -rrb- well it 's my last few hours in venice and the sun is back out shining again .
it has been a great experience being part of such a lively festival .
i have to say that there have n't been many big star names making an appearance here during the opening end of the gala , although i apparently missed paris hilton and mel b traipsing down the red carpet the other night for the bad lieutenant premiere .
i missed paris hilton on the red carpet for the bad lieutenant premiere obviously neither of them are here to promote movies , i think hilton 's doing some promotion for some jewellery company or other .
i went along to the desert flower party last night and while i was there none of the film 's stars put in appearance , but there was free champagne !
the michael moore screening last night was packed out as the media wanted to get a first look at what he 's been up to since he released sicko several years ago .
he 's uncovered some really fascinating human interest stories about how the economic meltdown has affected middle class america .
but he did n't really offer up any solutions for what could replace the capitalist model he so detests .
there 's still plenty more happening during the final week of the festival , with half of the competition films still to have their premieres .
there is also the first showing of disney pixar 's 3d version of toy story , which will pave the way for toy story 3 which is currently in production .
so i bid farewell to venice as i head for the airport and london , sadly leaving the glitz and glamour of this place to carry on without me .
saturday 5 september , 1900 local time -lrb- 1800 bst -rrb- capitalism : a love story is moore 's first film since 2007 's sicko at an afternoon talk michael moore was once again on his soap box , and this time has in his sights corporate america , blaming it for allowing millions of americans to lose their jobs while the money men were the last to suffer .
he also turned his infamous aggression on the media , failing to understand how newspapers did not see the global meltdown coming .
he considers it the fault of newspapers that there is such a high population of americans that are " functioning illiterates " .
and obviously , george bush gets a lot of stick as well .
whether you agree with his politics or not , he is a fascinating raconteur but there is always that underlying thought that this is a multi-millionaire who has successfully used the system to his financial and artistic advantage .
it is the first press screening of capitalism : a love story , and no doubt there will be some shocking revelations .
saturday 5 september , 1545 local time -lrb- 1445 bst -rrb- at his second press conference in two days werner herzog went into a bit more detail about his latest film to be entered into competition , my son , my son , what have ye done - unfortunately there was no time time to ask him why the dreadful name .
the film stars michael shannon and willem dafoe the film , based on the true story of an insane man who kills his mother , went into production after a chat with david lynch about the prohibitive costs involved in movie-making .
they agreed there should be a manifesto that films should be made for under $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.2m -rrb- , and herzog 's took up the idea for this project .
although he said it was shot " guerrilla style " , with peru and china among the settings and willem dafoe and chloe sevigny in the cast , i find it hard to believe they could stick to that budget .
asked how he feels about having two films competing against each other , he said " well venice never accepted any of my films into competition for nearly four decades " .
the weather in venice today has taken a turn for the worse .
it 's windy and cold and definitely cardigan weather , which is unfortunate as it 's my last full day here .
but at least the milder weather might stop so many mosquitoes attacking me .
i 've also had to take my beloved bike back to the hire shop , but i have worked out the buses so wo n't be travelling in the wrong direction again - i hope !
saturday 5 september , 1015 local time -lrb- 0915 bst -rrb- an early morning screening of hong kong film accident , which is showing in competition , saw the audience faced with brutal death from the opening seconds .
the film is about a team of hitmen -lrb- and a woman -rrb- who carry out hits and make them look like bizarre accidents .
although there are moments of extreme gore , it was actually a complex and clever film .
you really had to concentrate on the action to see how the deaths were being set up , or if indeed there were really just accidents .
the surprise entry for the golden lion competition has been announced as my son , my son , what have ye done , from german director werner herzog .
this is his second film in this year 's contest , joining bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans .
and yes it is another terrible title .
my son , my son , what have ye done , stars chloe sevigny , willem defoe and michael shannon , and is billed as " a story of ancient myth and modern madness " .
herzog himself describes it as a horror film without the " blood , chainsaws and gore " , and it all sounds a bit bonkers .
friday 4 september , 2045 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- on my hired bike around and about in venice i finally made it in to venice proper to see some of the historical sights it has to offer .
it is just across the water from the lido where the festival is taking place , but it seems a million miles away in terms of architectural beauty .
that said , it is also swarming with tourists , myself adding to the numbers , and there is a lot of building and restoration work going on around the main attractions , detracting from any feeling of stepping back in time .
but it is still fascinating to walk around the canals that you have seen so many times in films .
many of the streets look like they have been created for a movie set , such is its charm .
tomorrow sees the arrival of some big name stars to the festival , including director george lucas , in town to honour pixar with a lifetime achievement honour , and michael moore , who will be heavily promoting his latest documentary capital : a love story .
no doubt he will have some pretty strong opinions on the present state of the world .
friday 4 september , 1600 local time -lrb- 1500 bst -rrb- i finally met waris dirie and , my goodness , she was one scary lady .
i 'm not sure what i expected , but she turned out to be quite a harsh person - with trust issues .
although i support her campaign against female circumcision and obviously can not understand her personal struggles , her personality makes it difficult to warm to her .
in contrast , the actress that plays her in the film desert flower , liya kebede , was sweet and welcoming , and made me wish she was the real waris that i had been so excited to meet .
friday 4 september , 1430 local time -lrb- 1330 bst -rrb- german director werner herzog joined bad lieutenant stars mendes and cage director yonfan was a lovely man to interview .
but i felt more than a little embarrassed when i politely asked how his english was , to which he modestly replied " so-so " and then launched into a discussion about post-modernism in film .
a press conference for the remake of the bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans -lrb- terrible name -rrb- saw its stars nicolas cage and eva mendes and director werner herzog face the world 's media .
herzog did n't seem at all embarrassed to admit that he was unfamiliar with the work of the film 's originator abel ferrara - himself exhibiting at the festival , but said they should " get together over a bottle of whiskey " .
cage really likes to talk about " his craft " and spent a great deal of time explaining how he and herzog created his role , right down to how one shoulder should be slightly dipped , and how he was born in los angeles but " reborn in new orleans " .
friday 4 september , 1100 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- director yonfan was joined by actresses terry kwan -lrb- l -rrb- and xuan zhu went to an early morning screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film depicting a time called " white terror " when suspected pro-communists were rooted out and punished , often by death .
based on a true story , despite its traumatic subject matter it managed to remain upbeat and raise a smile .
later on i 'm interviewing its director yonfan , and have about 10 minutes to research his work .
british actress shirley henderson is being interviewed next to me by a group of journalists .
while the rest of us are sweltering in the late morning heat , the tiny actress arrives in jeans , long-sleeved top , socks and sandals - and carrying a padded coat !
she really does look like a child so its no wonder she 's been cast in the tv film may contain nuts .
based on the book by john o 'farrell , it centres around a mum who is so pushy she decides to sit her daughter 's 11 + exam for her , and nobody notices there 's a grown woman in the exam room .
friday 4 september , 0730 local time -lrb- 0630 bst -rrb- today i 'm excited at the prospect of meeting supermodel waris dirie .
her story of escaping a nomadic life in somalia to becoming a un ambassador speaking out on the subject of female circumcision is truly inspirational .
i saw desert flower before arriving in venice and while it starts out as a feel-good movie , it actually becomes quite harrowing with the depiction of waris 's experiences of circumcision at such a young age .
i 'm glad i did n't see the film out here as i would have jumped on a plane straight home to give my daughter a hug , such was the profound effect the film had on me when i saw it in london .
i have so many questions to ask her about her fascinating life .
firstly though , to a screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film which i admit to knowing nothing about !
thursday 3 september , 2330 local time -lrb- 2230 bst -rrb- mortensen praised his young co-star 's professionalism i milled around the red carpet tonight for the premiere of the road .
there are so many premieres going on that they have to share the same red carpet on the same night and this led to a bit of confusion on my part when some impossibly beautiful italian actresses and actors came out .
i still have n't fathomed who they were or what they were promoting but the italian crowd loved them .
viggo mortenson finally made an appearance along with his young australian co-star kodi smit-mcphee .
viggo had a protective arm around his young charge while they were photographed by the 50 or so snappers in the camera pen .
he had earlier gushed about how talented kodi was , calling him mature beyond his years .
" we had a great connection , not just as friends , we became great friends , but also a professional relationship , " he said .
" he is someone who did things every day beyond his years .
i did n't really think of him as a child actor but as someone who was very mature , very quick on his feet , very open-minded .
and also , very important for a shoot like this , he always managed to combine a kid 's urge to have fun and make practical jokes and goof around , with complete focus as an actor . "
unlike usual premieres it was only the top stars who got to walk the red carpet , with other guests ushered round the side , out of view .
harvey weinstein made an appearance , and was obviously not ushered out of sight , and he certainly scrubbed up well in his tuxedo .
unfortunately there were no other stars from the film on display .
no guy pearce , no charlize theron and no omar - i mean michael k williams - making another appearance in a festival film .
the red carpet bit took so long i actually missed the opportunity to get into the screening .
the upside was i got the chance to taste some authentic italian spaghetti instead .
thursday 3 september , 1700 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- just spotted harvey weinstein , the boss of miramax films , wandering about near the excelsior hotel , which is where a lot of wheeling and dealing gets done .
despite being one of the most influential men in independent cinema , and presumably one of the wealthiest , he comes from the simon cowell school of fashion - sporting an unassuming white t-shirt and jeans - but with a phone glued to his ear .
his weinstein company is promoting the road , based on cormac mccarthy 's grim futuristic thriller .
the story of a man 's struggle to keep his son alive when everything else around is dying , it sounds like a tough watch .
but the film 's star viggo mortenson assures us it is really about the relationship between a father and a son .
both he and director john hillcoat said they were drawn to the script because it made them think of their own children , while screenwriter joe penhall , also said the birth of his son , and the death of his father , was the reason he wanted to adapt the novel .
despite earlier reservations about the subject , and not being a big fan of sci-fi , i 'm actually looking forward to seeing the film tonight .
thursday 3 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- life during wartime is directed by venice regular todd solondz after life during wartime finally got underway , about 30 minutes late , the technical difficulties continued with the italian subtitles on a delay from the actual speech .
it probably would n't have been so bad if it had been an all-action movie , but this was an arty film , which relied entirely on speech to get any sense of what the hell was going on .
this was fine for me , but the largely italian audience were understandably upset and despite many attempts to get it stopped , with loud catcalls , the screening just carried on out of sync .
at one point the subtitles did pop back into time , but only briefly .
life during wartime was a quirky and at times uncomfortable watch , with themes of suicide and paedophilia - but it had some lighter , laugh out loud moments mixed in .
alison janney was , as always , great as one of three dysfunctional sisters , while harry potter fans may recognise something of the moaning myrtles in shirley henderson 's performance .
there were also a few surprise castings in the shape of michael k williams -lrb- the wire 's omar -rrb- and pee wee herman himself , paul reubens .
thursday 3 september , 1130 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- lots of flapping of programmes as hundreds of journalists queue in the fierce heat for the screening of life during wartime .
although it 's a us film , it stars scottish actress shirley henderson and northern ireland 's ciaran hinds in starring roles , albeit both playing americans .
as the orderly queue descended into chaos , i narrowly avoided being taken out by a giant winged golden lion , the mascot of the festival , being transported to some event or other .
i finally made it into in the vast , temporary cinema but things got off to a bad start when the lights dimmed , then came on again before the film had even started , prompting ironic claps .
some 20 minutes later they are still having " technical problems " thursday 3 september , 1020 local time -lrb- 0920 bst -rrb- hollywood 's nic cage is in venice to promote a remake of bad lieutenant with the big opening out of the way , it 's down to business for the rest of the festival .
there is an endless round of press conferences throughout the afternoon , which will be held in a multitude of languages , no doubt making for an amusing , if not confusing , day .
one of the highlights is the road , based on the pulitzer prize-winning novel by cormac mccarthy .
i say highlight : it looks thoroughly depressing .
set in a post-apocalyptic america , it has viggo mortensen as a father desperately trying to defend his son against cannibal gangs as they attempt to reach safer ground .
charlize theron also stars in the film , but so far it looks like she will not be gracing us with her presence .
there is also a press conference for the film great directors , which is showing out of competition .
it focuses on 10 directors , including bernardo bertolucci , catherine breillat , stephen frears , richard linklater , ken loach and david lynch , and what it means to be an artist behind the camera .
it sounds a bit of a luvvie fest but could be insightful ...
thursday 3 september , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900 bst -rrb- the lido is one long strip of land , set apart from mainland venice .
the hotel is at one end and the screenings and events are at the other .
to save my poor feet , which took a pounding on day one , i 've hired a bike - seemingly the only way to get around here .
i love it , but the only problem will be trying to find it again in among the thousands chained to every available static surface .
if you stood still too long someone would try and lock their bike around your leg !

he considers it the fault of newspapers that there is such a high population of americans that are " functioning illiterates " .
and obviously , george bush gets a lot of stick as well .
whether you agree with his politics or not , he is a fascinating raconteur but there is always that underlying thought that this is a multi-millionaire who has successfully used the system to his financial and artistic advantage .
it is the first press screening of capitalism : a love story , and no doubt there will be some shocking revelations .
saturday 5 september , 1545 local time -lrb- 1445 bst -rrb- at his second press conference in two days werner herzog went into a bit more detail about his latest film to be entered into competition , my son , my son , what have ye done - unfortunately there was no time time to ask him why the dreadful name .
the film stars michael shannon and willem dafoe the film , based on the true story of an insane man who kills his mother , went into production after a chat with david lynch about the prohibitive costs involved in movie-making .
they agreed there should be a manifesto that films should be made for under $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.2m -rrb- , and herzog 's took up the idea for this project .
although he said it was shot " guerrilla style " , with peru and china among the settings and willem dafoe and chloe sevigny in the cast , i find it hard to believe they could stick to that budget .
asked how he feels about having two films competing against each other , he said " well venice never accepted any of my films into competition for nearly four decades " .
the weather in venice today has taken a turn for the worse .
it 's windy and cold and definitely cardigan weather , which is unfortunate as it 's my last full day here .
but at least the milder weather might stop so many mosquitoes attacking me .
i 've also had to take my beloved bike back to the hire shop , but i have worked out the buses so wo n't be travelling in the wrong direction again - i hope !
saturday 5 september , 1015 local time -lrb- 0915 bst -rrb- an early morning screening of hong kong film accident , which is showing in competition , saw the audience faced with brutal death from the opening seconds .
the film is about a team of hitmen -lrb- and a woman -rrb- who carry out hits and make them look like bizarre accidents .
although there are moments of extreme gore , it was actually a complex and clever film .
you really had to concentrate on the action to see how the deaths were being set up , or if indeed there were really just accidents .
the surprise entry for the golden lion competition has been announced as my son , my son , what have ye done , from german director werner herzog .
this is his second film in this year 's contest , joining bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans .
and yes it is another terrible title .
my son , my son , what have ye done , stars chloe sevigny , willem defoe and michael shannon , and is billed as " a story of ancient myth and modern madness " .
herzog himself describes it as a horror film without the " blood , chainsaws and gore " , and it all sounds a bit bonkers .
friday 4 september , 2045 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- on my hired bike around and about in venice i finally made it in to venice proper to see some of the historical sights it has to offer .
it is just across the water from the lido where the festival is taking place , but it seems a million miles away in terms of architectural beauty .
that said , it is also swarming with tourists , myself adding to the numbers , and there is a lot of building and restoration work going on around the main attractions , detracting from any feeling of stepping back in time .
but it is still fascinating to walk around the canals that you have seen so many times in films .
many of the streets look like they have been created for a movie set , such is its charm .
tomorrow sees the arrival of some big name stars to the festival , including director george lucas , in town to honour pixar with a lifetime achievement honour , and michael moore , who will be heavily promoting his latest documentary capital : a love story .
no doubt he will have some pretty strong opinions on the present state of the world .
friday 4 september , 1600 local time -lrb- 1500 bst -rrb- i finally met waris dirie and , my goodness , she was one scary lady .
i 'm not sure what i expected , but she turned out to be quite a harsh person - with trust issues .
although i support her campaign against female circumcision and obviously can not understand her personal struggles , her personality makes it difficult to warm to her .
in contrast , the actress that plays her in the film desert flower , liya kebede , was sweet and welcoming , and made me wish she was the real waris that i had been so excited to meet .
friday 4 september , 1430 local time -lrb- 1330 bst -rrb- german director werner herzog joined bad lieutenant stars mendes and cage director yonfan was a lovely man to interview .
but i felt more than a little embarrassed when i politely asked how his english was , to which he modestly replied " so-so " and then launched into a discussion about post-modernism in film .
a press conference for the remake of the bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans -lrb- terrible name -rrb- saw its stars nicolas cage and eva mendes and director werner herzog face the world 's media .
herzog did n't seem at all embarrassed to admit that he was unfamiliar with the work of the film 's originator abel ferrara - himself exhibiting at the festival , but said they should " get together over a bottle of whiskey " .
cage really likes to talk about " his craft " and spent a great deal of time explaining how he and herzog created his role , right down to how one shoulder should be slightly dipped , and how he was born in los angeles but " reborn in new orleans " .
friday 4 september , 1100 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- director yonfan was joined by actresses terry kwan -lrb- l -rrb- and xuan zhu went to an early morning screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film depicting a time called " white terror " when suspected pro-communists were rooted out and punished , often by death .
based on a true story , despite its traumatic subject matter it managed to remain upbeat and raise a smile .
later on i 'm interviewing its director yonfan , and have about 10 minutes to research his work .
british actress shirley henderson is being interviewed next to me by a group of journalists .
while the rest of us are sweltering in the late morning heat , the tiny actress arrives in jeans , long-sleeved top , socks and sandals - and carrying a padded coat !
she really does look like a child so its no wonder she 's been cast in the tv film may contain nuts .
based on the book by john o 'farrell , it centres around a mum who is so pushy she decides to sit her daughter 's 11 + exam for her , and nobody notices there 's a grown woman in the exam room .
friday 4 september , 0730 local time -lrb- 0630 bst -rrb- today i 'm excited at the prospect of meeting supermodel waris dirie .
her story of escaping a nomadic life in somalia to becoming a un ambassador speaking out on the subject of female circumcision is truly inspirational .
i saw desert flower before arriving in venice and while it starts out as a feel-good movie , it actually becomes quite harrowing with the depiction of waris 's experiences of circumcision at such a young age .
i 'm glad i did n't see the film out here as i would have jumped on a plane straight home to give my daughter a hug , such was the profound effect the film had on me when i saw it in london .
i have so many questions to ask her about her fascinating life .
firstly though , to a screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film which i admit to knowing nothing about !
thursday 3 september , 2330 local time -lrb- 2230 bst -rrb- mortensen praised his young co-star 's professionalism i milled around the red carpet tonight for the premiere of the road .
there are so many premieres going on that they have to share the same red carpet on the same night and this led to a bit of confusion on my part when some impossibly beautiful italian actresses and actors came out .
i still have n't fathomed who they were or what they were promoting but the italian crowd loved them .
viggo mortenson finally made an appearance along with his young australian co-star kodi smit-mcphee .
viggo had a protective arm around his young charge while they were photographed by the 50 or so snappers in the camera pen .
he had earlier gushed about how talented kodi was , calling him mature beyond his years .
" we had a great connection , not just as friends , we became great friends , but also a professional relationship , " he said .
" he is someone who did things every day beyond his years .
i did n't really think of him as a child actor but as someone who was very mature , very quick on his feet , very open-minded .
and also , very important for a shoot like this , he always managed to combine a kid 's urge to have fun and make practical jokes and goof around , with complete focus as an actor . "
unlike usual premieres it was only the top stars who got to walk the red carpet , with other guests ushered round the side , out of view .
harvey weinstein made an appearance , and was obviously not ushered out of sight , and he certainly scrubbed up well in his tuxedo .
unfortunately there were no other stars from the film on display .
no guy pearce , no charlize theron and no omar - i mean michael k williams - making another appearance in a festival film .
the red carpet bit took so long i actually missed the opportunity to get into the screening .
the upside was i got the chance to taste some authentic italian spaghetti instead .
thursday 3 september , 1700 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- just spotted harvey weinstein , the boss of miramax films , wandering about near the excelsior hotel , which is where a lot of wheeling and dealing gets done .
despite being one of the most influential men in independent cinema , and presumably one of the wealthiest , he comes from the simon cowell school of fashion - sporting an unassuming white t-shirt and jeans - but with a phone glued to his ear .
his weinstein company is promoting the road , based on cormac mccarthy 's grim futuristic thriller .
the story of a man 's struggle to keep his son alive when everything else around is dying , it sounds like a tough watch .
but the film 's star viggo mortenson assures us it is really about the relationship between a father and a son .
both he and director john hillcoat said they were drawn to the script because it made them think of their own children , while screenwriter joe penhall , also said the birth of his son , and the death of his father , was the reason he wanted to adapt the novel .
despite earlier reservations about the subject , and not being a big fan of sci-fi , i 'm actually looking forward to seeing the film tonight .
thursday 3 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- life during wartime is directed by venice regular todd solondz after life during wartime finally got underway , about 30 minutes late , the technical difficulties continued with the italian subtitles on a delay from the actual speech .
it probably would n't have been so bad if it had been an all-action movie , but this was an arty film , which relied entirely on speech to get any sense of what the hell was going on .
this was fine for me , but the largely italian audience were understandably upset and despite many attempts to get it stopped , with loud catcalls , the screening just carried on out of sync .
at one point the subtitles did pop back into time , but only briefly .
life during wartime was a quirky and at times uncomfortable watch , with themes of suicide and paedophilia - but it had some lighter , laugh out loud moments mixed in .
alison janney was , as always , great as one of three dysfunctional sisters , while harry potter fans may recognise something of the moaning myrtles in shirley henderson 's performance .
there were also a few surprise castings in the shape of michael k williams -lrb- the wire 's omar -rrb- and pee wee herman himself , paul reubens .
thursday 3 september , 1130 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- lots of flapping of programmes as hundreds of journalists queue in the fierce heat for the screening of life during wartime .
although it 's a us film , it stars scottish actress shirley henderson and northern ireland 's ciaran hinds in starring roles , albeit both playing americans .
as the orderly queue descended into chaos , i narrowly avoided being taken out by a giant winged golden lion , the mascot of the festival , being transported to some event or other .
i finally made it into in the vast , temporary cinema but things got off to a bad start when the lights dimmed , then came on again before the film had even started , prompting ironic claps .
some 20 minutes later they are still having " technical problems " thursday 3 september , 1020 local time -lrb- 0920 bst -rrb- hollywood 's nic cage is in venice to promote a remake of bad lieutenant with the big opening out of the way , it 's down to business for the rest of the festival .
there is an endless round of press conferences throughout the afternoon , which will be held in a multitude of languages , no doubt making for an amusing , if not confusing , day .
one of the highlights is the road , based on the pulitzer prize-winning novel by cormac mccarthy .
i say highlight : it looks thoroughly depressing .
set in a post-apocalyptic america , it has viggo mortensen as a father desperately trying to defend his son against cannibal gangs as they attempt to reach safer ground .
charlize theron also stars in the film , but so far it looks like she will not be gracing us with her presence .
there is also a press conference for the film great directors , which is showing out of competition .
it focuses on 10 directors , including bernardo bertolucci , catherine breillat , stephen frears , richard linklater , ken loach and david lynch , and what it means to be an artist behind the camera .
it sounds a bit of a luvvie fest but could be insightful ...
thursday 3 september , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900 bst -rrb- the lido is one long strip of land , set apart from mainland venice .
the hotel is at one end and the screenings and events are at the other .
to save my poor feet , which took a pounding on day one , i 've hired a bike - seemingly the only way to get around here .
i love it , but the only problem will be trying to find it again in among the thousands chained to every available static surface .
if you stood still too long someone would try and lock their bike around your leg !
wednesday 2 september , 1950 local time -lrb- 1850 bst -rrb- us actress eva mendes was among the stars to brave the media scrum on opening night the flashbulbs have stopped popping as the stars of the opening film , its director and a host of invited dignitaries take their seats in the impressive sala grande cinema for the premiere of baaria .
ahead of the curtain going up on the film , the festival director marco muller welcomed everyone to the lido for two weeks of non-stop film-watching .
those who will have squarest eyes by the end of the event are the panellists who sit on the jury awarding the prestigious golden lion .
last year 's winner was the wrestler , starring mickey rourke , which went on to achieve mainstream success , and an oscar nomination .
director ang lee is heading this year 's jury , having won the golden lion himself in 2005 for brokeback mountain .
although he says he is excited to be part of the team tasked with picking a winner , he is also apprehensive , saying he considered it somewhat unfair to pit films against each other .
" but it is the parodox that ' we have to go with the flow ' , " he told the assembled audience .
wednesday 2 september , 1630 local time -lrb- 1530 bst -rrb- actress maria grazia cucinotta is the festival 's official ambassador arriving on the opening day of the festival means hitting the ground running in terms of getting your bearings and registering with the many pr companies who set up here for the two weeks of the festival .
this is n't easy when you 've never been to italy before and , sad to say , speak hardly a word of the language .
and it all got off to a bad start when i confidently got on a bus and went the wrong way - for miles .
one bus journey back and a map in hand and it all got a little easier .
the festival opens tonight with baaria , the epic autobiographical film from italian director giuseppe tornatore .
a celebrated figure in italy , his work has transcended his own country , with his 1988 film cinema paradiso a classic feel-good movie on many a movie buff 's must-see recommendation list .
this year festival organisers have opted to go with an italian film to open the festival .
last year brad pitt and george clooney walked the red carpet on opening night to promote burn after reading .
while the premiere of baaria may not garner as many headlines around the world , its exposure at the world 's second biggest film festival has been welcomed in its home country .
and with the beautiful monica bellucci as one of its star names , it should still get some international attention .
wednesday 2 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- i have arrived in a very hot and sunny venice , having anticipated heavy rain thanks to a slightly off weather forecast .
boarded a water bus bound for the lido , the strip of land where the festival opens today , and the site of many a glamorous tourist holiday .
the public water buses are the equivalent of the old london routemasters , basic and slow , but they really do allow you to take in the breathtaking sights .
the private water taxis whizz by and will probably reach their destination in a quarter of the time .
but as they are at least seven times the price , i 'm happy to just sit back and take in the views .

there are 24 films in competition for the festival 's prestigious golden lion prize - which will be awarded by a jury headed by taiwanese-born director ang lee .
bbc news entertainment reporter keily oakes is spending a brief stint on the lido , filing regular updates on the sights , sounds and stars of the 66th year of the cinematic bonanza .
sunday 6 september , 0910 local time -lrb- 0810 bst -rrb- well it 's my last few hours in venice and the sun is back out shining again .
it has been a great experience being part of such a lively festival .
i have to say that there have n't been many big star names making an appearance here during the opening end of the gala , although i apparently missed paris hilton and mel b traipsing down the red carpet the other night for the bad lieutenant premiere .
i missed paris hilton on the red carpet for the bad lieutenant premiere obviously neither of them are here to promote movies , i think hilton 's doing some promotion for some jewellery company or other .
i went along to the desert flower party last night and while i was there none of the film 's stars put in appearance , but there was free champagne !
the michael moore screening last night was packed out as the media wanted to get a first look at what he 's been up to since he released sicko several years ago .
he 's uncovered some really fascinating human interest stories about how the economic meltdown has affected middle class america .
but he did n't really offer up any solutions for what could replace the capitalist model he so detests .
there 's still plenty more happening during the final week of the festival , with half of the competition films still to have their premieres .
there is also the first showing of disney pixar 's 3d version of toy story , which will pave the way for toy story 3 which is currently in production .
so i bid farewell to venice as i head for the airport and london , sadly leaving the glitz and glamour of this place to carry on without me .
saturday 5 september , 1900 local time -lrb- 1800 bst -rrb- capitalism : a love story is moore 's first film since 2007 's sicko at an afternoon talk michael moore was once again on his soap box , and this time has in his sights corporate america , blaming it for allowing millions of americans to lose their jobs while the money men were the last to suffer .

it is the first press screening of capitalism : a love story , and no doubt there will be some shocking revelations .

thursday 3 september , 1700 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- just spotted harvey weinstein , the boss of miramax films , wandering about near the excelsior hotel , which is where a lot of wheeling and dealing gets done .
despite being one of the most influential men in independent cinema , and presumably one of the wealthiest , he comes from the simon cowell school of fashion - sporting an unassuming white t-shirt and jeans - but with a phone glued to his ear .
his weinstein company is promoting the road , based on cormac mccarthy 's grim futuristic thriller .
the story of a man 's struggle to keep his son alive when everything else around is dying , it sounds like a tough watch .
but the film 's star viggo mortenson assures us it is really about the relationship between a father and a son .
both he and director john hillcoat said they were drawn to the script because it made them think of their own children , while screenwriter joe penhall , also said the birth of his son , and the death of his father , was the reason he wanted to adapt the novel .
despite earlier reservations about the subject , and not being a big fan of sci-fi , i 'm actually looking forward to seeing the film tonight .
thursday 3 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- life during wartime is directed by venice regular todd solondz after life during wartime finally got underway , about 30 minutes late , the technical difficulties continued with the italian subtitles on a delay from the actual speech .
it probably would n't have been so bad if it had been an all-action movie , but this was an arty film , which relied entirely on speech to get any sense of what the hell was going on .
this was fine for me , but the largely italian audience were understandably upset and despite many attempts to get it stopped , with loud catcalls , the screening just carried on out of sync .
at one point the subtitles did pop back into time , but only briefly .
life during wartime was a quirky and at times uncomfortable watch , with themes of suicide and paedophilia - but it had some lighter , laugh out loud moments mixed in .
alison janney was , as always , great as one of three dysfunctional sisters , while harry potter fans may recognise something of the moaning myrtles in shirley henderson 's performance .
there were also a few surprise castings in the shape of michael k williams -lrb- the wire 's omar -rrb- and pee wee herman himself , paul reubens .
thursday 3 september , 1130 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- lots of flapping of programmes as hundreds of journalists queue in the fierce heat for the screening of life during wartime .
although it 's a us film , it stars scottish actress shirley henderson and northern ireland 's ciaran hinds in starring roles , albeit both playing americans .
as the orderly queue descended into chaos , i narrowly avoided being taken out by a giant winged golden lion , the mascot of the festival , being transported to some event or other .
i finally made it into in the vast , temporary cinema but things got off to a bad start when the lights dimmed , then came on again before the film had even started , prompting ironic claps .
some 20 minutes later they are still having " technical problems " thursday 3 september , 1020 local time -lrb- 0920 bst -rrb- hollywood 's nic cage is in venice to promote a remake of bad lieutenant with the big opening out of the way , it 's down to business for the rest of the festival .
there is an endless round of press conferences throughout the afternoon , which will be held in a multitude of languages , no doubt making for an amusing , if not confusing , day .
one of the highlights is the road , based on the pulitzer prize-winning novel by cormac mccarthy .
i say highlight : it looks thoroughly depressing .
set in a post-apocalyptic america , it has viggo mortensen as a father desperately trying to defend his son against cannibal gangs as they attempt to reach safer ground .
charlize theron also stars in the film , but so far it looks like she will not be gracing us with her presence .
there is also a press conference for the film great directors , which is showing out of competition .
it focuses on 10 directors , including bernardo bertolucci , catherine breillat , stephen frears , richard linklater , ken loach and david lynch , and what it means to be an artist behind the camera .
it sounds a bit of a luvvie fest but could be insightful ...
thursday 3 september , 1000 local time -lrb- 0900 bst -rrb- the lido is one long strip of land , set apart from mainland venice .
the hotel is at one end and the screenings and events are at the other .
to save my poor feet , which took a pounding on day one , i 've hired a bike - seemingly the only way to get around here .
i love it , but the only problem will be trying to find it again in among the thousands chained to every available static surface .
if you stood still too long someone would try and lock their bike around your leg !
wednesday 2 september , 1950 local time -lrb- 1850 bst -rrb- us actress eva mendes was among the stars to brave the media scrum on opening night the flashbulbs have stopped popping as the stars of the opening film , its director and a host of invited dignitaries take their seats in the impressive sala grande cinema for the premiere of baaria .
ahead of the curtain going up on the film , the festival director marco muller welcomed everyone to the lido for two weeks of non-stop film-watching .
those who will have squarest eyes by the end of the event are the panellists who sit on the jury awarding the prestigious golden lion .
last year 's winner was the wrestler , starring mickey rourke , which went on to achieve mainstream success , and an oscar nomination .
director ang lee is heading this year 's jury , having won the golden lion himself in 2005 for brokeback mountain .
although he says he is excited to be part of the team tasked with picking a winner , he is also apprehensive , saying he considered it somewhat unfair to pit films against each other .
" but it is the parodox that ' we have to go with the flow ' , " he told the assembled audience .
wednesday 2 september , 1630 local time -lrb- 1530 bst -rrb- actress maria grazia cucinotta is the festival 's official ambassador arriving on the opening day of the festival means hitting the ground running in terms of getting your bearings and registering with the many pr companies who set up here for the two weeks of the festival .
this is n't easy when you 've never been to italy before and , sad to say , speak hardly a word of the language .
and it all got off to a bad start when i confidently got on a bus and went the wrong way - for miles .
one bus journey back and a map in hand and it all got a little easier .
the festival opens tonight with baaria , the epic autobiographical film from italian director giuseppe tornatore .
a celebrated figure in italy , his work has transcended his own country , with his 1988 film cinema paradiso a classic feel-good movie on many a movie buff 's must-see recommendation list .
this year festival organisers have opted to go with an italian film to open the festival .
last year brad pitt and george clooney walked the red carpet on opening night to promote burn after reading .
while the premiere of baaria may not garner as many headlines around the world , its exposure at the world 's second biggest film festival has been welcomed in its home country .
and with the beautiful monica bellucci as one of its star names , it should still get some international attention .
wednesday 2 september , 1330 local time -lrb- 1230 bst -rrb- i have arrived in a very hot and sunny venice , having anticipated heavy rain thanks to a slightly off weather forecast .
boarded a water bus bound for the lido , the strip of land where the festival opens today , and the site of many a glamorous tourist holiday .
the public water buses are the equivalent of the old london routemasters , basic and slow , but they really do allow you to take in the breathtaking sights .
the private water taxis whizz by and will probably reach their destination in a quarter of the time .
but as they are at least seven times the price , i 'm happy to just sit back and take in the views .

there are 24 films in competition for the festival 's prestigious golden lion prize - which will be awarded by a jury headed by taiwanese-born director ang lee .
bbc news entertainment reporter keily oakes is spending a brief stint on the lido , filing regular updates on the sights , sounds and stars of the 66th year of the cinematic bonanza .
sunday 6 september , 0910 local time -lrb- 0810 bst -rrb- well it 's my last few hours in venice and the sun is back out shining again .
it has been a great experience being part of such a lively festival .
i have to say that there have n't been many big star names making an appearance here during the opening end of the gala , although i apparently missed paris hilton and mel b traipsing down the red carpet the other night for the bad lieutenant premiere .
obviously neither of them are here to promote movies , i think hilton 's doing some promotion for some jewellery company or other .
i went along to the desert flower party last night and while i was there none of the film 's stars put in appearance , but there was free champagne !
the michael moore screening last night was packed out as the media wanted to get a first look at what he 's been up to since he released sicko several years ago .
he 's uncovered some really fascinating human interest stories about how the economic meltdown has affected middle class america .
but he did n't really offer up any solutions for what could replace the capitalist model he so detests .
there 's still plenty more happening during the final week of the festival , with half of the competition films still to have their premieres .
there is also the first showing of disney pixar 's 3d version of toy story , which will pave the way for toy story 3 which is currently in production .
so i bid farewell to venice as i head for the airport and london , sadly leaving the glitz and glamour of this place to carry on without me .
saturday 5 september , 1900 local time -lrb- 1800 bst -rrb- at an afternoon talk michael moore was once again on his soap box , and this time has in his sights corporate america , blaming it for allowing millions of americans to lose their jobs while the money men were the last to suffer .
he also turned his infamous aggression on the media , failing to understand how newspapers did not see the global meltdown coming .
he considers it the fault of newspapers that there is such a high population of americans that are " functioning illiterates " .
and obviously , george bush gets a lot of stick as well .
whether you agree with his politics or not , he is a fascinating raconteur but there is always that underlying thought that this is a multi-millionaire who has successfully used the system to his financial and artistic advantage .
it is the first press screening of capitalism : a love story , and no doubt there will be some shocking revelations .
saturday 5 september , 1545 local time -lrb- 1445 bst -rrb- at his second press conference in two days werner herzog went into a bit more detail about his latest film to be entered into competition , my son , my son , what have ye done - unfortunately there was no time time to ask him why the dreadful name .
the film , based on the true story of an insane man who kills his mother , went into production after a chat with david lynch about the prohibitive costs involved in movie-making .
they agreed there should be a manifesto that films should be made for under $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.2m -rrb- , and herzog 's took up the idea for this project .
although he said it was shot " guerrilla style " , with peru and china among the settings and willem dafoe and chloe sevigny in the cast , i find it hard to believe they could stick to that budget .
asked how he feels about having two films competing against each other , he said " well venice never accepted any of my films into competition for nearly four decades " .
the weather in venice today has taken a turn for the worse .
it 's windy and cold and definitely cardigan weather , which is unfortunate as it 's my last full day here .
but at least the milder weather might stop so many mosquitoes attacking me .
i 've also had to take my beloved bike back to the hire shop , but i have worked out the buses so wo n't be travelling in the wrong direction again - i hope !
saturday 5 september , 1015 local time -lrb- 0915 bst -rrb- an early morning screening of hong kong film accident , which is showing in competition , saw the audience faced with brutal death from the opening seconds .
the film is about a team of hitmen -lrb- and a woman -rrb- who carry out hits and make them look like bizarre accidents .
although there are moments of extreme gore , it was actually a complex and clever film .
you really had to concentrate on the action to see how the deaths were being set up , or if indeed there were really just accidents .
the surprise entry for the golden lion competition has been announced as my son , my son , what have ye done , from german director werner herzog .
this is his second film in this year 's contest , joining bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans .
and yes it is another terrible title .
my son , my son , what have ye done , stars chloe sevigny , willem defoe and michael shannon , and is billed as " a story of ancient myth and modern madness " .
herzog himself describes it as a horror film without the " blood , chainsaws and gore " , and it all sounds a bit bonkers .
friday 4 september , 2045 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- i finally made it in to venice proper to see some of the historical sights it has to offer .
it is just across the water from the lido where the festival is taking place , but it seems a million miles away in terms of architectural beauty .
that said , it is also swarming with tourists , myself adding to the numbers , and there is a lot of building and restoration work going on around the main attractions , detracting from any feeling of stepping back in time .
but it is still fascinating to walk around the canals that you have seen so many times in films .
many of the streets look like they have been created for a movie set , such is its charm .
tomorrow sees the arrival of some big name stars to the festival , including director george lucas , in town to honour pixar with a lifetime achievement honour , and michael moore , who will be heavily promoting his latest documentary capital : a love story .
no doubt he will have some pretty strong opinions on the present state of the world .
friday 4 september , 1600 local time -lrb- 1500 bst -rrb- i finally met waris dirie and , my goodness , she was one scary lady .
i 'm not sure what i expected , but she turned out to be quite a harsh person - with trust issues .
although i support her campaign against female circumcision and obviously can not understand her personal struggles , her personality makes it difficult to warm to her .
in contrast , the actress that plays her in the film desert flower , liya kebede , was sweet and welcoming , and made me wish she was the real waris that i had been so excited to meet .
friday 4 september , 1430 local time -lrb- 1330 bst -rrb- director yonfan was a lovely man to interview .
but i felt more than a little embarrassed when i politely asked how his english was , to which he modestly replied " so-so " and then launched into a discussion about post-modernism in film .
a press conference for the remake of the bad lieutenant : port of call : new orleans -lrb- terrible name -rrb- saw its stars nicolas cage and eva mendes and director werner herzog face the world 's media .
herzog did n't seem at all embarrassed to admit that he was unfamiliar with the work of the film 's originator abel ferrara - himself exhibiting at the festival , but said they should " get together over a bottle of whiskey " .
cage really likes to talk about " his craft " and spent a great deal of time explaining how he and herzog created his role , right down to how one shoulder should be slightly dipped , and how he was born in los angeles but " reborn in new orleans " .
friday 4 september , 1100 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- went to an early morning screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film depicting a time called " white terror " when suspected pro-communists were rooted out and punished , often by death .
based on a true story , despite its traumatic subject matter it managed to remain upbeat and raise a smile .
later on i 'm interviewing its director yonfan , and have about 10 minutes to research his work .
british actress shirley henderson is being interviewed next to me by a group of journalists .
while the rest of us are sweltering in the late morning heat , the tiny actress arrives in jeans , long-sleeved top , socks and sandals - and carrying a padded coat !
she really does look like a child so its no wonder she 's been cast in the tv film may contain nuts .
based on the book by john o 'farrell , it centres around a mum who is so pushy she decides to sit her daughter 's 11 + exam for her , and nobody notices there 's a grown woman in the exam room .
friday 4 september , 0730 local time -lrb- 0630 bst -rrb- today i 'm excited at the prospect of meeting supermodel waris dirie .
her story of escaping a nomadic life in somalia to becoming a un ambassador speaking out on the subject of female circumcision is truly inspirational .
i saw desert flower before arriving in venice and while it starts out as a feel-good movie , it actually becomes quite harrowing with the depiction of waris 's experiences of circumcision at such a young age .
i 'm glad i did n't see the film out here as i would have jumped on a plane straight home to give my daughter a hug , such was the profound effect the film had on me when i saw it in london .
i have so many questions to ask her about her fascinating life .
firstly though , to a screening of prince of tears , a taiwanese film which i admit to knowing nothing about !
thursday 3 september , 2330 local time -lrb- 2230 bst -rrb- i milled around the red carpet tonight for the premiere of the road .
there are so many premieres going on that they have to share the same red carpet on the same night and this led to a bit of confusion on my part when some impossibly beautiful italian actresses and actors came out .
i still have n't fathomed who they were or what they were promoting but the italian crowd loved them .
viggo mortenson finally made an appearance along with his young australian co-star kodi smit-mcphee .
viggo had a protective arm around his young charge while they were photographed by the 50 or so snappers in the camera pen .
he had earlier gushed about how talented kodi was , calling him mature beyond his years .
" we had a great connection , not just as friends , we became great friends , but also a professional relationship , " he said .
" he is someone who did things every day beyond his years .
i did n't really think of him as a child actor but as someone who was very mature , very quick on his feet , very open-minded .
and also , very important for a shoot like this , he always managed to combine a kid 's urge to have fun and make practical jokes and goof around , with complete focus as an actor . "
unlike usual premieres it was only the top stars who got to walk the red carpet , with other guests ushered round the side , out of view .
harvey weinstein made an appearance , and was obviously not ushered out of sight , and he certainly scrubbed up well in his tuxedo .
unfortunately there were no other stars from the film on display .
no guy pearce , no charlize theron and no omar - i mean michael k williams - making another appearance in a festival film .
the red carpet bit took so long i actually missed the opportunity to get into the screening .
the upside was i got the chance to taste some authentic italian spaghetti instead .
thursday 3 september , 1700 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- just spotted harvey weinstein , the boss of miramax films , wandering about near the excelsior hotel , which is where a lot of wheeling and dealing gets done .
despite being one of the most influential men in independent cinema , and presumably one of the wealthiest , he comes from the simon cowell school of fashion - sporting an unassuming white t-shirt and jeans - but with a phone glued to his ear .
his weinstein company is promoting the road , based on cormac mccarthy 's grim futuristic thriller .

a man has been arrested over the fire which occurred during a party at buckrose court in norton , near malton in north yorkshire .
mr kyne 's aunt said : " the family are devastated and jamie was a star . "
the mother of jockey jan wilson , 19 , said she was waiting for confirmation her daughter was the other victim .
north yorkshire police said they were not in a position to confirm the identities of the victims .
jumped to safety however , friends of jan wilson posted tributes on her bebo webpage .
one wrote : " i am so proud of you for following your dream , you did it , you did become a jockey .
i will never forget you , rest in peace . "
miss wilson of forfar , enjoyed the third adult victory of her career at ayr races just four weeks ago .
following the fire , two other men were taken to hospital .
one of them , apprentice jockey ian brennan , 20 , had jumped to safety from the third floor of the building .

the victims say libya should pay compensation because it supplied the ira with explosives used in atrocities .
mr brown told a victims ' lawyer it was not " appropriate " to discuss the claims , but aides have denied he was trying to protect oil deals with libya .
democratic unionist mp jeffrey donaldson said the pm had done far less for victims than us leaders had .
' strongly opposed ' mr brown 's office released a letter written by the prime minister to ira victims ' lawyer jason mccue last october in which mr brown wrote that the government did not " consider it appropriate to enter into a bilateral discussion with libya on this matter " .
he added that libya would be " strongly opposed to reopening the issue . "
in an earlier letter dating from last september , the prime minister told mr mccue that libya was now an " essential partner " in the fight against terrorism and it was in the uk 's interests for that co-operation to continue .
mr mccue has been lobbying the government to raise the matter of compensation at the highest levels of the libyan government . "
it does make britain look very , very weak and insignificant " colin parry , victim 's father send us your comments his campaign follows out-of-court deals agreed by libya with three american victims of ira atrocities .
more than 100 uk ira victims , who had been pursuing similar claims through the american courts , had been excluded from those deals .
mr donaldson told the bbc that the us government had " held the libyans ' feet to the fire " in order to win a multi-million pound settlement for its nationals .
" i want to know - and the victims are entitled to know - why gordon brown does not have the same desire to stand up for the victims of ira terrorism as george bush showed standing up for american victims , " he said .
" he got a multi-million dollar deal in terms of compensation from the libyans . "
mr donaldson is part of a cross-party group of mps preparing to travel to tripoli for talks about compensation .
the victims ' campaign has been boosted by the scottish government 's decision to free lockerbie bomber abdelbaset ali al-megrahi on compassionate grounds .
the victims argue libya should show similar compassion regarding their demands .
' not about money ' colin parry 's 13-year-old son tim was killed in warrington in 1993 by an ira bomb thought to be made from libyan semtex .
" it does make britain look very , very weak and insignificant if , for reasons of worrying about oil deals or other economic considerations , this government of ours is prepared to disregard all the pain of the thousands of victims of ira terrorist campaigns , " he said .
" it is n't about the money .
it 's about libya saying , ' we now want to be a normal state . '
" if that 's the case then they 've got to address the sins they committed in the past .
the only way they can do that ... is financially - to compensate those people their actions hurt so badly . "
' ever-expanding farce ' " libya are an essential partner in the fight against terrorism and it is in the uk 's interests for this co-operation to continue " gordon brown 's letter to victims ' lawyer full text of pm 's letters a downing street spokesman said the government had raised the issue of compensation with libya informally but it was felt that formal negotiations stood little chance of success .
the conservatives said the public needed to know " on what basis " the government had reached its decision not to press for compensation .
