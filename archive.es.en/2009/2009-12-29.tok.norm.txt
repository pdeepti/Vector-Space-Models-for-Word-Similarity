for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .
" with every blast , it gets sort of beefed up even more .
and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 29.12.2009 beautiful art from " the most dangerous place in the world " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " new clothes for the emperor " by pakistani artist naiza khan amidst all the bomb blasts and fighting in the country , pakistan 's art scene continues to thrive - and it is getting more attention on an international level : new york 's asia society exhibition called " hanging fire : contemporary art from pakistan " has displayed 55 works from 15 pakistani artists since september 10 and will continue through to january 3 .
for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .
" with every blast , it gets sort of beefed up even more .
and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .

the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .

the girl 's brother was also sentenced for his role in carrying out the brutal murder with the help of an accomplice . gulsum was murdered , a german court in kleve found , because she was no longer a virgin .
judges said the young woman 's lifestyle was seen as an affront to the family honor .
the victim 's father , who had moved the family from turkey to germany 15 years ago , reportedly began plotting along with his son to kill gulsum after finding out that the young woman was no longer a virgin and had undergone an abortion .
gulsum had apparently turned to german social workers for help , fearing what her family might do .
arrangements were made for her to live in an apartment .
but she eventually returned to live at home .
" gulsum became the victim of a terrible crime , " head judge christian henkel said after the verdict .
" this was the act of father and son , who both wished it and planned it . "
the court sentenced gulsum 's 20-year-old brother to nine-and-a-half years in prison .
the brother allegedly lured gulsum to get into a car with him before picking up a friend of his .
the two men then drove gulsum to a secluded spot near their western german home close to the dutch border , choked her with a rope and clubbed her to death .
more than 50 honor killings in germany in past decade the court expressed shock at the violent nature of the murder . " this is a horrible act with a horrible outcome , " henkel said .
the accomplice , 37 , was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the crime .

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .
" let the americans hand over all their information on missile defense , and we 'll be ready to hand over all the information on offensive weapons systems , " said putin. mrh / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

this is the first time a european has been executed in china in 50 years . akmal shaikh , 53 , was executed on tuesday , bringing to a close a legal and diplomatic dispute that has strained relations between china and the united kingdom . british prime minister gordon brown said in a statement : “ i condemn the execution of akmal shaikh in the strongest of terms , and i am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted . ” britain , the european union , and international human rights groups had called for clemency for shaikh since he was given the death sentence in december 2008 . “ i am particularly concerned , ” said brown , “ that no mental health assessment was undertaken . ” troubled man shaikh 's family had cited his history of mental illness in their appeals , saying his condition had worsened in recent years .
the father of three from london had become estranged from his family - when they had last had regular contact with him , in 2007 , he was living on the street in poland . however , china 's official xinhua news agency reported that the court said evidence provided by the british was not enough . " the materials provided by the british side were insufficient in proving that akmal has a mental illness and that akmal 's family has a history of mental illness .
akmal himself also did not provide such materials , " said the court 's report . shaikh , who is said to have suffered from bipolar disorder , was arrested in september 2007 at urumqi airport in xinjiang province with four kilograms of heroin in his suitcase .
his family says he was tricked by drug smugglers , who promised they would help him become a pop star .
relatives say shaikh was unaware his luggage contained drugs . according to reprieve , the british legal defense foundation that took the lead in publicizing shaikh 's case , the last time a european was executed in china was in 1951 . italian antonio riva was put to death for his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate mao zedong . mh / mk / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 29.12.2009 2009 not a good year for wildlife preservation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numbers of tigers in the wild fell dramatically this year , according to the wwf while some species are seeing a chance of new beginnings , the world wide fund for nature is giving a poor report card on halting biodiversity loss for 2009 . among the world 's endangered species , tigers , rhinoceroses , and polar bears had the worst year in 2009 according to the world wide fund for nature .
however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

the tournament brings together the world 's best alpine ski jumpers , who compete at four sites in germany and austria . austria 's olympic silver medalist andreas kofler out-jumped the competition on the opening day of the four hills tournament , racking up 265.2 points .
the german team had hoped for a strong showing in oberstdorf .

martin schmitt , also a potential medal contender , placed 23rd .
" it 's true that my jumps were n't so bad .
but it 's only possible to be really happy when one wins , " bodmer said .
the 19 year-old is seen as an up-and-comer on the german team .

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .

the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .
" with every blast , it gets sort of beefed up even more .
and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .
" with every blast , it gets sort of beefed up even more .
and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .

i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

the girl 's brother was also sentenced for his role in carrying out the brutal murder with the help of an accomplice . gulsum was murdered , a german court in kleve found , because she was no longer a virgin .
judges said the young woman 's lifestyle was seen as an affront to the family honor .
the victim 's father , who had moved the family from turkey to germany 15 years ago , reportedly began plotting along with his son to kill gulsum after finding out that the young woman was no longer a virgin and had undergone an abortion .
gulsum had apparently turned to german social workers for help , fearing what her family might do .
arrangements were made for her to live in an apartment .
but she eventually returned to live at home .
" gulsum became the victim of a terrible crime , " head judge christian henkel said after the verdict .
" this was the act of father and son , who both wished it and planned it . "
the court sentenced gulsum 's 20-year-old brother to nine-and-a-half years in prison .
the brother allegedly lured gulsum to get into a car with him before picking up a friend of his .
the two men then drove gulsum to a secluded spot near their western german home close to the dutch border , choked her with a rope and clubbed her to death .
more than 50 honor killings in germany in past decade the court expressed shock at the violent nature of the murder . " this is a horrible act with a horrible outcome , " henkel said .
the accomplice , 37 , was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the crime .
german authorities have vowed to crack down on so-called " honor killings " by kurds , turks and other ethnic groups .
german authorities say there have been 55 honor killings over the last nine years. th / dpa / ap / apd / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .

the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .
" let the americans hand over all their information on missile defense , and we 'll be ready to hand over all the information on offensive weapons systems , " said putin. mrh / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .
" let the americans hand over all their information on missile defense , and we 'll be ready to hand over all the information on offensive weapons systems , " said putin. mrh / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .
" let the americans hand over all their information on missile defense , and we 'll be ready to hand over all the information on offensive weapons systems , " said putin. mrh / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2009 body scanners : what lies beneath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old fashioned metal detectors might not be good enough for the future more airports are considering using body scanning techniques to find and deter threats to commercial air travel .
some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .
" with every blast , it gets sort of beefed up even more .
and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2009 body scanners : what lies beneath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old fashioned metal detectors might not be good enough for the future more airports are considering using body scanning techniques to find and deter threats to commercial air travel .
some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2009 body scanners : what lies beneath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old fashioned metal detectors might not be good enough for the future more airports are considering using body scanning techniques to find and deter threats to commercial air travel .
some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

this is the first time a european has been executed in china in 50 years . akmal shaikh , 53 , was executed on tuesday , bringing to a close a legal and diplomatic dispute that has strained relations between china and the united kingdom . british prime minister gordon brown said in a statement : “ i condemn the execution of akmal shaikh in the strongest of terms , and i am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted . ” britain , the european union , and international human rights groups had called for clemency for shaikh since he was given the death sentence in december 2008 . “ i am particularly concerned , ” said brown , “ that no mental health assessment was undertaken . ” troubled man shaikh 's family had cited his history of mental illness in their appeals , saying his condition had worsened in recent years .
the father of three from london had become estranged from his family - when they had last had regular contact with him , in 2007 , he was living on the street in poland . however , china 's official xinhua news agency reported that the court said evidence provided by the british was not enough . " the materials provided by the british side were insufficient in proving that akmal has a mental illness and that akmal 's family has a history of mental illness .
akmal himself also did not provide such materials , " said the court 's report . shaikh , who is said to have suffered from bipolar disorder , was arrested in september 2007 at urumqi airport in xinjiang province with four kilograms of heroin in his suitcase .
his family says he was tricked by drug smugglers , who promised they would help him become a pop star .
relatives say shaikh was unaware his luggage contained drugs . according to reprieve , the british legal defense foundation that took the lead in publicizing shaikh 's case , the last time a european was executed in china was in 1951 . italian antonio riva was put to death for his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate mao zedong . mh / mk / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .

at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .
" let the americans hand over all their information on missile defense , and we 'll be ready to hand over all the information on offensive weapons systems , " said putin. mrh / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .

the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 29.12.2009 2009 not a good year for wildlife preservation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numbers of tigers in the wild fell dramatically this year , according to the wwf while some species are seeing a chance of new beginnings , the world wide fund for nature is giving a poor report card on halting biodiversity loss for 2009 . among the world 's endangered species , tigers , rhinoceroses , and polar bears had the worst year in 2009 according to the world wide fund for nature .
however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .
" with every blast , it gets sort of beefed up even more .
and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .
" with every blast , it gets sort of beefed up even more .
and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "

" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .

therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .

therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 29.12.2009 2009 not a good year for wildlife preservation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numbers of tigers in the wild fell dramatically this year , according to the wwf while some species are seeing a chance of new beginnings , the world wide fund for nature is giving a poor report card on halting biodiversity loss for 2009 . among the world 's endangered species , tigers , rhinoceroses , and polar bears had the worst year in 2009 according to the world wide fund for nature .
however , the elbe beaver , lynx and amur leopard may have a slightly more promising future , the wwf said in frankfurt on tuesday .
the organization criticized the progressive destruction of animal habitats by a combined process of climate change , increased poaching and over-exploitation by humans .
" there were a few silver linings , but the mass extinction of animals and plants persisted unabated in 2009 , " said chris dickinson , head of species conservation at wwf germany .
as a result , he said , the federal government had missed its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
according to wwf estimates , only about 3,200 tigers still exist in the wild worldwide , and the south china tiger might even be extinct thanks to poaching and the demand for illegal tiger products in traditional asian medicine .
gone forever it is too late , according to the wwf , for the kihansi spray toad in tanzania which became extinct after a new dam destroyed its habitat and a fungus wiped out the rest of the species .
also , approximately 1,900 of a total of about 6,300 different species of amphibians have been classified as highly endangered .
at particular risk , according to the wwf , are polar bears .
large areas of the arctic will be polar bear-free by 2050 .
climate change is altering the ecosystem of polar bears at such a rapid pace that the animals can not adapt quickly enough , the organization said .
also in dire peril are the annamese rhinos in vietnam : only eight animals still exist , the wwf believes . and these are acutely threatened by new roads near the cat tien national park .
silver lining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lynxes are back in the bavarian forest after 100 years in german forests , however , there has been some good news .
the lynx has carved out new habitats in the bavarian forest and the harz region after 100 years of absence , the wwf says . in addition , the elbe beaver found a home in the wetlands along the banks of the elbe river , thanks to one of the largest dike-building projects in europe .
the project managed to increase the beaver 's habitat in the wetlands along the river while also reducing the risk of flooding for residents in the area thanks to the widened wetland zone .
the third partial success story this year was the amur leopard , which is native to eastern russia .
there are an estimated 35 of the big cats in the wild .

this is the first time a european has been executed in china in 50 years . akmal shaikh , 53 , was executed on tuesday , bringing to a close a legal and diplomatic dispute that has strained relations between china and the united kingdom . british prime minister gordon brown said in a statement : “ i condemn the execution of akmal shaikh in the strongest of terms , and i am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted . ” britain , the european union , and international human rights groups had called for clemency for shaikh since he was given the death sentence in december 2008 . “ i am particularly concerned , ” said brown , “ that no mental health assessment was undertaken . ” troubled man shaikh 's family had cited his history of mental illness in their appeals , saying his condition had worsened in recent years .
the father of three from london had become estranged from his family - when they had last had regular contact with him , in 2007 , he was living on the street in poland . however , china 's official xinhua news agency reported that the court said evidence provided by the british was not enough . " the materials provided by the british side were insufficient in proving that akmal has a mental illness and that akmal 's family has a history of mental illness .
akmal himself also did not provide such materials , " said the court 's report . shaikh , who is said to have suffered from bipolar disorder , was arrested in september 2007 at urumqi airport in xinjiang province with four kilograms of heroin in his suitcase .
his family says he was tricked by drug smugglers , who promised they would help him become a pop star .
relatives say shaikh was unaware his luggage contained drugs . according to reprieve , the british legal defense foundation that took the lead in publicizing shaikh 's case , the last time a european was executed in china was in 1951 . italian antonio riva was put to death for his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate mao zedong . mh / mk / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the problem is that our american partners are building a missile shield and we are not building one , ” said putin .
he added that the shield could fundamentally change the military relationship between the two nations .
“ there is a danger that our partners , by creating such ‘ an umbrella , ' will feel completely secure and thus can allow themselves to do what they want , disrupting the balance , and aggressiveness will rise immediately . ”
talks ongoing russian and us officials have been holding talks in geneva on a successor to the start i treaty which set limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals .
the two sides had hoped to sign a deal before the old one 's original expiration date , december 5th , but they have had to sign a temporary extension .
reports from the talks , as well as recent comments made by russian president dimitri medvedev and his us counterpart , barack obama , after a meeting on the sidelines of the copenhagen climate summit , have suggested a deal is close .
but putin 's remarks may signal a last-minute hardening of russia 's position on the missile shield issue - one which some believed had been addressed .
in september , obama told russia that it would discontinue a plan initiated by the bush administration to build components of a missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
obama did say , however , that the us would keep researching other methods and locations for the shield which washington says is meant to defend against attacks from rogue nations .
russia , however , still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it now pledges to counter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.12.2009 opinion : iranian demonstrators wo n't simply go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent protests in iran have been the bloodiest in months .
but despite many arrests and even deaths , the protest movement is n't likely to give up soon , says dw 's peter philipp . six months after the country 's controversial presidential election , protests in iran have yet to let up .
in fact , they 've been increasing in intensity .
the most recent clashes in tehran and other parts of the country were the most intense in months , and the iranian government no longer denies the fact that in the latest round of demonstrations , protesters were shot .
the victims included the 41-year-old nephew of opposition leader and former presidential candidate mir-hossein mousavi .
the extent of property damage and the number of protesters who were injured or taken into custody is difficult to pin down .
strict censoring measures in place in iran hinder the flow of information , but scenes of destroyed and burned-out cars , motorcycles and stores shown on iranian state television after the protests are signs that the conflict in iran has become increasingly violent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp but that does n't mean that the escalation is necessarily going to continue until it leads to an explosion .
rather , it is repeatedly external circumstances that encourage the protest movement to take to the streets again , which in turn leads authorities to react drastically .
the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

the current provocation was without a doubt ashura , a shiite holy day marking the violent death of hussein , the grandson of the prophet mohammad .
the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

the raw emotions on display during shiite 's highest day of mourning mingled this time with thoughts of the recently deceased grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri , one of the architects of the islamic revolution who become one of the spiritual supporters of the protests in 2009 .
the religious-traditional core of the protest movement defines itself as the rightful heir of these two figures and gathers strength from them to launch new demonstrations . some demonstrators take things further and call for the abolishment of the islamic republic altogether , while others are possibly in the service of foreign powers whose goal is to destabilize the regime in tehran .
the latter , if they do exist , are certainly in the minority , and the iranian authorities know that as well .
although drastic measures have been taken , such as the arrest and trial of protesters , the government is so far avoiding a major confrontation .
they have not detained the figurehead of the movement , mousavi , and they are clearly reluctant to allow a fissure in the population to develop .
one of the main reasons for this approach is the fact that the authorities in tehran have , of course , known for some time that the dissatisfaction extends to the broader population and is not restricted to the protesters .
but apparently they do n't know how they can gain control of the situation . every new clash poisons the atmosphere further - and it is perhaps already too late to heed the advice of parliamentary speaker ali larijani who says the grievances of the protesters need to be discussed .
but it will be people like larijani - themselves members of the political and religious establishment - who could help put iran back on track .
larijani is known for his aversion toward president mahmoud ahmadinejad , and people like him could take it upon themselves to correct the misguided development of the islamic republic and rescue the 30-year-old system .
but they should n't wait much longer : the wheels are in motion , and the situation could soon spin out of control .

some find the practice to be invasive and are raising issues of privacy infringement . last week 's attempted airline terror attack by nigerian abdul farouk abdulmutallab has renewed discussion about controversial airport security measures like full-body or " nude " scanners .
some airports in the us , amsterdam , zurich and london have already begun using the scanners , which quickly generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
security personnel who use the scanners are able to discern many features of scanned individuals ' bodies .
but security experts and scanner manufacturers have sought to quell related privacy concerns in several ways .
some scanners blur the head of each scanned individual or obscure the individual 's genitals .
also , the scanning procedure can be arranged so that the machine operators do not see the images of the people they scan .
in that case , the images produced can be analyzed by staff members in an isolated room elsewhere in the airport , who then notify workers at the terminals if a problem appears .
germany 's federal police force handles security at the nation 's airports and has taken another approach to privacy concerns .
" we have been experimenting with the scanners to see how effective it is to generate silhouettes rather than reproducing most features of an individual 's body .
in that case , security personnel would just be able to see an outline of the body as well as anything hidden on it , " joerg kunzendorf , a spokesman for the german federal police , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : body scanners like those at schiphol airport can see what is beneath the subject 's clothes the federal police force in germany has been working with a type of body scanner known as a millimeter wave scanner .
this operates by emitting millimeter waves , which are situated between radio waves and infrared waves on the spectral scale .
millimeter waves are able to render lightweight layers like clothing transparent while reflecting the human body and concealed explosives , weapons and other objects .
a transceiver collects the reflected signals and forwards them to a computer for processing .
there , a 3-d image of the scanned individual is generated , according to a document released by the us department of energy .
another type of body scanner known as a backscatter x-ray has also been developed by american science and engineering -lrb- as & e -rrb- in the us .
the backscatter scanner works by emitting high energy rays that scatter upon coming into contact with materials rather than penetrating them like in a medical x-ray .
the machine detects these scattered x-rays and is able to use them to render images of items that are low in atomic number .
product information on the as & e website states that these low atomic materials include plastic weapons and explosives .
the backscatter system is also able to detect metal weapons or devices used to detonate bombs .
such materials do not produce a backscatter effect , and the scanner is able to recognize them by noting scanned regions where this effect does not occur. gsw / afp / dpa editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "

and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "
a flourishing art scene amidst political unrest huma mulji is a pakistani artist .
our interview with her had to be postponed over two hours because of a check point set up due to a bomb blast the previous day .

and so for two or three days after that , there are several checkpoints that you have to cross before getting home . "
but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
and that now , especially , pakistani artists living abroad are torn between two worlds .

for this story , sarah berning talked with the director of the asia society museum and with four pakistani artists participating there . melissa chiu , director of the asia society museum in new york , says in contrast to most people ’ s assumptions about pakistan , there is a lively , vibrant contemporary art scene .
she says " hanging fire " is " an exhibition that really was designed to provide a glimpse of what artistic practice might be in a place that was declared as one of the ' most dangerous places in the world ' by president obama . "

but huma mulji is also very positive about the state of pakistani art , " it is a very exciting time for pakistani contemporary art in particular because now contemporary art for the first time is being accepted . "
increase in demand in pakistani art bani abidi , a pakistani artist living in india , says the increase in interest in pakistani art is partly due to the increase in interest in the country 's current political situation .
but she also says it is in part because there is simply more art , now that more and more artists are able to concentrate exclusively on their art .
" i think the art scene has taken off in terms of international visibility .
and that is because it is a trend internationally to be focusing on chinese art and indian art and middle eastern art .
therefore the visibility of art and of artists producing in this region have increased .
but it is a different kind of art scene , which sort of has a more international language . "
pakistan 's free space of expression naiza khan , another artist whose works are on display in new york , says the changes in the pakistani art scene are not only changes in perception internationally .
she says artists are undergoing changes in their self-perception , as they feel their voice has become louder within the the last 10 years .
" it 's not just the content of the actual work , but is also the way some of the medium is used .
and i think the lack of state control is also very visible as well .
and that is also very interesting because our press , our media , which is ferociously free , maintains its independence from the state .
i think in the same way , not necessarily with the same impact , but certainly with the same aspirations , artists have also fought for this free space of expression . "
hamra abbas , a pakistani artist currently living in the united states , points out the difficulties the pakistani people are going through .
she asks the media not to generalise the situation going on in pakistan , but says that artists , wherever they are , are affected by the things going on around them .
