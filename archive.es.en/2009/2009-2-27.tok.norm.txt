27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "

yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .

" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .

the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "

" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .

williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "

human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "

it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .

human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de illiteracy closely tied to unemployment , expert says as the world observes international literacy day on monday , germany announced a program to teach the six percent of illiterate germans over the age of 15 how to read and write .
-lrb- 08.09.2008 -rrb- illiteracy still a problem in europe , report says nine million europeans ca n't read or write , according to a recent united nations report .
low levels of literacy are not confined to the fringes of european society , the report said .

but immigrant groups panned the country 's recent integration efforts .

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .

according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .

ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .

german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "

detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 27.02.2009 vatican demands full apology from holocaust-denying bishop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson returned to britain this week after being expelled from argentina the vatican said on friday it was not satisfied by the apology issued by holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson and called on him to " unequivocally and publicly " withdraw his comments . british-born bishop richard williamson , whose denial of the scale of the holocaust caused an international outcry , apologized this week for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous . the vatican said on friday , feb .
27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 27.02.2009 vatican demands full apology from holocaust-denying bishop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson returned to britain this week after being expelled from argentina the vatican said on friday it was not satisfied by the apology issued by holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson and called on him to " unequivocally and publicly " withdraw his comments . british-born bishop richard williamson , whose denial of the scale of the holocaust caused an international outcry , apologized this week for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous . the vatican said on friday , feb .
27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .

eib president philippe maystadt said : " this joint action plan will help speed up the delivery of vital finance through the banks to support the real economy of hard-hit countries in central , eastern and southern europe , and particularly to help small businesses survive in these turbulent times . "
eastern european " credit crunch " ebrd president thomas mirow said friday that a number of eastern european banks were at serious risk of failing .
" our plan must be implemented as quickly as possible or there will be a credit crunch in eastern europe , that is , insufficient financing for enterprises , households and foreign trade , " he said .
" in the current crisis , numerous banks need state support via national rescue plans as well as our aid . "
the ebrd head said that at least 10 major western european banks were deeply involved in central and eastern europe , adding that " if their branch banks fail in the east it will almost certainly have an impact on the euro zone . "
western european countries most vulnerable to a collapse of the eastern european banking system are france , greece , italy , austria , sweden and germany , mirow said .
the ebrd was set up in 1991 to help former soviet republics shift to market economies . -lrb- dfm / sp / afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .

never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de illiteracy closely tied to unemployment , expert says as the world observes international literacy day on monday , germany announced a program to teach the six percent of illiterate germans over the age of 15 how to read and write .
-lrb- 08.09.2008 -rrb- illiteracy still a problem in europe , report says nine million europeans ca n't read or write , according to a recent united nations report .
low levels of literacy are not confined to the fringes of european society , the report said .
-lrb- 07.05.2008 -rrb- berlin promises better education chances for immigrants by 2012 , all first-graders , even those with an immigration background , should have a good command of german , berlin promised .
but immigrant groups panned the country 's recent integration efforts .

human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted .

human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .

ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .

demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .

according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this initiative complements national crisis responses and will deploy rapid , large-scale and coordinated financial assistance from the international financial institutions to support lending to the real economy through private banking groups , in particular to small- and medium-sized enterprises , " the statement said .
" the response takes into account the different macroeconomic circumstances in and financial pressures on countries in eastern europe , acknowledging the diversity of challenges stemming from the global financial retrenchment . "
central and eastern european states such as poland , hungary , latvia and the czech republic have been hit especially hard by the financial crisis .
the ebrd will provide up to six billion euros for debt , equity and trade financing for banks and businesses , the eib is to provide 11 billion euros of lending facilities , while the world bank will provide additional support worth around 7.5 billion euros , the statement from the institutions said .
european unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert zoellick says europe must come together to help eastern europe world bank president robert zoellick said friday that a coordinated european effort was needed to help central and eastern europe and ensure the " achievements of the last 20 years are not lost because of an economic crisis that is rapidly turning into a human crisis .
" i welcome the close cooperation among the ebrd , the eib and the world bank group , and am committed to making this partnership work as we move forward to address the risk of a crisis of the banking sector in eastern europe , " he said .
eib president philippe maystadt said : " this joint action plan will help speed up the delivery of vital finance through the banks to support the real economy of hard-hit countries in central , eastern and southern europe , and particularly to help small businesses survive in these turbulent times . "
eastern european " credit crunch " ebrd president thomas mirow said friday that a number of eastern european banks were at serious risk of failing .

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .

it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .

" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "

williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.02.2009 opel moves to break away from general motors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be the end of an 80-year partnership if the two carmakers opt to go seperate ways the head of general motors europe , carl-peter forster , said on friday that opel would become a semi-independent company , adding that the stricken german carmaker needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . forster , said on friday that the us company envisioned opel becoming an " at least partly an independent business unit . "
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de illiteracy closely tied to unemployment , expert says as the world observes international literacy day on monday , germany announced a program to teach the six percent of illiterate germans over the age of 15 how to read and write .
-lrb- 08.09.2008 -rrb- illiteracy still a problem in europe , report says nine million europeans ca n't read or write , according to a recent united nations report .
low levels of literacy are not confined to the fringes of european society , the report said .
-lrb- 07.05.2008 -rrb- berlin promises better education chances for immigrants by 2012 , all first-graders , even those with an immigration background , should have a good command of german , berlin promised .
but immigrant groups panned the country 's recent integration efforts .

european unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert zoellick says europe must come together to help eastern europe world bank president robert zoellick said friday that a coordinated european effort was needed to help central and eastern europe and ensure the " achievements of the last 20 years are not lost because of an economic crisis that is rapidly turning into a human crisis .
" i welcome the close cooperation among the ebrd , the eib and the world bank group , and am committed to making this partnership work as we move forward to address the risk of a crisis of the banking sector in eastern europe , " he said .
eib president philippe maystadt said : " this joint action plan will help speed up the delivery of vital finance through the banks to support the real economy of hard-hit countries in central , eastern and southern europe , and particularly to help small businesses survive in these turbulent times . "
eastern european " credit crunch " ebrd president thomas mirow said friday that a number of eastern european banks were at serious risk of failing .
" our plan must be implemented as quickly as possible or there will be a credit crunch in eastern europe , that is , insufficient financing for enterprises , households and foreign trade , " he said .
" in the current crisis , numerous banks need state support via national rescue plans as well as our aid . "
the ebrd head said that at least 10 major western european banks were deeply involved in central and eastern europe , adding that " if their branch banks fail in the east it will almost certainly have an impact on the euro zone . "
western european countries most vulnerable to a collapse of the eastern european banking system are france , greece , italy , austria , sweden and germany , mirow said .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .

ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.02.2009 opel moves to break away from general motors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be the end of an 80-year partnership if the two carmakers opt to go seperate ways the head of general motors europe , carl-peter forster , said on friday that opel would become a semi-independent company , adding that the stricken german carmaker needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . forster , said on friday that the us company envisioned opel becoming an " at least partly an independent business unit . "
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .

according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .

ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

england 's aston villa also failed to progress beyond the round of 32 . bremen have been struggling in the bundesliga this season and looked to be on their way out of the uefa cup when an andrea pirlo penalty and a goal from brazilian young-gun pato gave the rossoneri a 2-0 lead at the break .
however , a second-half double from peru international pizarro stunned the home crowd at the san siro and levelled the tie at 3-3 on aggregate with bremen progressing on the away goals rule .
the away goals rule means that the team which scores the most goals away from home in a two-leg tie will win in the case that both teams have scored an equal amount of goals over the two games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.02.2009 opel moves to break away from general motors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be the end of an 80-year partnership if the two carmakers opt to go seperate ways the head of general motors europe , carl-peter forster , said on friday that opel would become a semi-independent company , adding that the stricken german carmaker needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . forster , said on friday that the us company envisioned opel becoming an " at least partly an independent business unit . "
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .

according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .

ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .

gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.02.2009 guantanamo issue looms large for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe says it still needs more information about the detainees the european union has put the issue of whether to accept former guantanamo inmates at the top of its agenda .
human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted .

human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted . " i 'm afraid this is only the tip of the renditions iceberg , " clara gutteridge , an investigator with reprieve , told reuters thursday . th / jen / afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .

"
eastern european " credit crunch " ebrd president thomas mirow said friday that a number of eastern european banks were at serious risk of failing .
" our plan must be implemented as quickly as possible or there will be a credit crunch in eastern europe , that is , insufficient financing for enterprises , households and foreign trade , " he said .
" in the current crisis , numerous banks need state support via national rescue plans as well as our aid . "
the ebrd head said that at least 10 major western european banks were deeply involved in central and eastern europe , adding that " if their branch banks fail in the east it will almost certainly have an impact on the euro zone . "

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .

never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .

ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .
communication skills needed but the court in mannheim agreed that it was not enough to speak the language - citizenship applicants must at least be able to read german .
only then can written forms in his or her name can be checked for accuracy , said the judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants can catch up on language skills in night school , the court said in order to integrate socially and politically , the man was told , it is necessary to be able to follow the media and be able to communicate with germans .
other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .
germany has a literacy rate of nearly 100 percent ; according to the education nonprofit dvv international , there are an estimated four million illiterates in the country . jp / jen / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de illiteracy closely tied to unemployment , expert says as the world observes international literacy day on monday , germany announced a program to teach the six percent of illiterate germans over the age of 15 how to read and write .
-lrb- 08.09.2008 -rrb- illiteracy still a problem in europe , report says nine million europeans ca n't read or write , according to a recent united nations report .
low levels of literacy are not confined to the fringes of european society , the report said .
-lrb- 07.05.2008 -rrb- berlin promises better education chances for immigrants by 2012 , all first-graders , even those with an immigration background , should have a good command of german , berlin promised .
but immigrant groups panned the country 's recent integration efforts .

although the 39-year-old man was granted asylum by the german state in 1993 and has been granted permanent residency in germany , he turned to the higher administrative court in baden-wuerttemberg when his application for citizenship was denied by the city of pforzheim on the grounds of an insufficient knowledge of german .

other signs of successful integration , such as a secure job and well-integrated children , could not compensate for illiteracy , the court said .
never too late even though the man has no formal education and can not read or write , the court ruled that even a foreigner who is illiterate in their own language can not be exempted from the german citizenship stipulations .
the man was also told that since he was only 19 when he first arrived in germany , he should have taken the opportunity to enroll in literacy classes - and that it was still not too late to learn to read and write .

" this initiative complements national crisis responses and will deploy rapid , large-scale and coordinated financial assistance from the international financial institutions to support lending to the real economy through private banking groups , in particular to small- and medium-sized enterprises , " the statement said .
" the response takes into account the different macroeconomic circumstances in and financial pressures on countries in eastern europe , acknowledging the diversity of challenges stemming from the global financial retrenchment . "
central and eastern european states such as poland , hungary , latvia and the czech republic have been hit especially hard by the financial crisis .

" i welcome the close cooperation among the ebrd , the eib and the world bank group , and am committed to making this partnership work as we move forward to address the risk of a crisis of the banking sector in eastern europe , " he said .
eib president philippe maystadt said : " this joint action plan will help speed up the delivery of vital finance through the banks to support the real economy of hard-hit countries in central , eastern and southern europe , and particularly to help small businesses survive in these turbulent times . "
eastern european " credit crunch " ebrd president thomas mirow said friday that a number of eastern european banks were at serious risk of failing .
" our plan must be implemented as quickly as possible or there will be a credit crunch in eastern europe , that is , insufficient financing for enterprises , households and foreign trade , " he said .
" in the current crisis , numerous banks need state support via national rescue plans as well as our aid . "
the ebrd head said that at least 10 major western european banks were deeply involved in central and eastern europe , adding that " if their branch banks fail in the east it will almost certainly have an impact on the euro zone . "
western european countries most vulnerable to a collapse of the eastern european banking system are france , greece , italy , austria , sweden and germany , mirow said .

"
he also confirmed that opel needed 3.3 billion euros to to help it through the current downturn in the car market .
he made the comments at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim after presenting its board with a plan to save the german car maker .
forster said gm europe would present the plan to german authorities on monday .
earlier on friday , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that the degree of integration between opel and the detroit-based gm would make opel 's push to part company with its troubled us parent very difficult .
instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .

according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .

guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , the economics minister called on gm to produce a viable business plan for opel . berlin said friday that the battle for opel and its european operations would be raised at a european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit set down for sunday . thousands of opel workers took to the streets across europe thursday to demonstrate to save their jobs after parent company gm announced moves for a major shakeout in its international operations amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry . in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection . rumors citing sources close to the german government , financial times deutschland reported friday , feb .
27 that opel 's plant in the city of eisenach might go to mercedes-parent daimler .
according to the report , the fate of another opel factory in the western city of bochum is still uncertain , while two more plants in ruesselsheim and kaiserslautern would remain part of opel after it is spun off from its floundering us parent , general motors .
however , speaking on german public broadcaster zdf on friday morning , the state premier of north rhine westphalia , juergen ruettgers , denied the rumors and ruled out a sale to the luxury car maker .
" i can not imagine any scenario based on the closure of any plants , " he insisted .
state guarantees could be an option to help opel implement a new business plan , he stressed .
" the state can make sure that opel has a chance to implement this concept .
guarantees are one option , which we 're not only using in the car industry , " he said .
the options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is gm 's eisenach plant " zu verkaufen " - for sale ?
ruettgers was likely referring to a restructuring plan to be presented in a meeting in ruesselsheim of the opel supervisory board later on friday .
the plan is believed to be based on the company 's separation from parent gm , which faces massive financial problems .
this condition has been set by german federal and state governments for extending public aid to opel , fearing that funding could otherwise end up in us coffers .
demonstrations on thursday , thousands of opel workers demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in ruesselsheim , demanding that gm scrap plans for plant closures in europe and calling for opel 's independence from its detroit parent .
the global financial crisis has brought gm 's european brands to their knees .
opel , 152 years old , with 25,000 workers and once briefly germany 's biggest carmaker , has been badly hit by dwindling demand and troubles in detroit .
gm said thursday that its european division had pretax losses of $ 2.8 billion in 2008 .
it has said $ 1.2 billion of costs need to be cut in europe , where it operates opel , saab and vauxhall in britain .
government split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : european plants could not be " thrown away like a squeezed lemon " german vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier pledged his support at the rally but stopped short of offering any guarantees .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " he said , but added that he opposed every form of protectionism .
" do not listen to the sweet poison of the separatists , they are the gravediggers of employment , " he warned .
" opel needs open markets , too . "
german leaders are split on how far the government should go to rescue opel , with some politicians arguing the carmaker should be left to fend for itself .
chancellor angela merkel told a news conference in berlin this week that she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid . jp / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , that this is not enough to admit him into the church as a clergyman . vatican spokesman federico lombardi said williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set by the vatican on february 4 , under which the bishop was to " distance himself absolutely and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wants to be admitted as a prelate in the church . no retraction offered williamson , 68 , found himself at the center of a raging controversy after he told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
williamson also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million .
in his apology , williamson said his views on the holocaust were " the opinion of a non-historian , " and had been formed " 20 years ago on the basis of evidence then available , " according to zenit .
he did not say whether he had changed his views .
legal repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has called williamson 's views " unacceptable " williamson might also face legal action in many european nations if he repeats his claims , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot warned friday . however the bishop remains free to move around the 27-nation european union despite denying that jews were killed in gas chambers . " i want to point out that in most -lrb- eu -rrb- states , holocaust-denial can lead to legal action .
national justice systems have jurisdiction to deal with historical revisionism , " barrot said . " if bishop williamson were to repeat his negationist remarks in france , he could be punished under french law , " barrot said on the sidelines of a meeting of eu justice ministers in brussels . reactions and outrage renzo gattegna , the president of italy 's jewish communities , described williamson 's apology as " absolutely ambiguous , " reported british daily the guardian .
the central council of jews in germany , meanwhile , described it as " a third-rate apology . "
" williamson is not withdrawing his lies about the holocaust , " said vice-president dieter gramm in an interview with handelsblatt .
" his utterly bizarre explanation does not include any retraction , in fact it suggests that he still denies it happened . "
this issue is by no means closed , he insisted .
" it is more relevant than ever . "
hans joachim meyer , vice-president of the central council of catholics in germany , agreed . the apology was by no means " sufficient , " he stressed . " a man like this should not be in a position of responsibility , " he told the tagesspiegel .
williamson back in britain adding to the controversy was the fact that williamson was one of four bishops whose excommunication pope benedict xvi agreed in january to lift , in an attempt by the vatican to heal a split with traditionalist roman catholics who rejected the church 's liberal reforms of the early 1960s .
the vatican said earlier the bishop 's views on the holocaust were not known to the pope when he made the decision .
pope benedict xvi had responded to the widespread outrage over williamson 's comments by calling holocaust denial " intolerable " and " unacceptable . "
williamson spent most of the past three decades in switzerland and the united states before heading to a seminary in buenos aires .
after the controversy broke , he was expelled from argentina and is now in britain . th / jp -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

human rights groups say europe also needs to shoulder some of the blame for what has happened . when us secretary of state hillary clinton travels to meet with top european officials in brussels next week , guantanamo is likely to be a major topic of discussion .
it will come up again in mid-march , when the european union sends a high-level delegation to washington to find out more details about us plans to close the controversial us military detention facility in cuba .
yet there are new indications that european countries continue to struggle on whether or not to to provide refuge to former guantanamo inmates .
the european union has welcomed the decision by us president barack obama to close down the facility , which holds about 240 prisoners who were sent there as part of the us-led effort to combat terror . but at a meeting on thursday , feb .
26 , the bloc stressed it simply does n't have enough information to decide which , if any , inmates its members should take in .
" only after we have enough information , that we will circulate to member states , only then can a decision be taken , " czech interior minister ivan langer said at talks on guantanamo between his eu counterparts in brussels .
security remains major concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries are worried about potential security risks many european countries are deeply concerned about having people who pose a potential security risk at large in the 25-nation schengen region , where border controls are minimal .
if germany decides to allow in guantanamo inmates , they could theoretically travel without hindrance to neighboring france or belgium .
at the eu meeting thursday , leaders indicated they were likely to allow european countries to host prisoners , provided they accept security restrictions agreed on by the entire bloc .
that could include limiting movement between countries or other surveillance measures .
" if they are innocent , why are they still in guantanamo and secondly , why ca n't they stay in the united states ? "
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot asked .
" we are not judging the united states , there is a need for information , we are not going to simply act in the middle of a fog . "
us looking to allies for help the us has said it wants to transfer about 60 of the prisoners elsewhere , saying that the government has determined they were not involved in terrorism acts .
yet the us does n't want to send them home , as they could face the death penalty .
the rest of the guantanamo inmates could be tried in us courts .
a few european countries , including france , italy , portugal and spain , have indicated they would likely accept inmates if strict conditions are met .
germany has indicated that it 's willing to consider accepting inmates as well , but on a case-by-case basis after a thorough security check .
the uk has already accepted several guantanamo inmates who were british citizens or residents at the time of their arrests .
detainees " are not terrorists " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups want to see guantanamo closed human rights groups said it 's important that european countries assume that not all guantanamo detainees pose a security threat .
" it is important to step away from this misconception that the detainees are terrorists simply because they were held in guantanamo , " said camilla jelbart of amnesty international , a human rights group , at a news conference in brussels on tuesday .
" we want to see europe step up -lrb- its efforts -rrb- and help end the guantanamo scandal , " jelbart said .
the inmates will be grateful to any country which would have them , said irena sabic of the center for constitutional rights , a new york-based rights group .
britain apologizes for renditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries allegedly participated in renditions zachary katznelson , a lawyer for the pressure group reprieve , represents about 30 guantanamo detainees .
he pointed out that european countries have a duty to help since many played " a dirty role " in the affair .
many european governments allowed us military flights transporting terror suspects to cross their airspace , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . "
and it goes beyond allowing the us to use airspace .
britain publicly apologized for taking part in the " rendition " of suspects detained in iraq .
the apology , made by defense secretary john hutton on thursday , was the first time britain had admitted to the practice .
hutton confirmed that in 2004 , britain turned two iraqi suspects over to the us .
the men were then subsequently transferred to afghanistan .
reprieve called hutton 's admittance a " major u-turn . "
yet they believe that the government was even more involved in renditions than it has admitted .

" this initiative complements national crisis responses and will deploy rapid , large-scale and coordinated financial assistance from the international financial institutions to support lending to the real economy through private banking groups , in particular to small- and medium-sized enterprises , " the statement said .
" the response takes into account the different macroeconomic circumstances in and financial pressures on countries in eastern europe , acknowledging the diversity of challenges stemming from the global financial retrenchment . "
central and eastern european states such as poland , hungary , latvia and the czech republic have been hit especially hard by the financial crisis .
the ebrd will provide up to six billion euros for debt , equity and trade financing for banks and businesses , the eib is to provide 11 billion euros of lending facilities , while the world bank will provide additional support worth around 7.5 billion euros , the statement from the institutions said .
european unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert zoellick says europe must come together to help eastern europe world bank president robert zoellick said friday that a coordinated european effort was needed to help central and eastern europe and ensure the " achievements of the last 20 years are not lost because of an economic crisis that is rapidly turning into a human crisis .
" i welcome the close cooperation among the ebrd , the eib and the world bank group , and am committed to making this partnership work as we move forward to address the risk of a crisis of the banking sector in eastern europe , " he said .

"
eastern european " credit crunch " ebrd president thomas mirow said friday that a number of eastern european banks were at serious risk of failing .
" our plan must be implemented as quickly as possible or there will be a credit crunch in eastern europe , that is , insufficient financing for enterprises , households and foreign trade , " he said .
" in the current crisis , numerous banks need state support via national rescue plans as well as our aid . "
the ebrd head said that at least 10 major western european banks were deeply involved in central and eastern europe , adding that " if their branch banks fail in the east it will almost certainly have an impact on the euro zone . "
western european countries most vulnerable to a collapse of the eastern european banking system are france , greece , italy , austria , sweden and germany , mirow said .

advertisement mod test remote control buggy the uk 's ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- has showcased some of its new inventions as part of its defence technology plan .
it is the first time the mod has unveiled its long-term research needs and demonstrated new technology .
the products are still in their early stages , although it is hoped many will go into service in the next few years .
the mod hopes to attract more future technology to address its combat needs .
the products unveiled were the first in a number of submissions chosen by the mod for further development .
d3o this is a long chain silicon polymer that looks and feels like silly putty .
the material can be shaped and squeezed , but a shock impact will cause it to lock together .
the idea is to use the material as body armour to protect troops from shock impacts .
it will not stop bullets , but used in conjunction with projectile-protection systems , it can help disperse the energy from a bullet .
it is being tested for use within helmets and might become a feature of peaock , an mod body armour currently in development .
saturn saturn - the sensing and automotive tactical urban reconnaissance network - is a combination of unmanned aerial vehicle -lrb- uav -rrb- and unmanned ground vehicle -lrb- ugv -rrb- that not only examines the battlefield but , say the developers , can actively spot threats .
the idea is that a platoon or company of soldiers would deploy both the ground and air vehicle to perform reconnaissance of a village or part of a town .
the uav would fly over and spot vehicles or enemy troops moving in the open , while the ugv would roll up to a building , spot which windows were open , then look to see if anyone was behind them .
the developers say the system would then try and differentiate between civilians and possible enemy contacts by looking to see if they were holding an object , such as a rifle or a rocket-propelled grenade .
pibbd the developers are calling it a mobile lab in a suitcase , which is only slightly shorter than its full title of portable integrated battlespace biological detection unit .
the purpose of the device is simple - to analyse the air and sound a warning if there is any form of biological threat .
the device works by continuously sampling the air , then mixing it with a liquid and passing it across plates with embedded antibodies .
should the air contain a biological hazard , the antibodies become active , changing the electrical properties of the plate and triggering an alarm .
at present , most mobile detection units are the site of a large van , so something that could be carried by a soldier would be a real advantage .
testudo another ugv , this is a robot scout designed to examine hostile areas from a safe distance .
the device , not much larger than a skateboard , has the capability to cover almost all types of terrain and can even climb stairs .
the developers hope the finished product would cost less than £ 5,000 and be small enough to be easily carried by a soldier .
teledyne futuristic uav 's are just one part of the mod 's vision of the future one of the problems flying helicopters in afghanistan and iraq is dust .
the down-draught from the rotor blades can kick up huge clouds , blinding the pilots and making landing very hazardous .
teledyne is a device that uses microwaves to see through dust clouds , smoke and snow , making landings far easier .
the developers plan to put teledyne through full trials later this year .

advertisement mod test remote control buggy the uk 's ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- has showcased some of its new inventions as part of its defence technology plan .
it is the first time the mod has unveiled its long-term research needs and demonstrated new technology .
the products are still in their early stages , although it is hoped many will go into service in the next few years .
the mod hopes to attract more future technology to address its combat needs .
the products unveiled were the first in a number of submissions chosen by the mod for further development .
d3o this is a long chain silicon polymer that looks and feels like silly putty .
the material can be shaped and squeezed , but a shock impact will cause it to lock together .
the idea is to use the material as body armour to protect troops from shock impacts .
it will not stop bullets , but used in conjunction with projectile-protection systems , it can help disperse the energy from a bullet .
it is being tested for use within helmets and might become a feature of peaock , an mod body armour currently in development .
saturn saturn - the sensing and automotive tactical urban reconnaissance network - is a combination of unmanned aerial vehicle -lrb- uav -rrb- and unmanned ground vehicle -lrb- ugv -rrb- that not only examines the battlefield but , say the developers , can actively spot threats .
the idea is that a platoon or company of soldiers would deploy both the ground and air vehicle to perform reconnaissance of a village or part of a town .
the uav would fly over and spot vehicles or enemy troops moving in the open , while the ugv would roll up to a building , spot which windows were open , then look to see if anyone was behind them .
the developers say the system would then try and differentiate between civilians and possible enemy contacts by looking to see if they were holding an object , such as a rifle or a rocket-propelled grenade .
pibbd the developers are calling it a mobile lab in a suitcase , which is only slightly shorter than its full title of portable integrated battlespace biological detection unit .
the purpose of the device is simple - to analyse the air and sound a warning if there is any form of biological threat .
the device works by continuously sampling the air , then mixing it with a liquid and passing it across plates with embedded antibodies .
should the air contain a biological hazard , the antibodies become active , changing the electrical properties of the plate and triggering an alarm .
at present , most mobile detection units are the site of a large van , so something that could be carried by a soldier would be a real advantage .
testudo another ugv , this is a robot scout designed to examine hostile areas from a safe distance .
the device , not much larger than a skateboard , has the capability to cover almost all types of terrain and can even climb stairs .
the developers hope the finished product would cost less than £ 5,000 and be small enough to be easily carried by a soldier .
teledyne futuristic uav 's are just one part of the mod 's vision of the future one of the problems flying helicopters in afghanistan and iraq is dust .
the down-draught from the rotor blades can kick up huge clouds , blinding the pilots and making landing very hazardous .
teledyne is a device that uses microwaves to see through dust clouds , smoke and snow , making landings far easier .
the developers plan to put teledyne through full trials later this year .

advertisement mod test remote control buggy the uk 's ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- has showcased some of its new inventions as part of its defence technology plan .
it is the first time the mod has unveiled its long-term research needs and demonstrated new technology .
the products are still in their early stages , although it is hoped many will go into service in the next few years .
the mod hopes to attract more future technology to address its combat needs .
the products unveiled were the first in a number of submissions chosen by the mod for further development .
d3o this is a long chain silicon polymer that looks and feels like silly putty .
the material can be shaped and squeezed , but a shock impact will cause it to lock together .
the idea is to use the material as body armour to protect troops from shock impacts .
it will not stop bullets , but used in conjunction with projectile-protection systems , it can help disperse the energy from a bullet .
it is being tested for use within helmets and might become a feature of peaock , an mod body armour currently in development .
saturn saturn - the sensing and automotive tactical urban reconnaissance network - is a combination of unmanned aerial vehicle -lrb- uav -rrb- and unmanned ground vehicle -lrb- ugv -rrb- that not only examines the battlefield but , say the developers , can actively spot threats .
the idea is that a platoon or company of soldiers would deploy both the ground and air vehicle to perform reconnaissance of a village or part of a town .
the uav would fly over and spot vehicles or enemy troops moving in the open , while the ugv would roll up to a building , spot which windows were open , then look to see if anyone was behind them .
the developers say the system would then try and differentiate between civilians and possible enemy contacts by looking to see if they were holding an object , such as a rifle or a rocket-propelled grenade .
pibbd the developers are calling it a mobile lab in a suitcase , which is only slightly shorter than its full title of portable integrated battlespace biological detection unit .
the purpose of the device is simple - to analyse the air and sound a warning if there is any form of biological threat .
the device works by continuously sampling the air , then mixing it with a liquid and passing it across plates with embedded antibodies .
should the air contain a biological hazard , the antibodies become active , changing the electrical properties of the plate and triggering an alarm .
at present , most mobile detection units are the site of a large van , so something that could be carried by a soldier would be a real advantage .
testudo another ugv , this is a robot scout designed to examine hostile areas from a safe distance .
the device , not much larger than a skateboard , has the capability to cover almost all types of terrain and can even climb stairs .
the developers hope the finished product would cost less than £ 5,000 and be small enough to be easily carried by a soldier .
teledyne futuristic uav 's are just one part of the mod 's vision of the future one of the problems flying helicopters in afghanistan and iraq is dust .
the down-draught from the rotor blades can kick up huge clouds , blinding the pilots and making landing very hazardous .
teledyne is a device that uses microwaves to see through dust clouds , smoke and snow , making landings far easier .
the developers plan to put teledyne through full trials later this year .

rwanda has twice invaded its larger neighbour and attacked the fdlr militia , but this time the two countries took joint action against the rebel group whose leaders have been linked to the 1994 genocide .
hundreds of people turned out to watch a joint military parade by the two armies in eastern dr congo ’ s north kivu province , where much of the conflict has been focused .
officials say the rwandan pull-out will be complete by the end of this week .
as rwandan women welcomed the soldiers home , the foreign ministry in kigali said the joint operation had " seriously weakened " the fdlr rebels .
but a bbc correspondent says civilians paid a heavy price .
despite rwandans ’ pride in their armed forces , un peacekeepers warned that the fdlr had not been neutralised , raising fears of revenge attacks by the militia .
orphanages are already filled with the victims of on-and-off fighting between the fdlr , other militias and the congolese army , which has forced more than one million people to flee since late 2006 .

3 of 7 hundreds of people turned out to watch a joint military parade by the two armies in eastern dr congo ’ s north kivu province , where much of the conflict has been focused .
4 of 7 officials say the rwandan pull-out will be complete by the end of this week .
5 of 7 as rwandan women welcomed the soldiers home , the foreign ministry in kigali said the joint operation had " seriously weakened " the fdlr rebels .
but a bbc correspondent says civilians paid a heavy price .
6 of 7 despite rwandans ’ pride in their armed forces , un peacekeepers warned that the fdlr had not been neutralised , raising fears of revenge attacks by the militia .
7 of 7 orphanages are already filled with the victims of on-and-off fighting between the fdlr , other militias and the congolese army , which has forced more than one million people to flee since late 2006 .

mr muluzi was charged on 80 counts of allegedly siphoning aid cash into his private account .
the 66-year-old was arrested earlier after turning himself in to the anti-corruption bureau in blantyre .
mr muluzi , who denies any wrongdoing , is to stand in a presidential election in may .
the authorities denied claims the case was politically motivated .
the bbc 's raphael tenthani in blantyre says dozens of riot police surrounded the court in the city centre on thursday , to stop up to 1,000 muluzi supporters reaching the building . "
it has nothing to do with the presidential campaign " hetherwick ntaba presidential advisor muluzi faces moving on he says mr muluzi was charged along with his former personal assistant , liness whisky , and both were forced to surrender their passports to receive bail .
" this is all political but dr muluzi will defend himself , " fahad assani , a lawyer representing the former president , told our correspondent .
mr muluzi , who ruled the poor southern african nation from 1994 to 2004 , was first arrested over the allegations in 2006 but the then-director of public prosecutions threw out the charges .
the latest inquiry comes amid fears violence could flare before the forthcoming presidential election .
the former presidents of mozambique , joacquim chissano , and ghana , john kufuor , were in malawi on wednesday to try to calm tensions .
' obvious stratagem ' an adviser to the current head of state , bingu wa mutharika , denied the charges against mr muluzi were politically motivated .
hetherwick ntaba told the bbc 's focus on africa programme : " it has nothing to do with the presidential campaign .
" so what the supporters are telling or are saying has completely no basis whatsoever . "
but henry mvula , mr muluzi 's aide , earlier told the bbc 's network africa programme the case was a witch-hunt .
and malawi political analyst rafiq hajat told network africa : " if a court case is initiated against a candidate , their candidacy is immediately put into doubt .
i think the political stratagem is fairly obvious . "
mr muluzi , who is leader of the opposition united democratic front , plans to stand in may against mr mutharika .
he was mr muluzi 's protege but soon after being elected , the pair fell out and mr mutharika formed his own party .
