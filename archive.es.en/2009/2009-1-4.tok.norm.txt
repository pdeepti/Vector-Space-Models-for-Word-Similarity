program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.01.2009 opinion : gaza invasion wo n't solve mideast problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp writes that israel 's ground offensive in gaza is shocking despite all the warning signs in the past days and warns the west against backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and other israeli representatives insist that their ground offensive , which began late saturday , is not intended to end the islamist hamas group 's reign in the gaza strip .
rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

" gazprom has sent today a short-notice warning threatening to reduce russian gas transit volumes by 52 million cubic meters per day -lrb- mcm / d -rrb- in one of the major routes ...
if this threat comes true this transit route to the eu would be practically excluded and out of operation , " naftogaz said in a statement issued in kiev and brussels . the volume of 52 mcm / d is close to the winter consumption of a medium-sized country such as hungary -lrb- population 10 million -rrb- . the closure of such a major artery would make it impossible for ukraine to transfer all the gas which european union states have paid for by other pipelines , even if gazprom offers to supply the gas , naftogaz said .

" gazprom has sent today a short-notice warning threatening to reduce russian gas transit volumes by 52 million cubic meters per day -lrb- mcm / d -rrb- in one of the major routes ...
if this threat comes true this transit route to the eu would be practically excluded and out of operation , " naftogaz said in a statement issued in kiev and brussels . the volume of 52 mcm / d is close to the winter consumption of a medium-sized country such as hungary -lrb- population 10 million -rrb- . the closure of such a major artery would make it impossible for ukraine to transfer all the gas which european union states have paid for by other pipelines , even if gazprom offers to supply the gas , naftogaz said . " this situation simply proves the fact that gazprom is not capable to be compliant with its commitments versus the eu countries .
this gazprom decision is a direct threat to the eu 's and ukraine 's energy security impacting detrimentally the whole gas transport system in europe , " the statement said . gas wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a transit country for large amounts of russian natural gas ukraine and russia have been engaged in a war of words ever since gazprom cut gas deliveries to ukraine on thursday in a row over contracts and allegedly unpaid bills . russia is the single largest supplier of gas to the eu , and some 80 percent of its total output flows through ukrainian pipelines . each side has repeatedly accused the other of endangering the flow of russian gas to eu markets .

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .

gaza officials have said at least 31 civilians were among the dead . continuing attacks the israeli air force continued its attacks alongside the ground offensive , hitting over 45 targets overnight and on sunday , including tunnels , weapons storage facilities , and a number of mortar shell launching areas , a statement by the israeli military said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli infantry soldiers take position on the border to gaza one of the raids also killed two senior hamas militants : hussam hamdan , held responsible for the firing of long-range grad missiles toward southern israeli cities ; and mohammed hilo , who was in charge of hamas " special forces " in khan younis . the israeli official said that although the israeli ground incursion was proceeding as planned , it would not be a rapid operation which would end in days . israeli president shimon peres on sunday rejected the possibility of a cease-fire but said israel does not intend to occupy gaza . " we do n't intend neither to occupy gaza nor to crush hamas , but to crush terror .
and hamas needs a real and serious lesson .
they are now getting it , " peres said in an interview on us television . israel : world ' understands ' on sunday , an israeli government spokesperson said that the international community understands israel 's reasons for launching the offensive . " there is on an international level much understanding of the fact that we are exercising our legitimate right to self-defense against attacks perpetrated from the territory of gaza by hamas terrorists , " said avi pazner in an interview with french radio europe 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in australia and other countries have demanded an end to the israeli attacks on gaza he pointed out that the eu 's czech presidency had described israel 's ground operation as " more defensive than offensive , " although france , which has just relinquished the eu presidency , had condemned the ground action . but on sunday , czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said that spokesman jiri frantisek potuznik , who made the comment , had blundered . " it was his personal mistake , " he told czech television .
" unfortunately it was a very serious mistake . " the czech foreign ministry has called " for the facilitation of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of the gaza strip , and … for the establishment of a cease-fire . " protests have been taking place around the world , many calling for israel to stop the attacks . but several thousand demonstrators waved israeli flags and sang hebrew hymns in paris sunday to show support for israel in its military offensive in gaza , a day after a huge pro-palestinian rally there . in consultations late saturday night , the un security council failed to even agree on the working of a statement on the conflict .
the united states has given its strong backing to israel . hamas spokesman fawzi barhum has condemned the security council action as " a farce " under american domination . but deputy us ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said : " the efforts we are making internationally are designed to establish a sustainable , durable ceasefire that 's respected by all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.01.2009 opinion : gaza invasion wo n't solve mideast problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp writes that israel 's ground offensive in gaza is shocking despite all the warning signs in the past days and warns the west against backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and other israeli representatives insist that their ground offensive , which began late saturday , is not intended to end the islamist hamas group 's reign in the gaza strip .
rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .
french president nicolas sarkozy insisted that he would continue with a planned visit to the middle east on monday despite israel 's ground war .
sarkozy is scheduled to visit egpyt , which together with france heads the mediterranean union , jordan , israel , syria and lebanon .
germany called on sunday for efforts towards a ceasefire in gaza to intensify but said that any truce must ensure israel 's long-term security .
" i am very worried by the further escalation of fighting , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement .
" this makes it all the more urgent work ... to create the conditions for a ceasfire . "
but he added : " this must guarantee israel 's long-term security .
this does not only mean that hamas at last stops firing rockets .
the smuggling of weapons into the gaza strip must also be properly prevented . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .
french president nicolas sarkozy insisted that he would continue with a planned visit to the middle east on monday despite israel 's ground war .
sarkozy is scheduled to visit egpyt , which together with france heads the mediterranean union , jordan , israel , syria and lebanon .
germany called on sunday for efforts towards a ceasefire in gaza to intensify but said that any truce must ensure israel 's long-term security .
" i am very worried by the further escalation of fighting , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement .
" this makes it all the more urgent work ... to create the conditions for a ceasfire . "
but he added : " this must guarantee israel 's long-term security .
this does not only mean that hamas at last stops firing rockets .
the smuggling of weapons into the gaza strip must also be properly prevented . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .
27 as israel 's ground forces pushed deeper into the territory .
gaza officials have said at least 31 civilians were among the dead . continuing attacks the israeli air force continued its attacks alongside the ground offensive , hitting over 45 targets overnight and on sunday , including tunnels , weapons storage facilities , and a number of mortar shell launching areas , a statement by the israeli military said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli infantry soldiers take position on the border to gaza one of the raids also killed two senior hamas militants : hussam hamdan , held responsible for the firing of long-range grad missiles toward southern israeli cities ; and mohammed hilo , who was in charge of hamas " special forces " in khan younis . the israeli official said that although the israeli ground incursion was proceeding as planned , it would not be a rapid operation which would end in days . israeli president shimon peres on sunday rejected the possibility of a cease-fire but said israel does not intend to occupy gaza . " we do n't intend neither to occupy gaza nor to crush hamas , but to crush terror .
and hamas needs a real and serious lesson .
they are now getting it , " peres said in an interview on us television . israel : world ' understands ' on sunday , an israeli government spokesperson said that the international community understands israel 's reasons for launching the offensive . " there is on an international level much understanding of the fact that we are exercising our legitimate right to self-defense against attacks perpetrated from the territory of gaza by hamas terrorists , " said avi pazner in an interview with french radio europe 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in australia and other countries have demanded an end to the israeli attacks on gaza he pointed out that the eu 's czech presidency had described israel 's ground operation as " more defensive than offensive , " although france , which has just relinquished the eu presidency , had condemned the ground action . but on sunday , czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said that spokesman jiri frantisek potuznik , who made the comment , had blundered . " it was his personal mistake , " he told czech television .
" unfortunately it was a very serious mistake . " the czech foreign ministry has called " for the facilitation of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of the gaza strip , and … for the establishment of a cease-fire .

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .
french president nicolas sarkozy insisted that he would continue with a planned visit to the middle east on monday despite israel 's ground war .
sarkozy is scheduled to visit egpyt , which together with france heads the mediterranean union , jordan , israel , syria and lebanon .
germany called on sunday for efforts towards a ceasefire in gaza to intensify but said that any truce must ensure israel 's long-term security .
" i am very worried by the further escalation of fighting , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement .
" this makes it all the more urgent work ... to create the conditions for a ceasfire . "
but he added : " this must guarantee israel 's long-term security .
this does not only mean that hamas at last stops firing rockets .
the smuggling of weapons into the gaza strip must also be properly prevented . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .
27 as israel 's ground forces pushed deeper into the territory .
gaza officials have said at least 31 civilians were among the dead . continuing attacks the israeli air force continued its attacks alongside the ground offensive , hitting over 45 targets overnight and on sunday , including tunnels , weapons storage facilities , and a number of mortar shell launching areas , a statement by the israeli military said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli infantry soldiers take position on the border to gaza one of the raids also killed two senior hamas militants : hussam hamdan , held responsible for the firing of long-range grad missiles toward southern israeli cities ; and mohammed hilo , who was in charge of hamas " special forces " in khan younis . the israeli official said that although the israeli ground incursion was proceeding as planned , it would not be a rapid operation which would end in days . israeli president shimon peres on sunday rejected the possibility of a cease-fire but said israel does not intend to occupy gaza . " we do n't intend neither to occupy gaza nor to crush hamas , but to crush terror .
and hamas needs a real and serious lesson .
they are now getting it , " peres said in an interview on us television . israel : world ' understands ' on sunday , an israeli government spokesperson said that the international community understands israel 's reasons for launching the offensive . " there is on an international level much understanding of the fact that we are exercising our legitimate right to self-defense against attacks perpetrated from the territory of gaza by hamas terrorists , " said avi pazner in an interview with french radio europe 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in australia and other countries have demanded an end to the israeli attacks on gaza he pointed out that the eu 's czech presidency had described israel 's ground operation as " more defensive than offensive , " although france , which has just relinquished the eu presidency , had condemned the ground action . but on sunday , czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said that spokesman jiri frantisek potuznik , who made the comment , had blundered . " it was his personal mistake , " he told czech television .
" unfortunately it was a very serious mistake . " the czech foreign ministry has called " for the facilitation of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of the gaza strip , and … for the establishment of a cease-fire . " protests have been taking place around the world , many calling for israel to stop the attacks . but several thousand demonstrators waved israeli flags and sang hebrew hymns in paris sunday to show support for israel in its military offensive in gaza , a day after a huge pro-palestinian rally there . in consultations late saturday night , the un security council failed to even agree on the working of a statement on the conflict .
the united states has given its strong backing to israel . hamas spokesman fawzi barhum has condemned the security council action as " a farce " under american domination . but deputy us ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said : " the efforts we are making internationally are designed to establish a sustainable , durable ceasefire that 's respected by all .

" gazprom has sent today a short-notice warning threatening to reduce russian gas transit volumes by 52 million cubic meters per day -lrb- mcm / d -rrb- in one of the major routes ...
if this threat comes true this transit route to the eu would be practically excluded and out of operation , " naftogaz said in a statement issued in kiev and brussels . the volume of 52 mcm / d is close to the winter consumption of a medium-sized country such as hungary -lrb- population 10 million -rrb- . the closure of such a major artery would make it impossible for ukraine to transfer all the gas which european union states have paid for by other pipelines , even if gazprom offers to supply the gas , naftogaz said . " this situation simply proves the fact that gazprom is not capable to be compliant with its commitments versus the eu countries .
this gazprom decision is a direct threat to the eu 's and ukraine 's energy security impacting detrimentally the whole gas transport system in europe , " the statement said . gas wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a transit country for large amounts of russian natural gas ukraine and russia have been engaged in a war of words ever since gazprom cut gas deliveries to ukraine on thursday in a row over contracts and allegedly unpaid bills . russia is the single largest supplier of gas to the eu , and some 80 percent of its total output flows through ukrainian pipelines . each side has repeatedly accused the other of endangering the flow of russian gas to eu markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.01.2009 opinion : gaza invasion wo n't solve mideast problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp writes that israel 's ground offensive in gaza is shocking despite all the warning signs in the past days and warns the west against backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and other israeli representatives insist that their ground offensive , which began late saturday , is not intended to end the islamist hamas group 's reign in the gaza strip .
rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .

rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

" gazprom has sent today a short-notice warning threatening to reduce russian gas transit volumes by 52 million cubic meters per day -lrb- mcm / d -rrb- in one of the major routes ...
if this threat comes true this transit route to the eu would be practically excluded and out of operation , " naftogaz said in a statement issued in kiev and brussels . the volume of 52 mcm / d is close to the winter consumption of a medium-sized country such as hungary -lrb- population 10 million -rrb- . the closure of such a major artery would make it impossible for ukraine to transfer all the gas which european union states have paid for by other pipelines , even if gazprom offers to supply the gas , naftogaz said . " this situation simply proves the fact that gazprom is not capable to be compliant with its commitments versus the eu countries .
this gazprom decision is a direct threat to the eu 's and ukraine 's energy security impacting detrimentally the whole gas transport system in europe , " the statement said . gas wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a transit country for large amounts of russian natural gas ukraine and russia have been engaged in a war of words ever since gazprom cut gas deliveries to ukraine on thursday in a row over contracts and allegedly unpaid bills . russia is the single largest supplier of gas to the eu , and some 80 percent of its total output flows through ukrainian pipelines . each side has repeatedly accused the other of endangering the flow of russian gas to eu markets .
both have sent diplomatic missions to western capitals , and ukraine has issued a series of statements to the foreign press in the eu 's capital , brussels . initial reports from central and eastern european eu states have presented conflicting views of the current rate of gas deliveries .
in the latest report , on sunday czech officials said that the country had received 5 percent less gas than it had ordered . the eu presidency , which the czech republic took over on january 1 , has said it wo n't mediate in the " commercial dispute " between moscow and kiev , but insists on compliance with delivery commitments for western europe . eu representatives are scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on the row on monday and could send an investigating team to the two countries within days , officials in brussels said saturday . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" gazprom has sent today a short-notice warning threatening to reduce russian gas transit volumes by 52 million cubic meters per day -lrb- mcm / d -rrb- in one of the major routes ...
if this threat comes true this transit route to the eu would be practically excluded and out of operation , " naftogaz said in a statement issued in kiev and brussels . the volume of 52 mcm / d is close to the winter consumption of a medium-sized country such as hungary -lrb- population 10 million -rrb- . the closure of such a major artery would make it impossible for ukraine to transfer all the gas which european union states have paid for by other pipelines , even if gazprom offers to supply the gas , naftogaz said . " this situation simply proves the fact that gazprom is not capable to be compliant with its commitments versus the eu countries .
this gazprom decision is a direct threat to the eu 's and ukraine 's energy security impacting detrimentally the whole gas transport system in europe , " the statement said . gas wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a transit country for large amounts of russian natural gas ukraine and russia have been engaged in a war of words ever since gazprom cut gas deliveries to ukraine on thursday in a row over contracts and allegedly unpaid bills . russia is the single largest supplier of gas to the eu , and some 80 percent of its total output flows through ukrainian pipelines . each side has repeatedly accused the other of endangering the flow of russian gas to eu markets .

earlier , the un security council failed to agree on a statement calling for a ceasefire . israeli forces pushed deeper into the gaza strip on saturday with clashes reported in gaza city , the northern town of beit lahiya and the jabaliya refugee camp . the ground operation in the gaza strip came after eight days of heavy aerial bombardment in what israel says is a retaliatory offensive to stop hamas firing rockets into israeli territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises above gaza during the israeli offensive both sides have reported casualties .
earlier , the israeli army said 30 of its soldiers had been wounded in the ground offensive , two of them seriously . palestinian medical officials said at least 19 gazans had been killed in the israeli incursion .
that brings the palestinian death toll since the start of the air campaign on dec .
27 to more than 450 , they said . un fails to find common ground the un security council late saturday failed to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip in the wake of israel 's ground invasion of the gaza strip . despite widespread international condemnation and calls by the un secretary general for an immediate halt to operations . , the 15-member body could not overcome all differences of opinion to issue a common statement . the french ambassador to the security council , jean-maurice ripert , told reporters the 15-member body could not agree on a statement that would call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza . us blocks security council resolution according to diplomats , the united states had thwarted libya 's efforts to persuade the un security council to call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza . libya , the only arab member of the council , had circulated a draft statement expressing " serious concern at the escalation of the situation in gaza , in particular , after the launching of the israeli ground offensive " and urged all parties " to observe an immediate ceasefire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council failed to find common ground despite the escalating violence but diplomats said the united states refused to back the libyan-drafted text and killed the initiative , since council statements must be passed unanimously .
later the united states refused to back a watered-down call for a truce , the diplomats said . the united states , one of five permanent security council members , insists that any statement or resolution state that the palestinian militant group hamas is a terrorist organization that seized power in gaza from the legitimate palestinian authority . us envoy to the security council alejandro wolff said there was no point in issuing statements that hamas , which unilaterally declared an end to a six-month old ceasefire last month , would ignore . " i do n't think it does the council any good ... to issue statements that are n't going to be observed , " wolff said .
" israel 's self-defence is not negotiable . " libya and other arab states oppose the us position , leaving the security council deadlocked on the gaza crisis .
the emergency session on saturday was the third such consultation on gaza since the conflict erupted on dec .

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .
27 as israel 's ground forces pushed deeper into the territory .
gaza officials have said at least 31 civilians were among the dead . continuing attacks the israeli air force continued its attacks alongside the ground offensive , hitting over 45 targets overnight and on sunday , including tunnels , weapons storage facilities , and a number of mortar shell launching areas , a statement by the israeli military said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli infantry soldiers take position on the border to gaza one of the raids also killed two senior hamas militants : hussam hamdan , held responsible for the firing of long-range grad missiles toward southern israeli cities ; and mohammed hilo , who was in charge of hamas " special forces " in khan younis . the israeli official said that although the israeli ground incursion was proceeding as planned , it would not be a rapid operation which would end in days . israeli president shimon peres on sunday rejected the possibility of a cease-fire but said israel does not intend to occupy gaza . " we do n't intend neither to occupy gaza nor to crush hamas , but to crush terror .
and hamas needs a real and serious lesson .
they are now getting it , " peres said in an interview on us television . israel : world ' understands ' on sunday , an israeli government spokesperson said that the international community understands israel 's reasons for launching the offensive . " there is on an international level much understanding of the fact that we are exercising our legitimate right to self-defense against attacks perpetrated from the territory of gaza by hamas terrorists , " said avi pazner in an interview with french radio europe 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in australia and other countries have demanded an end to the israeli attacks on gaza he pointed out that the eu 's czech presidency had described israel 's ground operation as " more defensive than offensive , " although france , which has just relinquished the eu presidency , had condemned the ground action . but on sunday , czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said that spokesman jiri frantisek potuznik , who made the comment , had blundered . " it was his personal mistake , " he told czech television .
" unfortunately it was a very serious mistake . " the czech foreign ministry has called " for the facilitation of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of the gaza strip , and … for the establishment of a cease-fire . " protests have been taking place around the world , many calling for israel to stop the attacks . but several thousand demonstrators waved israeli flags and sang hebrew hymns in paris sunday to show support for israel in its military offensive in gaza , a day after a huge pro-palestinian rally there . in consultations late saturday night , the un security council failed to even agree on the working of a statement on the conflict .
the united states has given its strong backing to israel . hamas spokesman fawzi barhum has condemned the security council action as " a farce " under american domination . but deputy us ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said : " the efforts we are making internationally are designed to establish a sustainable , durable ceasefire that 's respected by all .

" gazprom has sent today a short-notice warning threatening to reduce russian gas transit volumes by 52 million cubic meters per day -lrb- mcm / d -rrb- in one of the major routes ...
if this threat comes true this transit route to the eu would be practically excluded and out of operation , " naftogaz said in a statement issued in kiev and brussels . the volume of 52 mcm / d is close to the winter consumption of a medium-sized country such as hungary -lrb- population 10 million -rrb- . the closure of such a major artery would make it impossible for ukraine to transfer all the gas which european union states have paid for by other pipelines , even if gazprom offers to supply the gas , naftogaz said . " this situation simply proves the fact that gazprom is not capable to be compliant with its commitments versus the eu countries .
this gazprom decision is a direct threat to the eu 's and ukraine 's energy security impacting detrimentally the whole gas transport system in europe , " the statement said . gas wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is a transit country for large amounts of russian natural gas ukraine and russia have been engaged in a war of words ever since gazprom cut gas deliveries to ukraine on thursday in a row over contracts and allegedly unpaid bills . russia is the single largest supplier of gas to the eu , and some 80 percent of its total output flows through ukrainian pipelines . each side has repeatedly accused the other of endangering the flow of russian gas to eu markets .

rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .
french president nicolas sarkozy insisted that he would continue with a planned visit to the middle east on monday despite israel 's ground war .
sarkozy is scheduled to visit egpyt , which together with france heads the mediterranean union , jordan , israel , syria and lebanon .
germany called on sunday for efforts towards a ceasefire in gaza to intensify but said that any truce must ensure israel 's long-term security .
" i am very worried by the further escalation of fighting , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement .
" this makes it all the more urgent work ... to create the conditions for a ceasfire . "
but he added : " this must guarantee israel 's long-term security .
this does not only mean that hamas at last stops firing rockets .
the smuggling of weapons into the gaza strip must also be properly prevented . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .
french president nicolas sarkozy insisted that he would continue with a planned visit to the middle east on monday despite israel 's ground war .
sarkozy is scheduled to visit egpyt , which together with france heads the mediterranean union , jordan , israel , syria and lebanon .
germany called on sunday for efforts towards a ceasefire in gaza to intensify but said that any truce must ensure israel 's long-term security .
" i am very worried by the further escalation of fighting , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement .
" this makes it all the more urgent work ... to create the conditions for a ceasfire . "
but he added : " this must guarantee israel 's long-term security .
this does not only mean that hamas at last stops firing rockets .
the smuggling of weapons into the gaza strip must also be properly prevented . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.01.2009 opinion : gaza invasion wo n't solve mideast problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp writes that israel 's ground offensive in gaza is shocking despite all the warning signs in the past days and warns the west against backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and other israeli representatives insist that their ground offensive , which began late saturday , is not intended to end the islamist hamas group 's reign in the gaza strip .
rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.01.2009 opinion : gaza invasion wo n't solve mideast problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp writes that israel 's ground offensive in gaza is shocking despite all the warning signs in the past days and warns the west against backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and other israeli representatives insist that their ground offensive , which began late saturday , is not intended to end the islamist hamas group 's reign in the gaza strip .
rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.01.2009 ukraine says russia threatens to cut gas to europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine says its gas gauges could fall to zero , threatening eu supplies russia has threatened to slash the volume of gas flowing through one of its major pipelines via ukraine to europe , seriously endangering supplies to the eu , ukrainian gas company naftogaz said sunday . " gazprom has sent today a short-notice warning threatening to reduce russian gas transit volumes by 52 million cubic meters per day -lrb- mcm / d -rrb- in one of the major routes ...
if this threat comes true this transit route to the eu would be practically excluded and out of operation , " naftogaz said in a statement issued in kiev and brussels . the volume of 52 mcm / d is close to the winter consumption of a medium-sized country such as hungary -lrb- population 10 million -rrb- . the closure of such a major artery would make it impossible for ukraine to transfer all the gas which european union states have paid for by other pipelines , even if gazprom offers to supply the gas , naftogaz said .

earlier , the un security council failed to agree on a statement calling for a ceasefire . israeli forces pushed deeper into the gaza strip on saturday with clashes reported in gaza city , the northern town of beit lahiya and the jabaliya refugee camp . the ground operation in the gaza strip came after eight days of heavy aerial bombardment in what israel says is a retaliatory offensive to stop hamas firing rockets into israeli territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises above gaza during the israeli offensive both sides have reported casualties .
earlier , the israeli army said 30 of its soldiers had been wounded in the ground offensive , two of them seriously . palestinian medical officials said at least 19 gazans had been killed in the israeli incursion .
that brings the palestinian death toll since the start of the air campaign on dec .
27 to more than 450 , they said . un fails to find common ground the un security council late saturday failed to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip in the wake of israel 's ground invasion of the gaza strip . despite widespread international condemnation and calls by the un secretary general for an immediate halt to operations . , the 15-member body could not overcome all differences of opinion to issue a common statement . the french ambassador to the security council , jean-maurice ripert , told reporters the 15-member body could not agree on a statement that would call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza . us blocks security council resolution according to diplomats , the united states had thwarted libya 's efforts to persuade the un security council to call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza . libya , the only arab member of the council , had circulated a draft statement expressing " serious concern at the escalation of the situation in gaza , in particular , after the launching of the israeli ground offensive " and urged all parties " to observe an immediate ceasefire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council failed to find common ground despite the escalating violence but diplomats said the united states refused to back the libyan-drafted text and killed the initiative , since council statements must be passed unanimously .
later the united states refused to back a watered-down call for a truce , the diplomats said . the united states , one of five permanent security council members , insists that any statement or resolution state that the palestinian militant group hamas is a terrorist organization that seized power in gaza from the legitimate palestinian authority . us envoy to the security council alejandro wolff said there was no point in issuing statements that hamas , which unilaterally declared an end to a six-month old ceasefire last month , would ignore . " i do n't think it does the council any good ... to issue statements that are n't going to be observed , " wolff said .
" israel 's self-defence is not negotiable . " libya and other arab states oppose the us position , leaving the security council deadlocked on the gaza crisis .
the emergency session on saturday was the third such consultation on gaza since the conflict erupted on dec .
27 . israel : ground operation " wo n't be easy or short " wearing night-vision goggles and camouflage paint on their faces , israeli soldiers flanked by columns of tanks entered the densely populated enclave on jan .
3 from four points as combat helicopters flew overhead . israel said it had called up tens of thousands of reservists and the military 's chief spokesman estimated the operation in the hamas-run enclave could run " many long days " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak has warned the ground offensive wo n't be a short one the ground operation is the second stage of the israeli offensive which began last dec .
27 , and was intended to destroy hamas operations , and to lower the number of rockets being fired at israel . israeli defence minister ehud barak told reporters in tel aviv that the sole aim of the military operation was to " protect the home front " and prevent hamas from being able to fire rockets at israeli territory . he said the ground campaign against hamas " will not be easy or short , but we are determined " . hamas warns of " black destiny " the islamic hamas movement warned israel saturday night that by sending ground troops into gaza it was falling into " the trap that our fighters had prepared for its soldiers and tanks .

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .

rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.01.2009 opinion : gaza invasion wo n't solve mideast problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's peter philipp writes that israel 's ground offensive in gaza is shocking despite all the warning signs in the past days and warns the west against backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and other israeli representatives insist that their ground offensive , which began late saturday , is not intended to end the islamist hamas group 's reign in the gaza strip .
rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .
27 as israel 's ground forces pushed deeper into the territory .
gaza officials have said at least 31 civilians were among the dead . continuing attacks the israeli air force continued its attacks alongside the ground offensive , hitting over 45 targets overnight and on sunday , including tunnels , weapons storage facilities , and a number of mortar shell launching areas , a statement by the israeli military said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli infantry soldiers take position on the border to gaza one of the raids also killed two senior hamas militants : hussam hamdan , held responsible for the firing of long-range grad missiles toward southern israeli cities ; and mohammed hilo , who was in charge of hamas " special forces " in khan younis . the israeli official said that although the israeli ground incursion was proceeding as planned , it would not be a rapid operation which would end in days . israeli president shimon peres on sunday rejected the possibility of a cease-fire but said israel does not intend to occupy gaza . " we do n't intend neither to occupy gaza nor to crush hamas , but to crush terror .
and hamas needs a real and serious lesson .
they are now getting it , " peres said in an interview on us television . israel : world ' understands ' on sunday , an israeli government spokesperson said that the international community understands israel 's reasons for launching the offensive . " there is on an international level much understanding of the fact that we are exercising our legitimate right to self-defense against attacks perpetrated from the territory of gaza by hamas terrorists , " said avi pazner in an interview with french radio europe 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in australia and other countries have demanded an end to the israeli attacks on gaza he pointed out that the eu 's czech presidency had described israel 's ground operation as " more defensive than offensive , " although france , which has just relinquished the eu presidency , had condemned the ground action . but on sunday , czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said that spokesman jiri frantisek potuznik , who made the comment , had blundered . " it was his personal mistake , " he told czech television .
" unfortunately it was a very serious mistake . " the czech foreign ministry has called " for the facilitation of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of the gaza strip , and … for the establishment of a cease-fire . " protests have been taking place around the world , many calling for israel to stop the attacks . but several thousand demonstrators waved israeli flags and sang hebrew hymns in paris sunday to show support for israel in its military offensive in gaza , a day after a huge pro-palestinian rally there . in consultations late saturday night , the un security council failed to even agree on the working of a statement on the conflict .
the united states has given its strong backing to israel . hamas spokesman fawzi barhum has condemned the security council action as " a farce " under american domination . but deputy us ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said : " the efforts we are making internationally are designed to establish a sustainable , durable ceasefire that 's respected by all .
and that means no more rocket attacks . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .
french president nicolas sarkozy insisted that he would continue with a planned visit to the middle east on monday despite israel 's ground war .
sarkozy is scheduled to visit egpyt , which together with france heads the mediterranean union , jordan , israel , syria and lebanon .
germany called on sunday for efforts towards a ceasefire in gaza to intensify but said that any truce must ensure israel 's long-term security .
" i am very worried by the further escalation of fighting , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement .
" this makes it all the more urgent work ... to create the conditions for a ceasfire . "
but he added : " this must guarantee israel 's long-term security .

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .

" we do n't intend neither to occupy gaza nor to crush hamas , but to crush terror .
and hamas needs a real and serious lesson .
they are now getting it , " peres said in an interview on us television . israel : world ' understands ' on sunday , an israeli government spokesperson said that the international community understands israel 's reasons for launching the offensive .

" it was his personal mistake , " he told czech television .
" unfortunately it was a very serious mistake . " the czech foreign ministry has called " for the facilitation of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of the gaza strip , and … for the establishment of a cease-fire . " protests have been taking place around the world , many calling for israel to stop the attacks . but several thousand demonstrators waved israeli flags and sang hebrew hymns in paris sunday to show support for israel in its military offensive in gaza , a day after a huge pro-palestinian rally there . in consultations late saturday night , the un security council failed to even agree on the working of a statement on the conflict .
the united states has given its strong backing to israel . hamas spokesman fawzi barhum has condemned the security council action as " a farce " under american domination . but deputy us ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said : " the efforts we are making internationally are designed to establish a sustainable , durable ceasefire that 's respected by all .

the eu says the aid - food , emergency shelter repairs and medical aid - will be provided through the united nations to gaza palestinians .
" one and a half million people are crammed into an area that is just over one percent the size of belgium .
they rely on supplies from outside for their survival and , with every day that passes , their situation becomes more desperate , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a statement .
michel urged israel to let the aid through .
the obligation to respect the principals of international humanitarian law " is universal and attacks from either side that kill or injure civilians indiscriminately are unacceptable , " he added .
the eu is the largest aid donor to the palestinian territories .
in 2008 , the bloc provided more than 73 million euros in humanitarian , 56 percent of it in the gaza strip .
seeking diplomatic solutions meanwhile , european politicians continued to explore diplomatic options in an effort to halt the escalating violence after israel launched a ground offensive into gaza following a week of air raids over the territory .
despite the setback provided by the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in the gaza strip , a host of european leaders vowed to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the bloodshed .
uk prime minister gordon brown told the bbc the international community should work harder for an immediate ceasefire .
french president nicolas sarkozy insisted that he would continue with a planned visit to the middle east on monday despite israel 's ground war .
sarkozy is scheduled to visit egpyt , which together with france heads the mediterranean union , jordan , israel , syria and lebanon .
germany called on sunday for efforts towards a ceasefire in gaza to intensify but said that any truce must ensure israel 's long-term security .
" i am very worried by the further escalation of fighting , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement .
" this makes it all the more urgent work ... to create the conditions for a ceasfire . "
but he added : " this must guarantee israel 's long-term security .

4 thousands of israeli troops backed by tanks battled hamas militants in gaza on sunday .
at least 39 palestinians were killed as families fled battlefield towns . continuing the second stage of a massive offensive against militants in gaza , israeli troops pushed further into the strip on sunday , where they fought palestinian gunmen and cut the enclave in two , deploying south of gaza city and seizing control of a major traffic artery . the offensive has begun to claim civilian lives .
palestinian medics said the ground operation has killed at least 39 palestinians , including a mother and her four children .
some 150 have been wounded .
most of gaza is now without electricity and food supplies are said to be running low . israel has said one of its soldiers was killed and at least 30 wounded , one critically and two seriously , since the army first moved into the gaza strip on saturday night . the israeli military spokesman dismissed as untrue militants ' claims that they killed nine israeli soldiers .
another military official said reports that an israeli soldier had been captured were not accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks are backing up the ground offensive the official , speaking to the dpa news service on condition of anonymity , said that most of the resistance the israelis had encountered so far came from mortars , although other israeli spokesmen said close-quarters combat has taken place . " we are operating in a very challenging area that has been well-prepared by hamas in order to repel attacks , " the official said . hamas has vowed to make gaza a " cemetery " for israeli troops . civilians in gaza residents in gaza said more than half of the enclave appeared to be occupied by the israelis , who were taking up positions outside major towns , and avoiding entering densely populated areas . gaza city turned into a virtual ghost town on sunday as shops closed and most people stayed inside their homes . the international committee of the red cross says both parties are obliged under international humanitarian law to avoid attacks on civilians and public buildings . pierre kraehenbuehl , the agency 's director of operations , said sunday he was worried about the growing number of civilians killed and injured and hospitals being damaged .
the death toll in the gaza strip has risen to over 512 since dec .
27 as israel 's ground forces pushed deeper into the territory .
gaza officials have said at least 31 civilians were among the dead . continuing attacks the israeli air force continued its attacks alongside the ground offensive , hitting over 45 targets overnight and on sunday , including tunnels , weapons storage facilities , and a number of mortar shell launching areas , a statement by the israeli military said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli infantry soldiers take position on the border to gaza one of the raids also killed two senior hamas militants : hussam hamdan , held responsible for the firing of long-range grad missiles toward southern israeli cities ; and mohammed hilo , who was in charge of hamas " special forces " in khan younis . the israeli official said that although the israeli ground incursion was proceeding as planned , it would not be a rapid operation which would end in days . israeli president shimon peres on sunday rejected the possibility of a cease-fire but said israel does not intend to occupy gaza . " we do n't intend neither to occupy gaza nor to crush hamas , but to crush terror .
and hamas needs a real and serious lesson .
they are now getting it , " peres said in an interview on us television . israel : world ' understands ' on sunday , an israeli government spokesperson said that the international community understands israel 's reasons for launching the offensive . " there is on an international level much understanding of the fact that we are exercising our legitimate right to self-defense against attacks perpetrated from the territory of gaza by hamas terrorists , " said avi pazner in an interview with french radio europe 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in australia and other countries have demanded an end to the israeli attacks on gaza he pointed out that the eu 's czech presidency had described israel 's ground operation as " more defensive than offensive , " although france , which has just relinquished the eu presidency , had condemned the ground action . but on sunday , czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said that spokesman jiri frantisek potuznik , who made the comment , had blundered . " it was his personal mistake , " he told czech television .
" unfortunately it was a very serious mistake . " the czech foreign ministry has called " for the facilitation of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of the gaza strip , and … for the establishment of a cease-fire . " protests have been taking place around the world , many calling for israel to stop the attacks . but several thousand demonstrators waved israeli flags and sang hebrew hymns in paris sunday to show support for israel in its military offensive in gaza , a day after a huge pro-palestinian rally there . in consultations late saturday night , the un security council failed to even agree on the working of a statement on the conflict .
the united states has given its strong backing to israel . hamas spokesman fawzi barhum has condemned the security council action as " a farce " under american domination . but deputy us ambassador to the un , alejandro wolff , said : " the efforts we are making internationally are designed to establish a sustainable , durable ceasefire that 's respected by all .

rather , the aim of the offensive is to halt further rocket attacks from there into israeli , they say .
but the facts - as far as they are known given that the international media is prevented from entering gaza - tell another story : targeted attacks on leading hamas representatives , the destruction of ministries and administration buildings and the constant killing and injuring of civilians - every fourth casualty is reported to be a civilian - have very little to do with israel 's stated aim of ending hamas rocket fire .
instead , it all hints at an effort to wipe out hamas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp since both goals ca n't be achieved with fighter jets either in the short or long term , israeli troops have now entered gaza .
though the troops have been massing on the border to gaza for days , the go-ahead for a ground offensive has sparked shock .
that 's because the incursion into gaza adds a new dimension to the armed conflict , one whose outcome is even more uncertain than before .
air strikes can be stopped in a moment , not so a ground invasion .
and a troop pullback ca n't afford to be seen , in the eyes of those responsible , as a defeat or flight because that would make all the victims - even those on their own side - seem senseless .
a pullback thus has to be linked with success .
but the question is - what success can israel hope to achieve in gaza ?
it ca n't be the certainty that some day no more rockets will be launched from there into israel .
rather , it 's the hope of smashing hamas in gaza so that palestinian president mahmoud abbas from the fatah faction , which has signed up to the peace process , can regain power again and israel would once again have an acceptable negotiating partner .
it may sound far-fetched but it 's apparently what olmert 's government is thinking even though they have sufficiently proven in the past that they did n't take seriously an acceptable negotiating partner on the palestinian side .
the only alternative would be a renewed permanent occupation of the gaza strip .
but nobody wants that in israel .
in 2005 , it was the nationalist leader ariel sharon who pulled out of gaza in order to free his country from the burden .
that 's why the invasion of gaza will probably not solve any of the questions and problems and will probably once again lead to a fragile truce which will contain the next cycle of violence .
only this time , the hundreds of dead will further poison the atmosphere , ensuring that the conflict will get tougher each time .
this should be kept in mind by those , particularly in washington , but also in european capitals - including berlin - who are backing israel in a falsely understood show of solidarity because they say israel has a right to self-defense .
of course , israel has that right .
but because the country seems to descend further into chaos in defending that right , it 's probably time to save israel from itself .

for 17 years the mother of one had struggled through almost ten days of hell each month .
" you think it is normal , " she said .
" everyone talks about premenstrual stress -lrb- pms -rrb- , everybody talks about the same symptoms , the cramps and the mood swings but the difference with me was the severity . "
mending cracks but it was not until her long suffering husband , john walked out after 17 years of marriage , that marie , aged 38 , from the west midlands , finally went for the help she needed .
she went to marriage counsellors relate , researched her pms on the national association for premenstrual syndrome website and finally went to her doctor for help . "
you shut yourself away from the people you love " marie seward " i did not know until i went to the doctors that my pms was not on the scale of normal , " she said .
" she asked why had i not come sooner , but i did n't know .
" everything was in excess , irrational behaviour , irrational thinking .
you think everything is against you , that your whole world is falling apart .
it is like living an out of body experience .
" the snapping is the worst - it is terrible .
" you just cry and cry , and nothing anyone can do will help .
you feel ugly and fat and unattractive .
you just keep putting yourself down .
this hormone just takes over your life .
" the symptoms come on and you ca n't manage them .
" it is terrible .
you can be moody , but then you become insular you hate the way you look , the way you feel .
you shut yourself away from the people you love , which was why our marriage broke down .
memory loss " i could n't remember any of the things i had said or done to john , but i was terribly argumentative .
" everything was an issue it could be something as simple as the way he put his cup down on the table .
you become very sensitive . "
marie was prescribed antidepressants .
she and john were also given counselling help to get their marriage back on track with counsellors encouraging them to listen to each other .
now , after six months apart they are back together and planning to renew their vows .
" we are now very happy as a family .
my son is elated that daddy has come home , " she said .
but john said it had been a struggle .
" pmt has always been a bit of a joke amongst blokes , " he said .
" when a woman makes a funny comment it is : ' oh , it must be her time of the month ' - and plenty of other derogatory comments .
" but when i talked to other men their wives or girlfriends never seemed to have the same symptoms as bad and for as long as marie .
" at the time we did not realise what it was .
we thought it was just bad pmt , but it would last 10-12 days every month .
snappy and argumentative " marie would say something to me and think she had said something different .
" and she would have a go at me and i thought maybe it had been me mishearing or not listening . "
john said it had been a terribly difficult decision to leave home , but felt that eventually he had little option , as he simply was not being listened to . "
it is not surprising , that if pms is not successfully managed , it can be the cause of relationship breakdown " jackie howe " after a very painful six months , and an awful lot of talking and soul searching , we are now back together , stronger than ever , working and talking things through together , " he said .
" we are now communicating better than we have done for years .
" it is so much better .
we both understand about the symptoms and can cope with them better . "
nick panay , a consultant gynaecologist and chairman of naps , said people often underestimated the strain problems like this could place on a marriage .
" i think the difficulty in relationships is one of the most distressing aspects of the whole condition , " he said .
" but it is a feature of the severest form of pms that relationships with partners - and the rest of the family - break down .
" i think a lot of professionals remain unaware of the impact that this condition can have on relationships - and i think that is one of the reasons it is not taken as seriously as it might be .
" i see couples in my clinic who love each other deeply , but who are also on the verge of divorce , or have problems with their relationship because it is a situation that ca n't be controlled without appropriate medical intervention . "
jackie howe , of naps agreed : " sudden changes in mood , aggression , excessive irritability , withdrawal and loss of libido are symptoms which are often present in the premenstrual and a sufferer 's partner will find these very difficult to cope with , especially when at another time in the cycle his partner acts quite differently .
" it is not surprising , that if pms is not successfully managed , it can be the cause of relationship breakdown . "

i 'm not just talking about moderating the usual christmas excess -lrb- not such a bad idea anyway -rrb- but ensuring i have the equivalent of what i consider is a cabbage soup diet for two or three days .
this is so i can give blood .
or more accurately , platelets , that component of blood which helps to stop or prevent bleeding .
i 'm one of fewer than 450 people in wales who regularly donate platelets , and one of just 64 whose combination of blood group , tissue type and accessible veins make me ideal as a donor to vulnerable groups of patients such as babies , bone marrow transplantees and people with cancer .
the cabbage soup challenge is so my blood stream is not coursing with fat at the time of the donation .
i have yet to live down my first donor session which had to be aborted because the platelets , a dark brownish yellow when in good condition , came out glowing like a bag of banana-flavoured e-numbers because i had spent the weekend catching up on some of my mum 's cooking .
the pheresis machine spins the platelets from the rest of the blood it meant fat was thick in my blood and had attached a globule to each and every platelet , making the medics unable to check their quality , and so the whole lot was useless .
i felt terrible and vowed my dietary frugality near donation day would make scrooge 's supper look like a gourmand having a five-star blow-out .
and , with one or two close shaves , that is what has happened since .
so in the past three years or so i have clocked up the equivalent of 100 donations of blood .
this three-figure total has been helped along in no small measure because one platelet session is credited as three blood donations .
take away the welsh blood service is happy to do this as a single platelet donation can provide as many platelets as four whole blood donations .
and the computer usually sizes me up for a double !
unlike a full blood donation , my donation uses a platelet pheresis -lrb- from the greek " to take away " or " separate " -rrb- .
it means being hooked up for a little over an hour to something like to a dialysis machine which puts the blood through a centrifuge and spins out the platetlets , leaving the remainder , red cells , white cells , plasma , and so on , to be returned via the same needle .
blood count : donating platelets means the pint equivalents soon mount up and as the blood loss in this process is nowhere near as much as a full blood donation , i can come back for more in as little as three weeks .
so i have made my way to the service 's headquarters in talbot green , a few miles outside cardiff , every three or four weeks or so - holidays , illness and other distractions aside - to do just that .
i guess my motivation is it makes me feel i 'm , in a small way , " doing my bit " .
and of course it has nothing to do with the bragging rights of being a 100-plus blood donor now , is it ?
still less is it anything to do with hoping i can perhaps one day catch up with longer time-served donors who have cranked up as much 700 donations to their name !
there is , however , the realisation that if i did not do it , there might be precious few others to lie on one of the six beds in the clinic , filling its 128 appointment slots each month .
birthdays in wales , 16 hospitals need 10,400 platelet donations each year .
just 6,760 come via platelet pheresis , the rest is pooled from whole blood .
walter kemp keeps watch as nick 's platelets collect in the bag above them yet the guidelines on donating are strict .
i 've been turned away on more than one occasion because i had not recovered enough from a chesty cough or a cold sore on my lip was still on parade at the pre-donation health check .
the rules mean i have no idea who the platelets are going to : male , female , baby , teenager or pensioner .
but i do know that i am occasionally matched with a particular patient and i have been called in specifically to donate for that person .
as it happens , a recent a check-up means i 'm required to have some time out again .
so i 'm missing out on the clinic 's rush to stock up with platelet supplies over christmas and the new year , supplies that would allow some people to go home for a few days .
i wo n't have to stick to the cabbage soup diet quite as closely during this festive period .
but it will still give me second thoughts about what i am eating .
from 5 january , platelet donors will be able to continue to donate after their 66th birthday , and whole blood donors after their 70th , provided they have made a full donation in the previous two years .

so i have made my way to the service 's headquarters in talbot green , a few miles outside cardiff , every three or four weeks or so - holidays , illness and other distractions aside - to do just that .
i guess my motivation is it makes me feel i 'm , in a small way , " doing my bit " .
and of course it has nothing to do with the bragging rights of being a 100-plus blood donor now , is it ?
still less is it anything to do with hoping i can perhaps one day catch up with longer time-served donors who have cranked up as much 700 donations to their name !
there is , however , the realisation that if i did not do it , there might be precious few others to lie on one of the six beds in the clinic , filling its 128 appointment slots each month .
birthdays in wales , 16 hospitals need 10,400 platelet donations each year .
just 6,760 come via platelet pheresis , the rest is pooled from whole blood .
walter kemp keeps watch as nick 's platelets collect in the bag above them yet the guidelines on donating are strict .
i 've been turned away on more than one occasion because i had not recovered enough from a chesty cough or a cold sore on my lip was still on parade at the pre-donation health check .
the rules mean i have no idea who the platelets are going to : male , female , baby , teenager or pensioner .
but i do know that i am occasionally matched with a particular patient and i have been called in specifically to donate for that person .
as it happens , a recent a check-up means i 'm required to have some time out again .
so i 'm missing out on the clinic 's rush to stock up with platelet supplies over christmas and the new year , supplies that would allow some people to go home for a few days .
i wo n't have to stick to the cabbage soup diet quite as closely during this festive period .
but it will still give me second thoughts about what i am eating .
from 5 january , platelet donors will be able to continue to donate after their 66th birthday , and whole blood donors after their 70th , provided they have made a full donation in the previous two years .

the chancellor 's department has rejected a request from the scottish government to spread the cost of the £ 2bn bridge over 20 years .
finance secretary john swinney had asked for special permission from the uk government to pay for the new bridge with cash from future capital budgets .
but the chief secretary to the treasury said this was not a " credible option " .
yvette cooper has suggested alternatives such as building up a big underspend or using a public private partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- .
the scottish government said her suggestions were " ridiculous " .
first minister alex salmond told bbc radio scotland : " what we are proposing is thoroughly sensible and thoroughly credible .
" i 'm not taking no for an answer . "
i am sorry that for ideological reasons they have ruled out using public private partnerships " alastair darling " when we have these productive discussions , he -lsb- the chancellor -rsb- will see the great virtue in our plan to enable scotland to go ahead with this extraordinary capital investment without impinging and forcing a delay on capital projects in edinburgh , for example . "
mr darling explained the reasoning for the refusal to bbc radio scotland 's the business programme .
he said : " firstly there is no doubt that we need a second forth crossing .
" we are happy to work with the scottish government .
" if you are contemplating large projects like this you do need to make choices .
" the scottish government 's no different from any other large organisations .
" i am sorry that for ideological reasons they have ruled out using public private partnerships .
" we will work with the scottish government , but their particular scheme where they were asking to borrow money from budgets which are yet to be allocated over an extremely long period - that 's something that we simply do n't do .
" i think they ought to have been aware of it and they could have found out if they had asked earlier . "
labour msp andy kerr demanded a guarantee from the snp that the new bridge would go ahead .
he said : " it is absolutely essential that we go ahead with the new forth road bridge .
" this is one of scotland 's most important transport links and many thousands of jobs depend on it .
" the snp 's response to the treasury is not good government but bad politics and another example of their incompetence and irresponsibility .
" the onus is on them to find a credible way to pay for the crossing . "
the scottish government now plans to pay for the bridge from existing capital budgets , which means other major public works will have to wait in a queue for funding .
