chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
however , in an appearance at a rally in heidelberg on saturday , merkel said that the lack of interest in the european parliament elections may be because many germans felt alienated from the european union .
" to many citizens , the european institutions seem too remote .
they often only find out about decisions made there when they are converted to national laws in germany , " said merkel .
with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hangs tough despite scandal the main contenders in germany are merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , who are both yoked into the final months of a coalition government ahead of a general election in september .
other parties include the bavarian christian social union , the free democrats , greens and left party .
a total of 32 parties are vying for the european vote in germany on a ballot sheet almost a meter long .
but the vast majority of parties will not pass the five percent hurdle required to enter the european parliament .
in italy , voters went to polls on saturday with a scandal concerning nude photos taken at prime minister silvio berlusconi 's villa fresh in their minds .
berlusconi claimed the timing of the photographs was a smear campaign on the part of the left .
" the electoral results will represent a terrible defeat for this left , which has substituted an electoral programme - which it does n't have - for calumny , " berlusconi said on monday .
low turnout ?
turnout throughout the eu is expected to be mixed , from a predicted low of 14 percent in latvia to a high of 80 percent in malta .
polls in slovakia also predicted a low voter turnout of around 14 percent , while in neighboring czech republic polls were showing an anticipated turnout of about 20 percent .
there is concern that low voter turnout might favor the extreme groups to the right and left .
yet most analysts say that it wo n't be enough to upset the current balance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2009 arcandor executives meet with rival metro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for the german retailer arcandor chief karl gerhard eick and metro 's boss eckhard cordes met on sunday to discuss a possible merger of the two retail giants after chancellor angela merkel dashed hopes for a government bailout . as employees of department stores owned by financially troubled arcandor held sit-ins and vigils on sunday to underscore their concern about the fate of the giant department store , executives from arcandor and metro met to discuss a possible merger .
the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the media last week that aid for arcandor was doubtful merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .
merkel , leader of the governing christian democrats , has recommended that arcandor seek a deal with rival kaufhof or sell off its karstadt assets to german retail conglomerate metro , which has already expressed interest .
asking for aid arcandor announced last friday that it had asked berlin for a government-backed loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- in an attempt to keep the company afloat .
a previous application for government loan guarantees totaling 650 million euros has run into resistance from eu officials .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .
in those elections , 48 percent of danes , 39 percent of finns , and 38 percents of swedes cast their vote .
sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern europeans feel it 's " not their choice " in the czech republic , about a quarter of the country was estimated to have voted during polling on friday and saturday .
in slovakia , preliminary unofficial results showed that about 20 percent of the country cast their ballot on saturday , which would have been far more than a record low of 16.9 per cent five years ago .
results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
sunday 's elections are viewed as a key test for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , ahead of general elections in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 07.06.2009 opinion : the biggest loser of the polls is europe itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has voted and not even half of the electorate bothered to cast their vote .
that 's shameful .
so little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the european union is alarming . the supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world .
but this unique chance does n't seem to matter at all to most europeans .
it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .
as is normally the case , 27 national election campaigns were fought , with little evidence of any specific european election campaigns .
at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .
there seems to be no comprehension of how important the european parliament is in all areas of daily life .
as in previous eu elections , governments are punished with only a few exceptions .
the results of the european elections themselves point towards continuity .
victory for the conservative and center-right parties .
the socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block .
the euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries , but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the european parliament .
even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping , they do not have any major influence .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso has even reason to celebrate .
the conservative politician can remain in office for another five years , because it 's usually the case that the commission president comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament .
in the largest eu member state , germany , it was the same story as in the rest of the eu .
national topics dominated the scene .
the election winners from the conservative cdu , the left party , the liberal fdp and the greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in september .
the election losers , the social democrats , though , dismiss any idea that sunday ’ s outcome will affect the national vote .
it 's the same old story after every election .
but because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for germany 's upcoming national elections .
one thing 's for certain : the election loser is europe , because far too many voters are not interested in european politics . author : bernd riegert editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's shameful .
so little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the european union is alarming . the supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world .
but this unique chance does n't seem to matter at all to most europeans .
it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .
as is normally the case , 27 national election campaigns were fought , with little evidence of any specific european election campaigns .
at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .
there seems to be no comprehension of how important the european parliament is in all areas of daily life .
as in previous eu elections , governments are punished with only a few exceptions .
the results of the european elections themselves point towards continuity .
victory for the conservative and center-right parties .
the socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block .
the euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries , but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the european parliament .
even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping , they do not have any major influence .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso has even reason to celebrate .
the conservative politician can remain in office for another five years , because it 's usually the case that the commission president comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament .
in the largest eu member state , germany , it was the same story as in the rest of the eu .
national topics dominated the scene .
the election winners from the conservative cdu , the left party , the liberal fdp and the greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in september .
the election losers , the social democrats , though , dismiss any idea that sunday ’ s outcome will affect the national vote .
it 's the same old story after every election .
but because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for germany 's upcoming national elections .
one thing 's for certain : the election loser is europe , because far too many voters are not interested in european politics . author : bernd riegert editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2009 arcandor executives meet with rival metro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for the german retailer arcandor chief karl gerhard eick and metro 's boss eckhard cordes met on sunday to discuss a possible merger of the two retail giants after chancellor angela merkel dashed hopes for a government bailout . as employees of department stores owned by financially troubled arcandor held sit-ins and vigils on sunday to underscore their concern about the fate of the giant department store , executives from arcandor and metro met to discuss a possible merger .
the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the media last week that aid for arcandor was doubtful merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .
merkel , leader of the governing christian democrats , has recommended that arcandor seek a deal with rival kaufhof or sell off its karstadt assets to german retail conglomerate metro , which has already expressed interest .
asking for aid arcandor announced last friday that it had asked berlin for a government-backed loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- in an attempt to keep the company afloat .
a previous application for government loan guarantees totaling 650 million euros has run into resistance from eu officials .
essen-based arcandor says it needs a loan to keep it on its feet for the next six months .
the money , it 's hoping , could be issued by the state-owned kfw development bank. gb / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.06.2009 citizens make their way to polls in european parliament elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of europe 's 375 million citizens are expected to vote voter turnout has plagued european parliament elections since its inception in 1979 .
opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .
in those elections , 48 percent of danes , 39 percent of finns , and 38 percents of swedes cast their vote .
sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern europeans feel it 's " not their choice " in the czech republic , about a quarter of the country was estimated to have voted during polling on friday and saturday .
in slovakia , preliminary unofficial results showed that about 20 percent of the country cast their ballot on saturday , which would have been far more than a record low of 16.9 per cent five years ago .
results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .
in those elections , 48 percent of danes , 39 percent of finns , and 38 percents of swedes cast their vote .
sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .

results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2009 arcandor executives meet with rival metro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for the german retailer arcandor chief karl gerhard eick and metro 's boss eckhard cordes met on sunday to discuss a possible merger of the two retail giants after chancellor angela merkel dashed hopes for a government bailout . as employees of department stores owned by financially troubled arcandor held sit-ins and vigils on sunday to underscore their concern about the fate of the giant department store , executives from arcandor and metro met to discuss a possible merger .
the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 07.06.2009 the venice biennale opens with top honors for a german artist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehberger posing with biennale curator daniel birnbaum at the awards ceremony the 53rd venice biennale opened its doors to the public on sunday , inviting art enthusiasts to view an extravagant collection of what organizers have billed as " a wide , multi-dimensional world of contemporary creations . " the venerable international art exhibition got under way saturday evening in the fabled northern italian city with an awards ceremony which saw a german , tobias rehberger , a professor at frankfurt 's staedelschule , taking top honors for best artist .
rehberger won the golden lion award for his work " what you love also makes you cry " .
the 43-year-old artist from esslingen near stuttgart designed the cafeteria in the central biennale pavillion , which functions both as a restaruant and a multi-facetted artwork .
the usa pavillion won the golden lion for best national contribution with an installation by conceptual artist , bruce nauman , called " topological gardens " .
this year 's silver lion for the best young artist went to the 35-year-old video and animation artist , nathalie djurberg , of sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoko ono was honored for her career achievements career golden lions were bestowed on avantgarde pioneers yoko ono of japan for her trailblazing performance art and on 78-year-old american , john baldessari , as one of the most important contributors to contemporary concept and video art .
praising the extraordinarily wide range of exhibits and installations , daniel birnbaum , the swedish director of the biennale , told press that " we now live in a totally multi-centric art world . " " a work of art is more than an object , more than a commodity , " he said , " it represents a vision of the world , and if taken seriously , must be seen as a way of making a world . "
birnbaum has been rector at the german staedelschule in frankfurt am main since 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist liam gillick is germany 's rep clean cut modernity while german artists may be bringing in top honors , this year 's german pavilion was designed by a british artist .
liam gillick is the first non-german to have the honor of a solo exhibition in the space .
in 1993 , south-korean born american artist nam june paik displayed together with german hans haacke .
the two won the golden lion for their work .
" what i have always like about the way it is done in germany , is that the curator is given a lot of freedom , " gillick said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the decision as to who the artist should be is not a political decision .
it is coming from a specialist who is an expert in the field . " nicolaus schafhausen was chosen to curate germany 's space for the second time this year .
bildunterschrift : " how are you going to behave ?
a kitchen cat speaks " is the name of gillick 's piece gillick 's work has changed the german pavilion into what appears to be a stringent , bare kitchen - a possible reference to the iconic frankfurter kitchen .
gillick likens the kitchen to something " between ikea and something much more modern . "

chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
however , in an appearance at a rally in heidelberg on saturday , merkel said that the lack of interest in the european parliament elections may be because many germans felt alienated from the european union .
" to many citizens , the european institutions seem too remote .
they often only find out about decisions made there when they are converted to national laws in germany , " said merkel .
with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hangs tough despite scandal the main contenders in germany are merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , who are both yoked into the final months of a coalition government ahead of a general election in september .

in italy , voters went to polls on saturday with a scandal concerning nude photos taken at prime minister silvio berlusconi 's villa fresh in their minds .
berlusconi claimed the timing of the photographs was a smear campaign on the part of the left .
" the electoral results will represent a terrible defeat for this left , which has substituted an electoral programme - which it does n't have - for calumny , " berlusconi said on monday .

turnout throughout the eu is expected to be mixed , from a predicted low of 14 percent in latvia to a high of 80 percent in malta .

there is concern that low voter turnout might favor the extreme groups to the right and left .
yet most analysts say that it wo n't be enough to upset the current balance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2009 arcandor executives meet with rival metro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for the german retailer arcandor chief karl gerhard eick and metro 's boss eckhard cordes met on sunday to discuss a possible merger of the two retail giants after chancellor angela merkel dashed hopes for a government bailout . as employees of department stores owned by financially troubled arcandor held sit-ins and vigils on sunday to underscore their concern about the fate of the giant department store , executives from arcandor and metro met to discuss a possible merger .
the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the media last week that aid for arcandor was doubtful merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .
merkel , leader of the governing christian democrats , has recommended that arcandor seek a deal with rival kaufhof or sell off its karstadt assets to german retail conglomerate metro , which has already expressed interest .
asking for aid arcandor announced last friday that it had asked berlin for a government-backed loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- in an attempt to keep the company afloat .
a previous application for government loan guarantees totaling 650 million euros has run into resistance from eu officials .
essen-based arcandor says it needs a loan to keep it on its feet for the next six months .
the money , it 's hoping , could be issued by the state-owned kfw development bank. gb / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's shameful .
so little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the european union is alarming . the supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world .
but this unique chance does n't seem to matter at all to most europeans .
it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .
as is normally the case , 27 national election campaigns were fought , with little evidence of any specific european election campaigns .
at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .
there seems to be no comprehension of how important the european parliament is in all areas of daily life .
as in previous eu elections , governments are punished with only a few exceptions .
the results of the european elections themselves point towards continuity .
victory for the conservative and center-right parties .
the socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block .
the euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries , but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the european parliament .
even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping , they do not have any major influence .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso has even reason to celebrate .
the conservative politician can remain in office for another five years , because it 's usually the case that the commission president comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament .
in the largest eu member state , germany , it was the same story as in the rest of the eu .
national topics dominated the scene .
the election winners from the conservative cdu , the left party , the liberal fdp and the greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in september .
the election losers , the social democrats , though , dismiss any idea that sunday ’ s outcome will affect the national vote .
it 's the same old story after every election .
but because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for germany 's upcoming national elections .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .
in those elections , 48 percent of danes , 39 percent of finns , and 38 percents of swedes cast their vote .
sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern europeans feel it 's " not their choice " in the czech republic , about a quarter of the country was estimated to have voted during polling on friday and saturday .
in slovakia , preliminary unofficial results showed that about 20 percent of the country cast their ballot on saturday , which would have been far more than a record low of 16.9 per cent five years ago .
results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
sunday 's elections are viewed as a key test for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , ahead of general elections in september .

this comes as the nation 's mps are facing an expenses scandal that shocked the country two weeks ago .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .

sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .

results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .

the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the media last week that aid for arcandor was doubtful merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .
merkel , leader of the governing christian democrats , has recommended that arcandor seek a deal with rival kaufhof or sell off its karstadt assets to german retail conglomerate metro , which has already expressed interest .
asking for aid arcandor announced last friday that it had asked berlin for a government-backed loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- in an attempt to keep the company afloat .
a previous application for government loan guarantees totaling 650 million euros has run into resistance from eu officials .

it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .

at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .

that 's shameful .
so little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the european union is alarming . the supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world .
but this unique chance does n't seem to matter at all to most europeans .
it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .
as is normally the case , 27 national election campaigns were fought , with little evidence of any specific european election campaigns .
at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .
there seems to be no comprehension of how important the european parliament is in all areas of daily life .
as in previous eu elections , governments are punished with only a few exceptions .
the results of the european elections themselves point towards continuity .
victory for the conservative and center-right parties .
the socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block .
the euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries , but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the european parliament .
even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping , they do not have any major influence .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso has even reason to celebrate .
the conservative politician can remain in office for another five years , because it 's usually the case that the commission president comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament .
in the largest eu member state , germany , it was the same story as in the rest of the eu .
national topics dominated the scene .
the election winners from the conservative cdu , the left party , the liberal fdp and the greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in september .
the election losers , the social democrats , though , dismiss any idea that sunday ’ s outcome will affect the national vote .
it 's the same old story after every election .
but because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for germany 's upcoming national elections .
one thing 's for certain : the election loser is europe , because far too many voters are not interested in european politics . author : bernd riegert editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
however , in an appearance at a rally in heidelberg on saturday , merkel said that the lack of interest in the european parliament elections may be because many germans felt alienated from the european union .
" to many citizens , the european institutions seem too remote .

low turnout ?
turnout throughout the eu is expected to be mixed , from a predicted low of 14 percent in latvia to a high of 80 percent in malta .
polls in slovakia also predicted a low voter turnout of around 14 percent , while in neighboring czech republic polls were showing an anticipated turnout of about 20 percent .
there is concern that low voter turnout might favor the extreme groups to the right and left .
yet most analysts say that it wo n't be enough to upset the current balance .

chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
however , in an appearance at a rally in heidelberg on saturday , merkel said that the lack of interest in the european parliament elections may be because many germans felt alienated from the european union .
" to many citizens , the european institutions seem too remote .
they often only find out about decisions made there when they are converted to national laws in germany , " said merkel .
with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hangs tough despite scandal the main contenders in germany are merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , who are both yoked into the final months of a coalition government ahead of a general election in september .
other parties include the bavarian christian social union , the free democrats , greens and left party .
a total of 32 parties are vying for the european vote in germany on a ballot sheet almost a meter long .
but the vast majority of parties will not pass the five percent hurdle required to enter the european parliament .
in italy , voters went to polls on saturday with a scandal concerning nude photos taken at prime minister silvio berlusconi 's villa fresh in their minds .
berlusconi claimed the timing of the photographs was a smear campaign on the part of the left .
" the electoral results will represent a terrible defeat for this left , which has substituted an electoral programme - which it does n't have - for calumny , " berlusconi said on monday .
low turnout ?
turnout throughout the eu is expected to be mixed , from a predicted low of 14 percent in latvia to a high of 80 percent in malta .
polls in slovakia also predicted a low voter turnout of around 14 percent , while in neighboring czech republic polls were showing an anticipated turnout of about 20 percent .
there is concern that low voter turnout might favor the extreme groups to the right and left .
yet most analysts say that it wo n't be enough to upset the current balance .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .

sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .

results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 07.06.2009 opinion : the biggest loser of the polls is europe itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has voted and not even half of the electorate bothered to cast their vote .
that 's shameful .
so little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the european union is alarming . the supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world .
but this unique chance does n't seem to matter at all to most europeans .
it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .
as is normally the case , 27 national election campaigns were fought , with little evidence of any specific european election campaigns .
at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .
there seems to be no comprehension of how important the european parliament is in all areas of daily life .
as in previous eu elections , governments are punished with only a few exceptions .
the results of the european elections themselves point towards continuity .
victory for the conservative and center-right parties .
the socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block .
the euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries , but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the european parliament .
even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping , they do not have any major influence .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso has even reason to celebrate .
the conservative politician can remain in office for another five years , because it 's usually the case that the commission president comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament .
in the largest eu member state , germany , it was the same story as in the rest of the eu .
national topics dominated the scene .
the election winners from the conservative cdu , the left party , the liberal fdp and the greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in september .
the election losers , the social democrats , though , dismiss any idea that sunday ’ s outcome will affect the national vote .
it 's the same old story after every election .
but because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for germany 's upcoming national elections .
one thing 's for certain : the election loser is europe , because far too many voters are not interested in european politics . author : bernd riegert editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
however , in an appearance at a rally in heidelberg on saturday , merkel said that the lack of interest in the european parliament elections may be because many germans felt alienated from the european union .
" to many citizens , the european institutions seem too remote .
they often only find out about decisions made there when they are converted to national laws in germany , " said merkel .
with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hangs tough despite scandal the main contenders in germany are merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , who are both yoked into the final months of a coalition government ahead of a general election in september .

a total of 32 parties are vying for the european vote in germany on a ballot sheet almost a meter long .
but the vast majority of parties will not pass the five percent hurdle required to enter the european parliament .
in italy , voters went to polls on saturday with a scandal concerning nude photos taken at prime minister silvio berlusconi 's villa fresh in their minds .
berlusconi claimed the timing of the photographs was a smear campaign on the part of the left .
" the electoral results will represent a terrible defeat for this left , which has substituted an electoral programme - which it does n't have - for calumny , " berlusconi said on monday .
low turnout ?
turnout throughout the eu is expected to be mixed , from a predicted low of 14 percent in latvia to a high of 80 percent in malta .
polls in slovakia also predicted a low voter turnout of around 14 percent , while in neighboring czech republic polls were showing an anticipated turnout of about 20 percent .
there is concern that low voter turnout might favor the extreme groups to the right and left .

with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hangs tough despite scandal the main contenders in germany are merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , who are both yoked into the final months of a coalition government ahead of a general election in september .
other parties include the bavarian christian social union , the free democrats , greens and left party .
a total of 32 parties are vying for the european vote in germany on a ballot sheet almost a meter long .
but the vast majority of parties will not pass the five percent hurdle required to enter the european parliament .
in italy , voters went to polls on saturday with a scandal concerning nude photos taken at prime minister silvio berlusconi 's villa fresh in their minds .
berlusconi claimed the timing of the photographs was a smear campaign on the part of the left .
" the electoral results will represent a terrible defeat for this left , which has substituted an electoral programme - which it does n't have - for calumny , " berlusconi said on monday .
low turnout ?
turnout throughout the eu is expected to be mixed , from a predicted low of 14 percent in latvia to a high of 80 percent in malta .
polls in slovakia also predicted a low voter turnout of around 14 percent , while in neighboring czech republic polls were showing an anticipated turnout of about 20 percent .
there is concern that low voter turnout might favor the extreme groups to the right and left .
yet most analysts say that it wo n't be enough to upset the current balance .

" the venerable international art exhibition got under way saturday evening in the fabled northern italian city with an awards ceremony which saw a german , tobias rehberger , a professor at frankfurt 's staedelschule , taking top honors for best artist .
rehberger won the golden lion award for his work " what you love also makes you cry " .
the 43-year-old artist from esslingen near stuttgart designed the cafeteria in the central biennale pavillion , which functions both as a restaruant and a multi-facetted artwork .
the usa pavillion won the golden lion for best national contribution with an installation by conceptual artist , bruce nauman , called " topological gardens " .
this year 's silver lion for the best young artist went to the 35-year-old video and animation artist , nathalie djurberg , of sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoko ono was honored for her career achievements career golden lions were bestowed on avantgarde pioneers yoko ono of japan for her trailblazing performance art and on 78-year-old american , john baldessari , as one of the most important contributors to contemporary concept and video art .
praising the extraordinarily wide range of exhibits and installations , daniel birnbaum , the swedish director of the biennale , told press that " we now live in a totally multi-centric art world . " " a work of art is more than an object , more than a commodity , " he said , " it represents a vision of the world , and if taken seriously , must be seen as a way of making a world . "
birnbaum has been rector at the german staedelschule in frankfurt am main since 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist liam gillick is germany 's rep clean cut modernity while german artists may be bringing in top honors , this year 's german pavilion was designed by a british artist .
liam gillick is the first non-german to have the honor of a solo exhibition in the space .
in 1993 , south-korean born american artist nam june paik displayed together with german hans haacke .
the two won the golden lion for their work .
" what i have always like about the way it is done in germany , is that the curator is given a lot of freedom , " gillick said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the decision as to who the artist should be is not a political decision .
it is coming from a specialist who is an expert in the field . " nicolaus schafhausen was chosen to curate germany 's space for the second time this year .
bildunterschrift : " how are you going to behave ?
a kitchen cat speaks " is the name of gillick 's piece gillick 's work has changed the german pavilion into what appears to be a stringent , bare kitchen - a possible reference to the iconic frankfurter kitchen .
gillick likens the kitchen to something " between ikea and something much more modern . "
" it is a kind of alternative modernity .
it is not about grand symbolism , it is not about over-reaching ideology .
it is that other modernism , the one that leads to the contemporary kitchen in a way , " he said .
the biennale this year features 90 artists from 77 countries and runs through november 22. gb / dpa / afp / dw editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 07.06.2009 opinion : the biggest loser of the polls is europe itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has voted and not even half of the electorate bothered to cast their vote .
that 's shameful .
so little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the european union is alarming . the supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world .
but this unique chance does n't seem to matter at all to most europeans .
it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .
as is normally the case , 27 national election campaigns were fought , with little evidence of any specific european election campaigns .
at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .
there seems to be no comprehension of how important the european parliament is in all areas of daily life .
as in previous eu elections , governments are punished with only a few exceptions .
the results of the european elections themselves point towards continuity .
victory for the conservative and center-right parties .
the socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block .
the euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries , but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the european parliament .
even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping , they do not have any major influence .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso has even reason to celebrate .
the conservative politician can remain in office for another five years , because it 's usually the case that the commission president comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament .
in the largest eu member state , germany , it was the same story as in the rest of the eu .
national topics dominated the scene .
the election winners from the conservative cdu , the left party , the liberal fdp and the greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in september .
the election losers , the social democrats , though , dismiss any idea that sunday ’ s outcome will affect the national vote .
it 's the same old story after every election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2009 arcandor executives meet with rival metro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for the german retailer arcandor chief karl gerhard eick and metro 's boss eckhard cordes met on sunday to discuss a possible merger of the two retail giants after chancellor angela merkel dashed hopes for a government bailout . as employees of department stores owned by financially troubled arcandor held sit-ins and vigils on sunday to underscore their concern about the fate of the giant department store , executives from arcandor and metro met to discuss a possible merger .
the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the media last week that aid for arcandor was doubtful merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .
merkel , leader of the governing christian democrats , has recommended that arcandor seek a deal with rival kaufhof or sell off its karstadt assets to german retail conglomerate metro , which has already expressed interest .
asking for aid arcandor announced last friday that it had asked berlin for a government-backed loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- in an attempt to keep the company afloat .
a previous application for government loan guarantees totaling 650 million euros has run into resistance from eu officials .
essen-based arcandor says it needs a loan to keep it on its feet for the next six months .
the money , it 's hoping , could be issued by the state-owned kfw development bank. gb / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .

sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .

results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .

sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .

results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .

the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .

" the venerable international art exhibition got under way saturday evening in the fabled northern italian city with an awards ceremony which saw a german , tobias rehberger , a professor at frankfurt 's staedelschule , taking top honors for best artist .
rehberger won the golden lion award for his work " what you love also makes you cry " .
the 43-year-old artist from esslingen near stuttgart designed the cafeteria in the central biennale pavillion , which functions both as a restaruant and a multi-facetted artwork .
the usa pavillion won the golden lion for best national contribution with an installation by conceptual artist , bruce nauman , called " topological gardens " .
this year 's silver lion for the best young artist went to the 35-year-old video and animation artist , nathalie djurberg , of sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoko ono was honored for her career achievements career golden lions were bestowed on avantgarde pioneers yoko ono of japan for her trailblazing performance art and on 78-year-old american , john baldessari , as one of the most important contributors to contemporary concept and video art .
praising the extraordinarily wide range of exhibits and installations , daniel birnbaum , the swedish director of the biennale , told press that " we now live in a totally multi-centric art world . " " a work of art is more than an object , more than a commodity , " he said , " it represents a vision of the world , and if taken seriously , must be seen as a way of making a world . "
birnbaum has been rector at the german staedelschule in frankfurt am main since 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist liam gillick is germany 's rep clean cut modernity while german artists may be bringing in top honors , this year 's german pavilion was designed by a british artist .
liam gillick is the first non-german to have the honor of a solo exhibition in the space .
in 1993 , south-korean born american artist nam june paik displayed together with german hans haacke .
the two won the golden lion for their work .
" what i have always like about the way it is done in germany , is that the curator is given a lot of freedom , " gillick said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the decision as to who the artist should be is not a political decision .
it is coming from a specialist who is an expert in the field . " nicolaus schafhausen was chosen to curate germany 's space for the second time this year .
bildunterschrift : " how are you going to behave ?
a kitchen cat speaks " is the name of gillick 's piece gillick 's work has changed the german pavilion into what appears to be a stringent , bare kitchen - a possible reference to the iconic frankfurter kitchen .
gillick likens the kitchen to something " between ikea and something much more modern . "
" it is a kind of alternative modernity .
it is not about grand symbolism , it is not about over-reaching ideology .
it is that other modernism , the one that leads to the contemporary kitchen in a way , " he said .
the biennale this year features 90 artists from 77 countries and runs through november 22. gb / dpa / afp / dw editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .

" the venerable international art exhibition got under way saturday evening in the fabled northern italian city with an awards ceremony which saw a german , tobias rehberger , a professor at frankfurt 's staedelschule , taking top honors for best artist .
rehberger won the golden lion award for his work " what you love also makes you cry " .
the 43-year-old artist from esslingen near stuttgart designed the cafeteria in the central biennale pavillion , which functions both as a restaruant and a multi-facetted artwork .
the usa pavillion won the golden lion for best national contribution with an installation by conceptual artist , bruce nauman , called " topological gardens " .
this year 's silver lion for the best young artist went to the 35-year-old video and animation artist , nathalie djurberg , of sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoko ono was honored for her career achievements career golden lions were bestowed on avantgarde pioneers yoko ono of japan for her trailblazing performance art and on 78-year-old american , john baldessari , as one of the most important contributors to contemporary concept and video art .
praising the extraordinarily wide range of exhibits and installations , daniel birnbaum , the swedish director of the biennale , told press that " we now live in a totally multi-centric art world . " " a work of art is more than an object , more than a commodity , " he said , " it represents a vision of the world , and if taken seriously , must be seen as a way of making a world . "
birnbaum has been rector at the german staedelschule in frankfurt am main since 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist liam gillick is germany 's rep clean cut modernity while german artists may be bringing in top honors , this year 's german pavilion was designed by a british artist .
liam gillick is the first non-german to have the honor of a solo exhibition in the space .
in 1993 , south-korean born american artist nam june paik displayed together with german hans haacke .
the two won the golden lion for their work .
" what i have always like about the way it is done in germany , is that the curator is given a lot of freedom , " gillick said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the decision as to who the artist should be is not a political decision .
it is coming from a specialist who is an expert in the field . " nicolaus schafhausen was chosen to curate germany 's space for the second time this year .
bildunterschrift : " how are you going to behave ?
a kitchen cat speaks " is the name of gillick 's piece gillick 's work has changed the german pavilion into what appears to be a stringent , bare kitchen - a possible reference to the iconic frankfurter kitchen .
gillick likens the kitchen to something " between ikea and something much more modern . "
" it is a kind of alternative modernity .
it is not about grand symbolism , it is not about over-reaching ideology .
it is that other modernism , the one that leads to the contemporary kitchen in a way , " he said .

chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
however , in an appearance at a rally in heidelberg on saturday , merkel said that the lack of interest in the european parliament elections may be because many germans felt alienated from the european union .
" to many citizens , the european institutions seem too remote .
they often only find out about decisions made there when they are converted to national laws in germany , " said merkel .
with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hangs tough despite scandal the main contenders in germany are merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , who are both yoked into the final months of a coalition government ahead of a general election in september .
other parties include the bavarian christian social union , the free democrats , greens and left party .
a total of 32 parties are vying for the european vote in germany on a ballot sheet almost a meter long .
but the vast majority of parties will not pass the five percent hurdle required to enter the european parliament .
in italy , voters went to polls on saturday with a scandal concerning nude photos taken at prime minister silvio berlusconi 's villa fresh in their minds .
berlusconi claimed the timing of the photographs was a smear campaign on the part of the left .
" the electoral results will represent a terrible defeat for this left , which has substituted an electoral programme - which it does n't have - for calumny , " berlusconi said on monday .
low turnout ?
turnout throughout the eu is expected to be mixed , from a predicted low of 14 percent in latvia to a high of 80 percent in malta .
polls in slovakia also predicted a low voter turnout of around 14 percent , while in neighboring czech republic polls were showing an anticipated turnout of about 20 percent .
there is concern that low voter turnout might favor the extreme groups to the right and left .
yet most analysts say that it wo n't be enough to upset the current balance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2009 arcandor executives meet with rival metro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for the german retailer arcandor chief karl gerhard eick and metro 's boss eckhard cordes met on sunday to discuss a possible merger of the two retail giants after chancellor angela merkel dashed hopes for a government bailout . as employees of department stores owned by financially troubled arcandor held sit-ins and vigils on sunday to underscore their concern about the fate of the giant department store , executives from arcandor and metro met to discuss a possible merger .
the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the media last week that aid for arcandor was doubtful merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .
merkel , leader of the governing christian democrats , has recommended that arcandor seek a deal with rival kaufhof or sell off its karstadt assets to german retail conglomerate metro , which has already expressed interest .
asking for aid arcandor announced last friday that it had asked berlin for a government-backed loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- in an attempt to keep the company afloat .
a previous application for government loan guarantees totaling 650 million euros has run into resistance from eu officials .
essen-based arcandor says it needs a loan to keep it on its feet for the next six months .
the money , it 's hoping , could be issued by the state-owned kfw development bank. gb / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel urged voters to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
however , in an appearance at a rally in heidelberg on saturday , merkel said that the lack of interest in the european parliament elections may be because many germans felt alienated from the european union .
" to many citizens , the european institutions seem too remote .
they often only find out about decisions made there when they are converted to national laws in germany , " said merkel .
with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi hangs tough despite scandal the main contenders in germany are merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , who are both yoked into the final months of a coalition government ahead of a general election in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2009 arcandor executives meet with rival metro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for the german retailer arcandor chief karl gerhard eick and metro 's boss eckhard cordes met on sunday to discuss a possible merger of the two retail giants after chancellor angela merkel dashed hopes for a government bailout . as employees of department stores owned by financially troubled arcandor held sit-ins and vigils on sunday to underscore their concern about the fate of the giant department store , executives from arcandor and metro met to discuss a possible merger .
the urgency of the situation increased markedly after german chancellor indicated in the press that government help was unlikely .
" i find it unacceptable that people call on the state for help when they themselves must do something , " said merkel to the bild daily newspaper over the weekend .
employees express their concerns at the group 's karstadt department store in wismar , in northern germany , protesters gathered signatures from passers-by and symbolically occupied the building in a final effort to save their jobs .
similar action was planned for other locations throughout germany .
the 11th-hour protests come as arcandor prepares to file for bankruptcy as early as monday , if it does not receive an emergency line of credit from the german government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt employees in wismar are hoping arcandor can save their jobs german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , has planned a meeting for monday between the mayors of the affected cities and arcandor executives .
one of the key issues under discussion will be possible aid from an existing urban planning fund .
" department stores make our inner-cities attractive .
if they go , city centers are no longer a magnet , " tiefensee said .
still more questions than answers german chancellor angela merkel , on the other hand , has said she is against offering the beleaguered retailer a bailout with state aid and has demanded that the owners of the german department store karstadt , the mail order house quelle and the thomas cook travel agencies answer a few questions first .
" i do n't understand at all why some members of the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag newspaper last week , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the media last week that aid for arcandor was doubtful merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .
merkel , leader of the governing christian democrats , has recommended that arcandor seek a deal with rival kaufhof or sell off its karstadt assets to german retail conglomerate metro , which has already expressed interest .
asking for aid arcandor announced last friday that it had asked berlin for a government-backed loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 620 million -rrb- in an attempt to keep the company afloat .
a previous application for government loan guarantees totaling 650 million euros has run into resistance from eu officials .
essen-based arcandor says it needs a loan to keep it on its feet for the next six months .
the money , it 's hoping , could be issued by the state-owned kfw development bank. gb / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.06.2009 citizens make their way to polls in european parliament elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of europe 's 375 million citizens are expected to vote voter turnout has plagued european parliament elections since its inception in 1979 .
opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .
in those elections , 48 percent of danes , 39 percent of finns , and 38 percents of swedes cast their vote .
sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .

that 's shameful .
so little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the european union is alarming . the supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world .
but this unique chance does n't seem to matter at all to most europeans .
it 's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle , european politicians are also largely to blame .
as is normally the case , 27 national election campaigns were fought , with little evidence of any specific european election campaigns .
at home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in brussels , although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at eu level .
in eastern europe 's younger democracies the situation is even worse .
there seems to be no comprehension of how important the european parliament is in all areas of daily life .
as in previous eu elections , governments are punished with only a few exceptions .
the results of the european elections themselves point towards continuity .
victory for the conservative and center-right parties .
the socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block .
the euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries , but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the european parliament .
even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping , they do not have any major influence .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso has even reason to celebrate .
the conservative politician can remain in office for another five years , because it 's usually the case that the commission president comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament .
in the largest eu member state , germany , it was the same story as in the rest of the eu .
national topics dominated the scene .
the election winners from the conservative cdu , the left party , the liberal fdp and the greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in september .
the election losers , the social democrats , though , dismiss any idea that sunday ’ s outcome will affect the national vote .
it 's the same old story after every election .
but because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for germany 's upcoming national elections .
one thing 's for certain : the election loser is europe , because far too many voters are not interested in european politics . author : bernd riegert editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .
in those elections , 48 percent of danes , 39 percent of finns , and 38 percents of swedes cast their vote .
sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern europeans feel it 's " not their choice " in the czech republic , about a quarter of the country was estimated to have voted during polling on friday and saturday .
in slovakia , preliminary unofficial results showed that about 20 percent of the country cast their ballot on saturday , which would have been far more than a record low of 16.9 per cent five years ago .
results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
sunday 's elections are viewed as a key test for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , ahead of general elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi is standing strong in the face of scandal in italy , the vote is seen as a popularity test for prime minister silvio berlusconi in the wake of a scandal involving his ambiguous relationship with an 18-year-old woman .
in great britain , where citizens voted on thursday , results have been predicted to deal a blow to prime minister gordon brown 's governing labour party .
this comes as the nation 's mps are facing an expenses scandal that shocked the country two weeks ago .
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is widely predicted to defeat the opposition socialist party in spite of growing social discontent and rising unemployment .
with the eu suffering from its worst recession in decades , analysts were also keeping a close eye on the performance of extremist parties on both the far left and far right of the political divide throughout europe. glb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the venerable international art exhibition got under way saturday evening in the fabled northern italian city with an awards ceremony which saw a german , tobias rehberger , a professor at frankfurt 's staedelschule , taking top honors for best artist .
rehberger won the golden lion award for his work " what you love also makes you cry " .
the 43-year-old artist from esslingen near stuttgart designed the cafeteria in the central biennale pavillion , which functions both as a restaruant and a multi-facetted artwork .
the usa pavillion won the golden lion for best national contribution with an installation by conceptual artist , bruce nauman , called " topological gardens " .
this year 's silver lion for the best young artist went to the 35-year-old video and animation artist , nathalie djurberg , of sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoko ono was honored for her career achievements career golden lions were bestowed on avantgarde pioneers yoko ono of japan for her trailblazing performance art and on 78-year-old american , john baldessari , as one of the most important contributors to contemporary concept and video art .
praising the extraordinarily wide range of exhibits and installations , daniel birnbaum , the swedish director of the biennale , told press that " we now live in a totally multi-centric art world . " " a work of art is more than an object , more than a commodity , " he said , " it represents a vision of the world , and if taken seriously , must be seen as a way of making a world . "
birnbaum has been rector at the german staedelschule in frankfurt am main since 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist liam gillick is germany 's rep clean cut modernity while german artists may be bringing in top honors , this year 's german pavilion was designed by a british artist .
liam gillick is the first non-german to have the honor of a solo exhibition in the space .
in 1993 , south-korean born american artist nam june paik displayed together with german hans haacke .
the two won the golden lion for their work .
" what i have always like about the way it is done in germany , is that the curator is given a lot of freedom , " gillick said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the decision as to who the artist should be is not a political decision .
it is coming from a specialist who is an expert in the field . " nicolaus schafhausen was chosen to curate germany 's space for the second time this year .
bildunterschrift : " how are you going to behave ?
a kitchen cat speaks " is the name of gillick 's piece gillick 's work has changed the german pavilion into what appears to be a stringent , bare kitchen - a possible reference to the iconic frankfurter kitchen .
gillick likens the kitchen to something " between ikea and something much more modern . "
" it is a kind of alternative modernity .
it is not about grand symbolism , it is not about over-reaching ideology .
it is that other modernism , the one that leads to the contemporary kitchen in a way , " he said .
the biennale this year features 90 artists from 77 countries and runs through november 22. gb / dpa / afp / dw editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.06.2009 citizens make their way to polls in european parliament elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of europe 's 375 million citizens are expected to vote voter turnout has plagued european parliament elections since its inception in 1979 .
opinion polls suggested an all-time low turnout for this year , but initial reports in some countries contradict those figures . despite its growing influence and power across europe , europeans have shown little interest in the european parliament since it was established 30 years ago .
the turnout rate has fallen steadily over the years - from a peak of 63 percent in 1979 , to just over 45 percent five years ago .
surveys and preliminary estimates suggest that just under half of the eu 's 375 million eligible voters will make their way to polling stations this year .
more interest shown in france , scandinavia , less in germany however , interior ministry reports from paris show that more people voted in france on sunday than in the 2004 election .
as of noon , almost 15 percent of france 's 44 million eligible voters had cast their ballots , compared to 13.7 percent at the same time in 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer germans turned out sunday morning than five years ago meanwhile , in denmark , finland and sweden initial reports likewise indicate a higher voter turnout than in 2004 .
in those elections , 48 percent of danes , 39 percent of finns , and 38 percents of swedes cast their vote .
sunday morning 's turnout showed to be sluggish across germany , the most populous state in the european union .
in six of germany 's 16 states , where weather conditions were mostly cool and overcast , a lower turnout was recorded on sunday morning compared with initial figures in 2004 .
especially low turnout in eastern europe polls also opened in bulgaria , estonia , hungary , lithuania , poland , romania and slovenia on sunday , while czechs , latvians and slovaks finished voting on saturday .
slovaks and czechs appeared to have had little interest in the european election , while a turnout of more than 50 percent was reported in latvia .
many are saying this surge of interest was caused by a mayoral election taking place on the same day as the european parliament vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern europeans feel it 's " not their choice " in the czech republic , about a quarter of the country was estimated to have voted during polling on friday and saturday .
in slovakia , preliminary unofficial results showed that about 20 percent of the country cast their ballot on saturday , which would have been far more than a record low of 16.9 per cent five years ago .
results significant for national politics in germany , where polls opened at 8am on sunday , voters have a chance to elect 99 deputies to the european parliament .
chancellor angela merkel urged voters leading up the election to go to the polls and make their voices heard .
sunday 's elections are viewed as a key test for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , ahead of general elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi is standing strong in the face of scandal in italy , the vote is seen as a popularity test for prime minister silvio berlusconi in the wake of a scandal involving his ambiguous relationship with an 18-year-old woman .
in great britain , where citizens voted on thursday , results have been predicted to deal a blow to prime minister gordon brown 's governing labour party .
this comes as the nation 's mps are facing an expenses scandal that shocked the country two weeks ago .
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is widely predicted to defeat the opposition socialist party in spite of growing social discontent and rising unemployment .
with the eu suffering from its worst recession in decades , analysts were also keeping a close eye on the performance of extremist parties on both the far left and far right of the political divide throughout europe. glb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by peter jackson bbc news a high-rise tower for animals in the industrial heartland of leeds is offering a unique solution to the decline of urban wildlife .
can it work ?
rising 40 feet -lrb- 12 metres -rrb- above canals once lined with textile mills and factory chimneys could soon be another kind of tower - a high-rise for all creatures great and -lrb- mainly -rrb- small .
if the plans come to fruition , the structure aims to encourage a variety of species to " reclaim their urban landscape " .
it is the vision of a small team of architects , a vertical solution to a horizontal desire to offer shelter to creatures in urban areas where space on the ground is tight .
the man behind the project , 26-year-old neil oxlee , hopes his " man-made tree " will provide a habitat for bats , birds , butterflies , insects and even foxes .
house proud : neil oxlee 's design beat entries from around the world he says the different species would thrive off each other like they would in a woodland environment , with minimal human involvement .
" i 'm not an animal expert , if it goes further we 'd need to get a wildlife expert on board ... to see exactly which ones eat the other ones .
there 's a food chain there .
" it would evolve from there ... there may be a few extra design factors to take into account .
this is a concept . "
mr oxlee 's towers - to be built from recycled materials - draw inspiration from three nearby italianate towers which are 200 years old and stand 80 feet -lrb- 25m -rrb- tall .
' striking design ' the design , by garnett netherwood architects , beat more than 30 entries in a competition run by holbeck urban village , a business community backed by leeds city council .
the towers are a brilliant idea , says wildlife presenter chris packham organisers say they launched the competition because bird song has all but vanished from many cities and towns and wildlife generally is in decline .
marketing officer leanne buchan says the " village " community wanted to respect the bio-diversity of the area during its regeneration .
otters have returned to the area for the first time in 30 years and she hopes to see butterflies , bats and bees plus swifts , house martins and other nesting birds , attracted by raised beds .
" we went on tour with a conservation officer to see what wildlife to invite in and sustain once here , and what was needed from the habitat , " she says .
" part of it is for people to enjoy the wildlife around them , but it 's more about taking responsibility for things ... to safeguard it for future generations . "
the winning tower design would be " striking " , she says , and could well become an iconic piece of architecture .
the urban wildlife squeeze swifts , house martins and collard doves fell 15 % from 1994 to 2006 - house sparrows by a third allotments - valuable green spaces in urban areas - have declined by 80 % in 50 years the natterjack toad is found at only 50 sites in england , a fall of 80 % in the last century the small tortoiseshell butterfly has declined 81 % between 2003 and 2007 urban land cover in england is projected to rise more than 1 % to 11.9 % by 2016 source : natural england and conservationists will ensure they attracted the right animals and assess whether to fence off the towers .
house sparrow numbers are down 64 % in 25 years , the uk 's 17 species of bat are all now protected by law and there are just 56 butterfly species remaining in britain , figures show .
few know that better than presenter chris packham , who is joining bbc 2 's wildlife programme springwatch .
he thinks the towers are a " brilliant " idea , partly because modern urban houses do n't have holes to double up as nests .
" hopefully there will be room for bats , small nesting birds like great tits or blue tits and insects , " he says .
other towers built for barn owls have managed to also attract kestrels , he adds , and there is no reason why this design should n't work , although it wo n't be to every animal 's liking .

these fantastic tower block designs provide all the needs for an aspiring city dweller peter nottage natural england conservation group natural england believes the " fantastic " design could potentially prove as successful as garden bird boxes , and has offered its expertise to help .
peter nottage , regional director for yorkshire and humber , says wildlife should be recorded before a project goes ahead that could change its balance .

he said those most likely to benefit are nesting birds , with nooks and crannies for insects , and other less mobile animals .

the foxes live on the plant eaters .
without large numbers of them , no meat eaters are possible .

by peter jackson bbc news a high-rise tower for animals in the industrial heartland of leeds is offering a unique solution to the decline of urban wildlife .
can it work ?
rising 40 feet -lrb- 12 metres -rrb- above canals once lined with textile mills and factory chimneys could soon be another kind of tower - a high-rise for all creatures great and -lrb- mainly -rrb- small .
if the plans come to fruition , the structure aims to encourage a variety of species to " reclaim their urban landscape " .
it is the vision of a small team of architects , a vertical solution to a horizontal desire to offer shelter to creatures in urban areas where space on the ground is tight .
the man behind the project , 26-year-old neil oxlee , hopes his " man-made tree " will provide a habitat for bats , birds , butterflies , insects and even foxes .
house proud : neil oxlee 's design beat entries from around the world he says the different species would thrive off each other like they would in a woodland environment , with minimal human involvement .
" i 'm not an animal expert , if it goes further we 'd need to get a wildlife expert on board ... to see exactly which ones eat the other ones .
there 's a food chain there .
" it would evolve from there ... there may be a few extra design factors to take into account .
this is a concept . "
mr oxlee 's towers - to be built from recycled materials - draw inspiration from three nearby italianate towers which are 200 years old and stand 80 feet -lrb- 25m -rrb- tall .
' striking design ' the design , by garnett netherwood architects , beat more than 30 entries in a competition run by holbeck urban village , a business community backed by leeds city council .
the towers are a brilliant idea , says wildlife presenter chris packham organisers say they launched the competition because bird song has all but vanished from many cities and towns and wildlife generally is in decline .
marketing officer leanne buchan says the " village " community wanted to respect the bio-diversity of the area during its regeneration .
otters have returned to the area for the first time in 30 years and she hopes to see butterflies , bats and bees plus swifts , house martins and other nesting birds , attracted by raised beds .
" we went on tour with a conservation officer to see what wildlife to invite in and sustain once here , and what was needed from the habitat , " she says .
" part of it is for people to enjoy the wildlife around them , but it 's more about taking responsibility for things ... to safeguard it for future generations . "
the winning tower design would be " striking " , she says , and could well become an iconic piece of architecture .
the urban wildlife squeeze swifts , house martins and collard doves fell 15 % from 1994 to 2006 - house sparrows by a third allotments - valuable green spaces in urban areas - have declined by 80 % in 50 years the natterjack toad is found at only 50 sites in england , a fall of 80 % in the last century the small tortoiseshell butterfly has declined 81 % between 2003 and 2007 urban land cover in england is projected to rise more than 1 % to 11.9 % by 2016 source : natural england and conservationists will ensure they attracted the right animals and assess whether to fence off the towers .
house sparrow numbers are down 64 % in 25 years , the uk 's 17 species of bat are all now protected by law and there are just 56 butterfly species remaining in britain , figures show .
few know that better than presenter chris packham , who is joining bbc 2 's wildlife programme springwatch .
he thinks the towers are a " brilliant " idea , partly because modern urban houses do n't have holes to double up as nests .
" hopefully there will be room for bats , small nesting birds like great tits or blue tits and insects , " he says .
other towers built for barn owls have managed to also attract kestrels , he adds , and there is no reason why this design should n't work , although it wo n't be to every animal 's liking .
" foxes and badgers are quite wary and do n't want to be disturbed by dogs or people , so they tend to go to railway cuttings and embankments or quiet gardens , " he explains .
