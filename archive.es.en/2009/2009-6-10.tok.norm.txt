the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "

us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's offensive has prompted taliban revenge attacks the offensive has the backing of the united states and reportedly enjoys broad popular support in pakistan after a spate of worsening taliban-linked attacks which have killed more than 1,960 people since july 2007 .
tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .
in late may , 24 people were killed in a similar gun and suicide car bomb attack on a police building in eastern lahore - an attack claimed by pakistan 's tehreek-e-taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , which warned of more " massive attacks . "

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .

wednesday 's estimate was based on data from six of germany 's 16 states .
the new record low is largely due to consumer prices for energy-related products and food .
prices for energy dropped by an average of 8 percent , mostly due to the sharp slump in oil prices .
fuel prices dropped by almost 17 percent .
average food prices dropped by 1.2 percent compared to may 2008 with some dairy products and vegetables dropping as much as 40 percent .
without food and energy - which account for around 20 percent of average household spending - inflation would have amounted to 1.4 percent. ai / dpa / apf editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .
amnesty slams libya 's treatment of refugees meanwhile , amnesty international used the visit to slam gadhafi for tripoli 's treatment of african migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has a deal with libya to return refugees it intercepts calling on italian leaders to insist on human rights " guarantees " from tripoli , the london-based humanitarian group also blasted rome for the controversial policy it began implementing last month under which hundreds of boat people intercepted in the mediterranean were returned to libya from where they set out .
the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .
an amnesty delegation visited a detention centre in misratah , northwestern libya , where " hundreds of non-libyan citizens , most coming from eritrea but also from somalia , nigeria and mali , are held in conditions of serious overcrowding , " it said .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor .

according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .

" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .

italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .
amnesty slams libya 's treatment of refugees meanwhile , amnesty international used the visit to slam gadhafi for tripoli 's treatment of african migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has a deal with libya to return refugees it intercepts calling on italian leaders to insist on human rights " guarantees " from tripoli , the london-based humanitarian group also blasted rome for the controversial policy it began implementing last month under which hundreds of boat people intercepted in the mediterranean were returned to libya from where they set out .
the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .
an amnesty delegation visited a detention centre in misratah , northwestern libya , where " hundreds of non-libyan citizens , most coming from eritrea but also from somalia , nigeria and mali , are held in conditions of serious overcrowding , " it said .
" there were between 600 and 700 people in a space with a maximum capacity of 350 , " amnesty said in a statement .
during the visit , amnesty heard " worrying reports of discriminatory and degrading treatment and maltreatment of migrants from sub-saharan african countries by libyan citizens and libyan police forces , " it said .
" libya does not have a functioning system of asylum ... denies the presence of refugees in its territory ... -lrb- and has -rrb- indicated that it has no intention of adhering to the 1951 geneva convention on refugees , " amnesty added. nda , afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's offensive has prompted taliban revenge attacks the offensive has the backing of the united states and reportedly enjoys broad popular support in pakistan after a spate of worsening taliban-linked attacks which have killed more than 1,960 people since july 2007 .
tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .
in late may , 24 people were killed in a similar gun and suicide car bomb attack on a police building in eastern lahore - an attack claimed by pakistan 's tehreek-e-taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , which warned of more " massive attacks . "

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .
us president barack obama 's administration has asked germany to take in some of the remaining inmates and is planning to release others in the united states , according to a us official. nda , afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .
us president barack obama 's administration has asked germany to take in some of the remaining inmates and is planning to release others in the united states , according to a us official. nda , afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is setting up an institute to speed up the process . the new national consortium for translational cancer research , presented tuesday , june 9 , by german research minister annette schavan , would work toward seeing scientists ' findings implemented in medical treatment for cancer patients . " more than 436,000 people in germany develop cancer annually and 210,000 patients die of it every year , " schavan said .
" that 's why it is important for current cancer research results to make their way into treatment faster . " the consortium would be made up of the german cancer research center and the german cancer aid and would be funded annually with 40 million euros -lrb- $ 56 million -rrb- .
the organization would also work closely with the heidelberg university clinic and up to six other partner institutes . from labs to patients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are constantly learning more about how cancer affects humans getting current research into doctors ' hand will be one of the consortium 's first priorities .

" now we have to transport this knowledge into the care of people who are suffering from cancer . " the consortium will also serve as a cancer research clearing house , collecting and organizing research conducted at clinics and preventing research teams from duplicating trials of new or improved treatments . " it is an open secret that the quality of cancer treatment is improved when the number of clinical studies increases , " wiestler said . sms / dpa / bmbf editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "

us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .

germany is setting up an institute to speed up the process . the new national consortium for translational cancer research , presented tuesday , june 9 , by german research minister annette schavan , would work toward seeing scientists ' findings implemented in medical treatment for cancer patients . " more than 436,000 people in germany develop cancer annually and 210,000 patients die of it every year , " schavan said .
" that 's why it is important for current cancer research results to make their way into treatment faster . " the consortium would be made up of the german cancer research center and the german cancer aid and would be funded annually with 40 million euros -lrb- $ 56 million -rrb- .
the organization would also work closely with the heidelberg university clinic and up to six other partner institutes . from labs to patients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are constantly learning more about how cancer affects humans getting current research into doctors ' hand will be one of the consortium 's first priorities . " cancer research in germany has attained enormous insight over the past few years , " said otmar wiestler , the german cancer research center 's director .
" now we have to transport this knowledge into the care of people who are suffering from cancer . " the consortium will also serve as a cancer research clearing house , collecting and organizing research conducted at clinics and preventing research teams from duplicating trials of new or improved treatments . " it is an open secret that the quality of cancer treatment is improved when the number of clinical studies increases , " wiestler said . sms / dpa / bmbf editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .

us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .

"
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
obama to visit moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called for a global initiative on disarmament us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
russia and georgia fought a five-day war last year after georgia attempted to retake control of its breakaway , pro-russian region of south ossetia .
steinmeier , who arrived in moscow on tuesday , was also to hold talks with foreign minister sergei lavrov. hf / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .

tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.06.2009 amnesty blasts poor human rights record 10 years after kosovo war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outright war ended 10 years ago , but kosovo remains a divided and uneasy region a decade after nato concluded its military campaign in kosovo , and as the alliance is set to reduce its troops there , amnesty international 's kosovo expert told deutsche welle the crimes of the past have gone unpunished . the cessation of bombing operations in the breakaway region of kosovo on june 10 , 1999 , ended the last large-scale military confrontation between nato and serbia within ex-yugoslavia .
in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .

possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.06.2009 amnesty blasts poor human rights record 10 years after kosovo war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outright war ended 10 years ago , but kosovo remains a divided and uneasy region a decade after nato concluded its military campaign in kosovo , and as the alliance is set to reduce its troops there , amnesty international 's kosovo expert told deutsche welle the crimes of the past have gone unpunished . the cessation of bombing operations in the breakaway region of kosovo on june 10 , 1999 , ended the last large-scale military confrontation between nato and serbia within ex-yugoslavia .
in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.06.2009 amnesty blasts poor human rights record 10 years after kosovo war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outright war ended 10 years ago , but kosovo remains a divided and uneasy region a decade after nato concluded its military campaign in kosovo , and as the alliance is set to reduce its troops there , amnesty international 's kosovo expert told deutsche welle the crimes of the past have gone unpunished . the cessation of bombing operations in the breakaway region of kosovo on june 10 , 1999 , ended the last large-scale military confrontation between nato and serbia within ex-yugoslavia .
in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

police have said the drawings - valued at around 8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - were likely stolen . the search for the valuable sketches was in full swing , a paris police spokeswoman said on wednesday . it had been discovered on tuesday morning that the volume of 33 picasso sketches , originating from 1917 to 1924 , was missing from paris ' picasso museum .
the notebook measures 16 x 24 centimeters -lrb- roughly 6 x 9 inches -rrb- and has a red cover bearing the inscription " album " in gold lettering . officials have said they believe the notebook was stolen , however , signs of a break-in were not initially apparent .
the drawings had been kept in a heavy glass case , " that could only have been opened using special tools , " according to a statement from the french culture ministry . museum blamed for negligent security the picasso museum , located in the marais neighborhood of the french capital , faced hefty criticism for its lax security measures .
there were no security cameras in the room where the sketches were kept and also no alarm system , wrote the paris daily le figaro on wednesday . the museum has been undergoing renovation for the past several months and is set to close completely for an expansion that would double its exhibition space . in all , the picasso museum has 1,500 drawings by the spanish artist , in addition to 200 paintings and 158 sculptures . the artist 's works consistently fetch high prices at auctions and have frequently been a target of theft . picasso , who lived from 1881 to 1973 , is considered the investor of cubism and is one of the most significant artists of the 20th century .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

wednesday 's estimate was based on data from six of germany 's 16 states .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .
amnesty slams libya 's treatment of refugees meanwhile , amnesty international used the visit to slam gadhafi for tripoli 's treatment of african migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has a deal with libya to return refugees it intercepts calling on italian leaders to insist on human rights " guarantees " from tripoli , the london-based humanitarian group also blasted rome for the controversial policy it began implementing last month under which hundreds of boat people intercepted in the mediterranean were returned to libya from where they set out .
the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .
an amnesty delegation visited a detention centre in misratah , northwestern libya , where " hundreds of non-libyan citizens , most coming from eritrea but also from somalia , nigeria and mali , are held in conditions of serious overcrowding , " it said .
" there were between 600 and 700 people in a space with a maximum capacity of 350 , " amnesty said in a statement .
during the visit , amnesty heard " worrying reports of discriminatory and degrading treatment and maltreatment of migrants from sub-saharan african countries by libyan citizens and libyan police forces , " it said .
" libya does not have a functioning system of asylum ... denies the presence of refugees in its territory ... -lrb- and has -rrb- indicated that it has no intention of adhering to the 1951 geneva convention on refugees , " amnesty added. nda , afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .
us president barack obama 's administration has asked germany to take in some of the remaining inmates and is planning to release others in the united states , according to a us official. nda , afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has a deal with libya to return refugees it intercepts calling on italian leaders to insist on human rights " guarantees " from tripoli , the london-based humanitarian group also blasted rome for the controversial policy it began implementing last month under which hundreds of boat people intercepted in the mediterranean were returned to libya from where they set out .
the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .
an amnesty delegation visited a detention centre in misratah , northwestern libya , where " hundreds of non-libyan citizens , most coming from eritrea but also from somalia , nigeria and mali , are held in conditions of serious overcrowding , " it said .
" there were between 600 and 700 people in a space with a maximum capacity of 350 , " amnesty said in a statement .
during the visit , amnesty heard " worrying reports of discriminatory and degrading treatment and maltreatment of migrants from sub-saharan african countries by libyan citizens and libyan police forces , " it said .
" libya does not have a functioning system of asylum ... denies the presence of refugees in its territory ... -lrb- and has -rrb- indicated that it has no intention of adhering to the 1951 geneva convention on refugees , " amnesty added. nda , afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .

a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .

waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .

statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .
amnesty slams libya 's treatment of refugees meanwhile , amnesty international used the visit to slam gadhafi for tripoli 's treatment of african migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has a deal with libya to return refugees it intercepts calling on italian leaders to insist on human rights " guarantees " from tripoli , the london-based humanitarian group also blasted rome for the controversial policy it began implementing last month under which hundreds of boat people intercepted in the mediterranean were returned to libya from where they set out .
the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .

statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .

the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .

during the visit , amnesty heard " worrying reports of discriminatory and degrading treatment and maltreatment of migrants from sub-saharan african countries by libyan citizens and libyan police forces , " it said .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .

italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .

wednesday 's estimate was based on data from six of germany 's 16 states .
the new record low is largely due to consumer prices for energy-related products and food .
prices for energy dropped by an average of 8 percent , mostly due to the sharp slump in oil prices .
fuel prices dropped by almost 17 percent .
average food prices dropped by 1.2 percent compared to may 2008 with some dairy products and vegetables dropping as much as 40 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .
us president barack obama 's administration has asked germany to take in some of the remaining inmates and is planning to release others in the united states , according to a us official. nda , afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .

tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .
in late may , 24 people were killed in a similar gun and suicide car bomb attack on a police building in eastern lahore - an attack claimed by pakistan 's tehreek-e-taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , which warned of more " massive attacks . "

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's offensive has prompted taliban revenge attacks the offensive has the backing of the united states and reportedly enjoys broad popular support in pakistan after a spate of worsening taliban-linked attacks which have killed more than 1,960 people since july 2007 .
tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .
in late may , 24 people were killed in a similar gun and suicide car bomb attack on a police building in eastern lahore - an attack claimed by pakistan 's tehreek-e-taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , which warned of more " massive attacks . "
no group has yet claimed responsibility for tuesday 's hotel blast. nda , afp / ap / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.06.2009 chinese muslim inmates at guantanamo appeal to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although released from guantanamo , the uighurs still do n't have a home several uighurs held at guantanamo bay prison have appealed to the german government for asylum .
a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .

"
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
obama to visit moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called for a global initiative on disarmament us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
russia and georgia fought a five-day war last year after georgia attempted to retake control of its breakaway , pro-russian region of south ossetia .
steinmeier , who arrived in moscow on tuesday , was also to hold talks with foreign minister sergei lavrov. hf / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .

police have said the drawings - valued at around 8 million euros -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- - were likely stolen . the search for the valuable sketches was in full swing , a paris police spokeswoman said on wednesday . it had been discovered on tuesday morning that the volume of 33 picasso sketches , originating from 1917 to 1924 , was missing from paris ' picasso museum .
the notebook measures 16 x 24 centimeters -lrb- roughly 6 x 9 inches -rrb- and has a red cover bearing the inscription " album " in gold lettering . officials have said they believe the notebook was stolen , however , signs of a break-in were not initially apparent .
the drawings had been kept in a heavy glass case , " that could only have been opened using special tools , " according to a statement from the french culture ministry . museum blamed for negligent security the picasso museum , located in the marais neighborhood of the french capital , faced hefty criticism for its lax security measures .
there were no security cameras in the room where the sketches were kept and also no alarm system , wrote the paris daily le figaro on wednesday . the museum has been undergoing renovation for the past several months and is set to close completely for an expansion that would double its exhibition space . in all , the picasso museum has 1,500 drawings by the spanish artist , in addition to 200 paintings and 158 sculptures . the artist 's works consistently fetch high prices at auctions and have frequently been a target of theft . picasso , who lived from 1881 to 1973 , is considered the investor of cubism and is one of the most significant artists of the 20th century .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's offensive has prompted taliban revenge attacks the offensive has the backing of the united states and reportedly enjoys broad popular support in pakistan after a spate of worsening taliban-linked attacks which have killed more than 1,960 people since july 2007 .
tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .
in late may , 24 people were killed in a similar gun and suicide car bomb attack on a police building in eastern lahore - an attack claimed by pakistan 's tehreek-e-taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , which warned of more " massive attacks . "

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's offensive has prompted taliban revenge attacks the offensive has the backing of the united states and reportedly enjoys broad popular support in pakistan after a spate of worsening taliban-linked attacks which have killed more than 1,960 people since july 2007 .
tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .
in late may , 24 people were killed in a similar gun and suicide car bomb attack on a police building in eastern lahore - an attack claimed by pakistan 's tehreek-e-taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , which warned of more " massive attacks . "
no group has yet claimed responsibility for tuesday 's hotel blast. nda , afp / ap / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .
us president barack obama 's administration has asked germany to take in some of the remaining inmates and is planning to release others in the united states , according to a us official. nda , afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
obama to visit moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called for a global initiative on disarmament us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
russia and georgia fought a five-day war last year after georgia attempted to retake control of its breakaway , pro-russian region of south ossetia .
steinmeier , who arrived in moscow on tuesday , was also to hold talks with foreign minister sergei lavrov. hf / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .

"
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "

us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
russia and georgia fought a five-day war last year after georgia attempted to retake control of its breakaway , pro-russian region of south ossetia .

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .

some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .

the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .

and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .

the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force .

" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

wednesday 's estimate was based on data from six of germany 's 16 states .
the new record low is largely due to consumer prices for energy-related products and food .
prices for energy dropped by an average of 8 percent , mostly due to the sharp slump in oil prices .
fuel prices dropped by almost 17 percent .
average food prices dropped by 1.2 percent compared to may 2008 with some dairy products and vegetables dropping as much as 40 percent .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .

the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .
an amnesty delegation visited a detention centre in misratah , northwestern libya , where " hundreds of non-libyan citizens , most coming from eritrea but also from somalia , nigeria and mali , are held in conditions of serious overcrowding , " it said .
" there were between 600 and 700 people in a space with a maximum capacity of 350 , " amnesty said in a statement .
during the visit , amnesty heard " worrying reports of discriminatory and degrading treatment and maltreatment of migrants from sub-saharan african countries by libyan citizens and libyan police forces , " it said .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .
amnesty slams libya 's treatment of refugees meanwhile , amnesty international used the visit to slam gadhafi for tripoli 's treatment of african migrants .

the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .
an amnesty delegation visited a detention centre in misratah , northwestern libya , where " hundreds of non-libyan citizens , most coming from eritrea but also from somalia , nigeria and mali , are held in conditions of serious overcrowding , " it said .
" there were between 600 and 700 people in a space with a maximum capacity of 350 , " amnesty said in a statement .
during the visit , amnesty heard " worrying reports of discriminatory and degrading treatment and maltreatment of migrants from sub-saharan african countries by libyan citizens and libyan police forces , " it said .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .

putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

"
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
obama to visit moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called for a global initiative on disarmament us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
russia and georgia fought a five-day war last year after georgia attempted to retake control of its breakaway , pro-russian region of south ossetia .

although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .
" the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence , " the court said in a statement. ai / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .

us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .
he said it is a form of torture that president barack obama 's administration could never condone , thus stressing the new administration 's break with anti-terror policies under former president george w. bush. db / reuters / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
obama to visit moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called for a global initiative on disarmament us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
russia and georgia fought a five-day war last year after georgia attempted to retake control of its breakaway , pro-russian region of south ossetia .
steinmeier , who arrived in moscow on tuesday , was also to hold talks with foreign minister sergei lavrov. hf / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .
amnesty slams libya 's treatment of refugees meanwhile , amnesty international used the visit to slam gadhafi for tripoli 's treatment of african migrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy has a deal with libya to return refugees it intercepts calling on italian leaders to insist on human rights " guarantees " from tripoli , the london-based humanitarian group also blasted rome for the controversial policy it began implementing last month under which hundreds of boat people intercepted in the mediterranean were returned to libya from where they set out .
the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .
an amnesty delegation visited a detention centre in misratah , northwestern libya , where " hundreds of non-libyan citizens , most coming from eritrea but also from somalia , nigeria and mali , are held in conditions of serious overcrowding , " it said .
" there were between 600 and 700 people in a space with a maximum capacity of 350 , " amnesty said in a statement .
during the visit , amnesty heard " worrying reports of discriminatory and degrading treatment and maltreatment of migrants from sub-saharan african countries by libyan citizens and libyan police forces , " it said .
" libya does not have a functioning system of asylum ... denies the presence of refugees in its territory ... -lrb- and has -rrb- indicated that it has no intention of adhering to the 1951 geneva convention on refugees , " amnesty added. nda , afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.06.2009 amnesty blasts poor human rights record 10 years after kosovo war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outright war ended 10 years ago , but kosovo remains a divided and uneasy region a decade after nato concluded its military campaign in kosovo , and as the alliance is set to reduce its troops there , amnesty international 's kosovo expert told deutsche welle the crimes of the past have gone unpunished . the cessation of bombing operations in the breakaway region of kosovo on june 10 , 1999 , ended the last large-scale military confrontation between nato and serbia within ex-yugoslavia .
in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.06.2009 amnesty blasts poor human rights record 10 years after kosovo war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outright war ended 10 years ago , but kosovo remains a divided and uneasy region a decade after nato concluded its military campaign in kosovo , and as the alliance is set to reduce its troops there , amnesty international 's kosovo expert told deutsche welle the crimes of the past have gone unpunished . the cessation of bombing operations in the breakaway region of kosovo on june 10 , 1999 , ended the last large-scale military confrontation between nato and serbia within ex-yugoslavia .
in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's offensive has prompted taliban revenge attacks the offensive has the backing of the united states and reportedly enjoys broad popular support in pakistan after a spate of worsening taliban-linked attacks which have killed more than 1,960 people since july 2007 .
tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .
in late may , 24 people were killed in a similar gun and suicide car bomb attack on a police building in eastern lahore - an attack claimed by pakistan 's tehreek-e-taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , which warned of more " massive attacks . "

the united nations said the dead included two of their employees - a serbian national who worked for the refugee agency unhcr , and a filipino who worked for children 's agency unicef .
dozens of aid workers were staying at the opulent hotel before heading out to refugee camps in north west frontier province , where pakistan launched military action in three districts on april 26 to try to crush taliban rebels .
the air and ground assault in swat , lower dir and buner has sent up to two million people fleeing their homes .
possible revenge for swat valley offensive the current campaign centered on swat was launched when taliban fighters advanced to within 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- of islamabad , flouting a deal to put three million people under sharia law in exchange for peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's offensive has prompted taliban revenge attacks the offensive has the backing of the united states and reportedly enjoys broad popular support in pakistan after a spate of worsening taliban-linked attacks which have killed more than 1,960 people since july 2007 .
tuesday 's bombing was the seventh deadly blast in peshawar in a month .
more than 155 people have been killed in similar attacks across pakistan since the anti-taliban military offensive began .
a top provincial official said the massive blast at the pearl continental was likely to be the latest retaliatory attack by islamic militants reacting against the six-week offensive against them ..
" the blast is a reaction to the army offensive in swat and malakand .
the possibility of this type of terrorist attack can not be ruled out in future , " north west frontier province information minister mian iftikhar hussain said .
foreign nationals among the wounded police official abdul ghafoor afridi told afp that 57 people were injured , including a german and other foreign nationals who have been taken from peshawar , the provincial capital , to islamabad for treatment .
" the number of casualties could rise as we fear that some people are still trapped under the debris , " afridi said .
" one portion of the hotel was totally destroyed .
three people including a manager of the hotel are missing and we fear they are under the debris . "
bildunterschrift : the enormous explosion ripped through the pearl continental , collapsing large parts of the hotel early reports suggest at least two men dressed as security guards shot their way through a security barrier and into the hotel compound , where they managed to detonate about 500 kilograms of explosives packed in a pick-up truck .
" it was such a huge and powerful blast that the engine flew up to the fourth floor of the hotel , " police official shafiullah khan told reporters .

wednesday 's estimate was based on data from six of germany 's 16 states .
the new record low is largely due to consumer prices for energy-related products and food .
prices for energy dropped by an average of 8 percent , mostly due to the sharp slump in oil prices .
fuel prices dropped by almost 17 percent .
average food prices dropped by 1.2 percent compared to may 2008 with some dairy products and vegetables dropping as much as 40 percent .
without food and energy - which account for around 20 percent of average household spending - inflation would have amounted to 1.4 percent. ai / dpa / apf editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .

italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "
italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts libya 's growing tally of italian investments , including banking group unicredit , as the oil producer 's $ 65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in italian power producer enel .
libya 's investment drive in italy has only just begun and italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties , analysts say .

the boat people were not given a chance to apply for asylum and were " forcibly returned to libya without regard for any evaluation of their need for international protection , " amnesty italy said in a statement .

as well as meeting with the italian expellees , gadhafi 's three-day visit will also include a series of meetings with italian officials , including premier silvio berlusconi , and audiences with university students , businesspeople and a delegation of prominent italian women .
the italian foreign ministry said gadhafi and berlusconi are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements .
the visit , gadhafi 's first in 40 years as libyan leader , was made possible by a treaty signed last august providing for italy to invest $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.4 billion euros -rrb- in libya to make up for its 30 years of occupation of the oil-rich north african state .
formerly part of the ottoman empire , libya was occupied by italy in 1911 before become officially a colony in the 1930s .
the country gained its independence in 1951 after a brief period under a un-mandated franco-british administration .
last year 's friendship and cooperation treaty also gives libya an apology for its colonization and grants italy greater rights to libyan gas and oil , according to berlusconi .
libya had used the regular departure from its shores of boatloads of illegal immigrants headed for italy as a way of putting pressure on rome .
italy finally accepted joint patrols in its territorial waters and the two countries recently signed a controversial new immigration accord under which italy repatriates migrants who set off from libyan shores and who are intercepted on the mediterranean .
business opportunities on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi and gadhafi are now close trading partners the historic visit , one which seemed less likely than gadhafi “ visiting saturn ” according to a recent libyan newspaper editorial , is also likely to include a round of business talks . the libyan leader is scheduled to meet business chiefs and people from the worlds of industry politics and culture on friday .
italy is libya 's biggest trading partner and also its leading supplier of goods .
jomaa al-asta , president of the libyan general union of chambers of trade and industry , said 52 italian companies have operations in libya , the most of any country .
" we would like still larger italian investments , " asta said .
" we want them to be our partners in africa and for us to be their partners in europe . "

the case marks the first time that the european court of human rights has ruled against a state in a case of domestic violence .
the court also ruled turkey had violated the convention on human rights which prohibits torture , inhumane treatment and discrimination .
the government in ankara was ordered to pay 36,000 euros -lrb- $ 50,000 -rrb- in compensation to a applicant whose former husband shot her mother .
" this is a precedent for further cases in countries of the european council , " a court spokesperson said .
turkish authorities failed to prevent " honor killing " the 37-year-old applicant had repeatedly appealed for protection by the authorities , warning that both her life and that of her mother were in danger .
but despite injuries from several earlier incidents of abuse , turkish authorities failed to react .
the shooting took place in 2002 when the applicant and her mother had tried to flee to another city . the applicant 's former husband was then found guilty and sentenced to life by a turkish court but was later released pending his appeal that he had committed the killing to protect his family 's " honor . "
according to human rights organization amnesty international , as many as half of turkish women face domestic violence and dozens of women are killed in so called " honor killings " each year .
the organization claims that domestic violence is largely accepted by police , authorities and the judiciary in turkey .

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .

us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .

"
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
obama to visit moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called for a global initiative on disarmament us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .

putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .

" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "

" more than 436,000 people in germany develop cancer annually and 210,000 patients die of it every year , " schavan said .
" that 's why it is important for current cancer research results to make their way into treatment faster . " the consortium would be made up of the german cancer research center and the german cancer aid and would be funded annually with 40 million euros -lrb- $ 56 million -rrb- .
the organization would also work closely with the heidelberg university clinic and up to six other partner institutes . from labs to patients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers are constantly learning more about how cancer affects humans getting current research into doctors ' hand will be one of the consortium 's first priorities .

" now we have to transport this knowledge into the care of people who are suffering from cancer . " the consortium will also serve as a cancer research clearing house , collecting and organizing research conducted at clinics and preventing research teams from duplicating trials of new or improved treatments .

" more than 436,000 people in germany develop cancer annually and 210,000 patients die of it every year , " schavan said .

" now we have to transport this knowledge into the care of people who are suffering from cancer . " the consortium will also serve as a cancer research clearing house , collecting and organizing research conducted at clinics and preventing research teams from duplicating trials of new or improved treatments . " it is an open secret that the quality of cancer treatment is improved when the number of clinical studies increases , " wiestler said . sms / dpa / bmbf editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say officers repeatedly dunked the suspected drug dealers ' heads in buckets of water during the operation last november .
both the daily mail and the times have reported on the allegations . initially , london 's metropolitan police force had launched an investigation into the conduct of the six officers based at enfield in the north of the capital .
last month , the case was referred to the independent police complaints commission .
a police spokesman refused to confirm the reports , saying that it was not appropriate to make assumptions while the investigation is ongoing .
" these are serious allegations that do raise real concern , " he said , " and if found true , the strongest possible action will be taken . "
waterboarding condemned the brutal interrogation method that gained worldwide notoriety as a cia method used on inmates in the guantanamo bay prison camp simulates the sensation of drowning .
the victim is held , lying on his or her back with the head inclined downwards ; then water is poured on the face , into the nose and mouth – the person inhales water , and believes he is about to die .
earlier this year , us attorney general eric holder ruled out the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 10.06.2009 far right parties elected into several town councils großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters are not afraid to make themselves heard the far-right npd party in germany suffered slight losses in municipal elections at the weekend .
but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .
while the country uses proportional representation , up until february 2008 a party had to win five percent of the vote to qualify for any seats in local councils , but the highest court in germany deemed that this discriminated against smaller parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster in an npd hotspot , anklam in mecklenburg west-pomerania , reads " this is where we speak up " although the npd lost ground in some regions compared to its performance in the last few years , it has compensated for this by being able to grab seats in areas where it usually had little or no influence , with one of germany 's western-most cities - trier - being the prime example .
the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .

the traditional strongholds for the npd are much further east , in former east germany , where unemployment rates are higher , and where immigrants - especially from eastern europe - are making young people without higher education or special skills fear for their livelihoods .
in some areas in the eastern state of mecklenburg west-pomerania , the npd is considered a mainstream party , according to stephan kraemer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" the good results for the far right parties are a trend , not an exception , " he says .
" this can be largely explained by the general public 's frustration with mainstream parties . "
" it 's not the total social losers that are voting for them , " journalist sundermeyer explains .
" it 's the small people that are afraid to lose more in the future - actually it 's the same people that voted for the nsdap in the 20s and 30s of the last century .
plus , each society has a certain percentage of people who are racist , and they vote for the npd in germany . "
sundermeyer spent much of his time researching his book in these eastern regions , and says he was astonished to see that the npd is considered a mainstream party in certain areas .
" you have festivals , or public holidays where the npd gets itself involved with the local society .
they hand out gifts to little children and they really take part .
maybe they organize some social activities at the local playgrounds , or at social clubs , and so on .
for us it was pretty astonishing to see that such social work is basically an accepted norm in some parts of germany . "
nationwide , the npd accounts for 2.3 percent of the popular vote , but in the towns where it concentrates its resources , the party frequently woos between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population .
the reinhardtsdorf-schoena constituency in saxony was one of the npd 's biggest single successes during sunday 's ballots - there , it won 22 percent of the vote .

but the result was far better than most had expected , and the group even secured some seats in western germany . the national democratic party , or npd , fought an effective rearguard action in germany 's recent municipal elections , retaining many of its seats despite being plagued by a number of problems this year .
as usual , they were strongest in the eastern german states of thuringia , saxony and mecklenburg pomerania , but they also enjoyed some success in saxony-anhalt , saarland and even in the western city of trier .
many experts , like professor steffen schoon from the university of rostock , believe that these types of results will become a regular fixture .
" the npd has now gathered a base of regular voters , " schoon says .
in total the npd have claimed well over 100 seats on regional and city councils .
these municipal positions are far removed from the national government in berlin , but npd expert and journalist olaf sundermeyer says it 's all part of the group 's gameplan .
" for them it 's part of their strategy to get seats in the local elections so as to build up their structure , " he says .
" because all politics are local , all power is local , and therefore the npd concentrates mostly on local and state elections . "
however , the npd is n't looking for political power in the traditional sense .
the party is not trying to influence local policy or take charge of certain towns and cities , instead it is trying to raise its profile with the public , just by being in office .
" npd local politicians are not doing any politics , they are only campaigning .
they are misusing local parliaments for their campaign .
they are 100 percent populists , they are not politicians interested in doing any kind of local politics , " says sundermeyer , who has spent the last three years with npd officials and supporters researching a book called in der npd : reisen in der national befreite zone -lrb- which loosely translates as " inside the ndp " -rrb- .
" they 're only looking to maximize the public impact of their propaganda , that 's why they want to use the local councils as a stage .
on top of that , they 're making money by being part time politicians .
even in these local councils they are receiving money from the state and this money they spend for their next campaign , for the next election . "
tough times this money is of crucial importance for the small npd party , especially at the moment .
early in may , the party had to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros -lrb- over $ 3 million -rrb- , after senior members were found guilty of embezzlement .
this , coupled with the costs of fighting a protracted legal battle to prevent the party from being banned and declared unconstitutional , has driven the npd to the brink of bankruptcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader udo voigt -lrb- right -rrb- has spent a lot of time in court this year " they have major problems .
were it not for these financial issues , then the success of the npd in this german ' super election year ' would have been much bigger than it is already , " sundermayer says .
the success may be modest - the npd is indisputably a fringe party in germany - but because of the legacy of nazi germany , any npd success comes under close scrutiny here .
" they 're an extreme right wing party , they 're much more extreme for example than the nationalists in great britain -lsb- british national party -rsb- that had a huge success in the european elections , " sundermeyer says . he draws many parallels between npd policies and those of adolf hitler 's national socialist government of the 1930s and 40s .
" they want to re-socialize the economy ; they want to get germany out of nato and out of the eu ; they want to kick everybody that is not a ' pure german ' out of germany .
with these goals they are on a very similar level to the old nsdap party . "
broader influence party leader udo voigt , who recently won a leadership challenge staving off division within his own ranks , has headed up the npd for over a decade .
his party has been able to win seats in broader segments of germany this year , thanks to a constitutional court decision in 2008 , which scrapped the so-called five percent hurdle formerly in effect in germany .

the german cabinet has approved the creation of a " bad bank " to deal with toxic assets from state-owned banks .
in return , the number of state banks is to be reduced to three . the bill would see the creation of a federal agency for financial market stabilisation , called fmsa to be based in frankfurt .
the agency would take in the so-called " toxic assets " of the state banks and savings and loan banks .
berlin also wants to consolidate the entire sector by reducing the number of large state banks - so called landesbanken - from the current seven to three by the end of next year .
a bad bank draft for the private bank sector is already in the works .
the state-owned institutions , however , required a separate extended model .
berlin wants to have a large chunk of responsibility remain on the shoulders of the state governments that are in charge of the banks .
the toxic assets are to remain connected to their original institution and future losses of the outsourced assets can be rolled back on their books - or those of the respective state government .
regional banks remain crucial to germany 's economy the new federal agency for financial market stabilisation fmsa would take the toxic assets only on the condition that the banks can present a " sustainable business model as well as an appropriate capitalisation of the transferring credit or financial services institutes . "
many of the risky financial assets that banks have acquired in recent years now prove impossible to sell at a reasonable return in the current global financial crisis .
with these so-called toxic assets weighing down the banks ' balance sheets , financial institutions are hesitant to continue borrowing - both among themselves and to business and companies .
yet the regional banks ' role in local lending remains crucial to europe 's biggest economy , and experts have warned that a prolonged credit crunch will worsen the country 's current economic woes. ai / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

numerous problems raised doubts about south africa ’ s ability to finish in time , but things are right on schedule now , and anticipation is high . for a long time now , no one has mentioned the so-called ‘ plan b ' in south africa .
last year , there was talk that should south africa not be ready in time , another country would be waiting in the starting blocks as alternate hosts of the world cup .
this was when south africa was plagued by problems hindering its preparations for the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
now , the threat of striking construction workers in polokwane , for example , is gone , and delays caused by rainfall and strong winds , which hindered the construction of the stadium in durban over and over again have been overcome .
test run in june bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official ball for the confederations cup which begins on sunday four of the 10 world cup stadiums are to be given a test run starting on sunday .
that 's the first day of the confederations cup , which opens with a match between south africa and iraq at johannesburg 's ellis park stadium .
for a while , the completion of the stadiums was one of the biggest problems facing world cup organizers .
alf oschatz from berlin has world cup stadium experience . before germany hosted the world cup in 2006 , he worked at the stadiums in frankfurt and berlin .
the engineer has lived in south africa for two and a half years and is a project manager , responsible for the world cup stadium in durban .
" the stadiums will get completed , " oschatz says .
" certain stadiums will have problems meeting their anticipated completion dates exactly , but overall the stadiums will not be the problem . "
in durban the stadium is already about 75 percent finished , and the next tasks on the list are the vip areas and the locker rooms .
the stadium is scheduled to be handed over to fifa later this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stadiums , including johannesburg 's soccer city , are still under construction security remains key issue the biggest problem facing world cup organizers is the high crime rate in south africa .
although the rate has dropped in recent years , the number of people who meet a violent death every year in south africa is well into the thousands .
statistics like that are enough to keep visitors from around the world away , which is a problem danny jordaan , the manager of the national organizing committee , confronts over and over again .
" ' what about crime ? '
this is a question that was asked in berlin , beijing and new york , everywhere i went : crime , " jordaan says .
" the question of crime is quite separate and distinct from security around events . "
almost 200,000 police officers are to provide the security during the world cup for football fans throughout the country .
they are to be supported by a completely new fleet if vehicles and helicopters , and a financial injection of 76 million euros from south africa 's minister of finance trevor manuel is to provide a new computer technology system for security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 10.06.2009 putin could imagine a russia with no nuclear weapons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
putin asked russian prime minister vladimir putin says russia could consider getting rid of its nuclear arsenal if all other countries agreed to do so as well . after meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , putin was asked if he could imagine a russia without nuclear weapons .
" of course , " he answered .
" what do we need nuclear weapons for ? "
steinmeier is visiting leaders in moscow and has been encouraging the kremlin to take part in a global disarmament initiative proposed by us president barack obama .
putin 's answer did have one caveat , however .
" if those who invented the atomic bomb , and used it , are prepared to do away with atom bombs , then we would welcome this , " he said , suggesting his country 's involvement is dependent on us disarmament .
the russian news agency interfax , however , has reported that russia wants to keep at least 1,500 nuclear warheads .
a " unique historic opportunity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said medvedev seemed ready to disarm steinmeier is wrapping up a two-day visit to moscow , during which he also met with russian president dmitry medvedev .
putin 's comments support steinmeier 's view that medvedev and russia are ready for disarmament .
" i have the impression , " steinmeier said , " that medvedev is just as ambitious about this issue as his american counterpart . "
earlier in the day , in an address to the russian academy of science , steinmeier said that all nations should make constructive efforts to disarm .
" this has to be the year when international disarmament efforts move back to the top of the agenda , " he said .
steinmeier stressed that the talks between russia and the us on replacing the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty were " a vital step on the difficult path towards a world free of nuclear weapons . "
" the outstretched hand from washington should be accepted , " he added , calling the warming of relations between the kremlin and the us a " unique historic opportunity . "
obama to visit moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has called for a global initiative on disarmament us president obama is scheduled to travel to moscow early next month for key talks on a follow-up to start , which expires on december 5 .
us and russian negotiators have been holding preliminary meetings ahead of those talks . moscow has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to us plans , which it strongly opposes , to deploy an anti-missile shield in central europe .
the start treaty was signed in 1991 , just before the break-up of the soviet union .
steinmeier also touched upon last year 's military conflict between russia and georgia .
he urged moscow to adopt a " constructive " role and warned russia not to fall back into old patterns of thought .
the german foreign minister stressed that unresolved territorial disputes did not have a place in the europe of the 21st century .
russia and georgia fought a five-day war last year after georgia attempted to retake control of its breakaway , pro-russian region of south ossetia .
steinmeier , who arrived in moscow on tuesday , was also to hold talks with foreign minister sergei lavrov. hf / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a remote pacific island has agreed to accept them but only on a temporary basis . seema saifee , a lawyer for the uighur detainees , told spiegel online that their case had been put to the german government .
" our clients implore the federal government to open the door of germany for them and to persuade other european nations to give protection to many other stateless guantanamo prisoners , " saifee said .
germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble made it clear last week that a decision could not be made because germany regarded the information provided by the us state department on the uighurs as insufficient .
the interior ministry has refused other applications from former guantanamo inmates on national security grounds .
saifee said the men had been “ upset and disappointed ” by the critical attitude of germany 's interior minister . “ the uighurs see germany with the largest uighur community in europe as the best way to end their imprisonment for nearly a decade at guantanmo bay , ” she said .
pacific island temporarily takes in uighurs on wednesday , the small pacific island of palau agreed to accept the uighers on a temporary basis but its government made it clear that it could not grant them permanent asylum .
the detainees , part of a turkic muslim minority that has long faced persecution in china , were part of a group of 22 uighurs living in a self-contained camp in afghanistan when the us-led invasion was launched in october 2001 as part of a military campaign in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
when the bombings against the taliban began , the uighurs fled to the mountains , but they ended up in american hands after being turned over to pakistani authorities , in some cases by bounty hunters .
the 17 muslims from china 's remote northwestern xinjiang province were accused of having trained in al qaeda camps and were transferred to the notorious us military prison at guantanamo bay , in southern cuba .
uighurs free after us court upholds innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has taken in some detainees but searches for other nations to do the same they were briefly declared " enemy combatants " before the administration of former president george bush withdrew its claims , as early as 2004 for most of the detainees .
us federal courts later upheld their innocence . the defense department and the state department have tried unsuccessfully for several years to arrange the men 's transfer to a third country , saying they face the risk of mistreatment if they return to china .
beijing regards the uighur detainees as " chinese terrorists " and has cracked down on uighur separatists .
in 2006 , albania took in five uighurs from guantanamo .
but since then , no other country has stepped forward .
us president barack obama 's administration has asked germany to take in some of the remaining inmates and is planning to release others in the united states , according to a us official. nda , afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 10.06.2009 amnesty blasts poor human rights record 10 years after kosovo war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outright war ended 10 years ago , but kosovo remains a divided and uneasy region a decade after nato concluded its military campaign in kosovo , and as the alliance is set to reduce its troops there , amnesty international 's kosovo expert told deutsche welle the crimes of the past have gone unpunished . the cessation of bombing operations in the breakaway region of kosovo on june 10 , 1999 , ended the last large-scale military confrontation between nato and serbia within ex-yugoslavia .
in the decade since , kosovo - which has been under united nations administration and which declared independence in february of last year - has seen the return of a measure of stability .
and nato is expected to announce on thursday that it is reducing the number of its troops in kosovo by a third , from 15,000 to 10,000 .
but a report published earlier this week by amnesty international says the west has little reason to be proud of its record in terms of clearing up human rights abuses by ethnic serbs and albanians against one another .
" nato singularly failed in one of its main tasks in kosovo - to ensure the right of return for all refugees , " amnesty 's balkans expert sian jones told deutsche welle .
" so it 's not a great disappointment for us that some nato troops may be leaving .
they were little more than window-dressing . "
some 850,000 albanians were forced from their homes in the late 1990s as violence escalated between albanian separatists , chiefly the kosovo liberation army , and police forces loyal to serbia , which considers kosovo to be an integral part of its territory .
most of them later returned , but approximately 200,000 serbs and roma who fled the violence remain refugees .
estimates of the number killed by the principles in the conflict and in nato air strikes vary dramatically , but all the figures run into the thousands .
ill-prepared for the ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty says kosovo needs to guarantee the right to return for all refugees nato began bombing serbian targets on march 24 , 1999 , citing fears that a genocide could be in the offing , after serbia 's allies russia and china blocked united nations measures aimed at forcing an end to the conflict .
the campaign , known as operation allied force , was concluded in less than three months .
but nato was caught off-guard , when some 500,000 albanian refugees flooded back into kosovo after the cessation of hostilities .
" they were woefully unprepared , " jones said .
" the idea was to go into kosovo and protect people , but nobody anticipated so many albanians would return so soon , and they were unable to deal with it .
there are reliable reports of children being abducted less than 100 meters from nato posts . "
in a statement released to mark the publication of the report , entitled burying the past : impunity for enforced disappearances and abductions in kosovo , amnesty international estimates that some 800 serbs , roma and other minorities were kidnapped after june 1999 " mostly under the eyes of the nato-led peacekeeping kosovo force . "
amnesty estimates that serbian police and other forces abducted more than 3,000 ethnic albanians during the war itself .
a culture of impunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu police force eulex has taken over some duties from nato and the un kosovo has since dropped out of the headlines around most of the world .
and amnesty international says nato , the eu , the un and the kosovo government have given low priority to pursuing human rights violations there , especially after a brief flare-up of violence by albanians against serbs in 2004 .
" there is a culture of impunity created by kosovo authorities who have failed to demand the prosecution of people who could have or indeed have had allegations made against them , " jones said .
" unmik -lsb- the un 's interim civilian administration in kosovo -rsb- essentially decided in 2004 not to go ahead with resolving human rights violations and make political stability a priority . "
the current kosovo government , amnesty contends , is reticent to go after potential war criminals , especially on the albanian side , because many of the individuals concerned retain influence in kosovar society .
but resolving the injustices of the past , the organization argues , is an integral part of achieving lasting peace in the future .
" it 's up to the kosovo authorities to ensure right of return and a guarantee of non-repetition , after 2004 , roma and serbs do n't believe in this , " jones told deutsche welle .
" we hope that unmik will improve efforts to bring both serbs and albanians to justice . "
ten years on from the 1999 kosovo war , the region is relatively calm .
but that stability has only been achieved , critics argue , by ignoring the injustices of the previous decade .

the 17 men are ethnic uighurs , now being held at the guantanamo bay detention centre on cuba , and the us has asked for help to re-settle them .
their fate was problematic due to fears for their safety if they were repatriated to china .
palau , a former us trust territory , grants diplomatic recognition to taiwan , not china .
palau president johnson toribiong said his government had " agreed to accommodate the united states of america 's request to temporarily resettle in palau up to 17 ethnic uighur detainees ... subject to periodic review . "
' humanitarian ' in a statement , he said his tiny country is " honoured and proud " to resettle the detainees , who have been found not to be " enemy combatants . "

media requires javascript to play .
more from bbc world service he said the agreement was a " humanitarian gesture " , which had nothing to do with the upcoming review of the compact of free association under which the us gives large sums to palau .
us officials asked mr toribiong on 4 june to accept some or all of the 17 uighur detainees due to strong us congressional opposition to releasing them on us soil .
guantanamo bay officials have been attempting to fulfil us president barack obama 's order to close the detention facility by early next year .
palau , with a population of about 20,000 , is an archipelago of eight main islands plus more than 250 islets that is best known for diving and tourism and is located some 800 km -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- east of the philippines in the pacific ocean .
the us will not send the uighurs back to china for fear they will be tortured or executed .
beijing says uighur insurgents are leading an islamic separatist movement in china 's far west and wants those held at guantanamo to be returned to china .
analysts said the fact that palau is an ally of taiwan , not china , could have helped the negotiations .

the 17 men are ethnic uighurs , now being held at the guantanamo bay detention centre on cuba , and the us has asked for help to re-settle them .
their fate was problematic due to fears for their safety if they were repatriated to china .
palau , a former us trust territory , grants diplomatic recognition to taiwan , not china .
palau president johnson toribiong said his government had " agreed to accommodate the united states of america 's request to temporarily resettle in palau up to 17 ethnic uighur detainees ... subject to periodic review . "
' humanitarian ' in a statement , he said his tiny country is " honoured and proud " to resettle the detainees , who have been found not to be " enemy combatants . "

more from bbc world service he said the agreement was a " humanitarian gesture " , which had nothing to do with the upcoming review of the compact of free association under which the us gives large sums to palau .
us officials asked mr toribiong on 4 june to accept some or all of the 17 uighur detainees due to strong us congressional opposition to releasing them on us soil .
guantanamo bay officials have been attempting to fulfil us president barack obama 's order to close the detention facility by early next year .
palau , with a population of about 20,000 , is an archipelago of eight main islands plus more than 250 islets that is best known for diving and tourism and is located some 800 km -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- east of the philippines in the pacific ocean .
the us will not send the uighurs back to china for fear they will be tortured or executed .
beijing says uighur insurgents are leading an islamic separatist movement in china 's far west and wants those held at guantanamo to be returned to china .
analysts said the fact that palau is an ally of taiwan , not china , could have helped the negotiations .
in 2006 , albania accepted five uighur detainees from guantanamo but has since balked at taking others , partly for fear of diplomatic repercussions from china .
australia has already twice rejected us appeals to resettle the uighurs .
palau has retained close ties with the united states since independence in 1994 when it signed a free compact of association with the us .

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement andrew arbour is a buy-to-let landlord who is still doing well .
he blames lack of research for the rise in repossessions buy-to-let landlords are losing their properties at over three times the rate of other homeowners , research shows .
council of mortgage lenders figures show 1,700 buy-to-let properties were repossessed by lenders in the first three months of this year .
but landlords lost 4,100 properties when cases of lenders appointing a receiver of rent are included .
a receiver of rent collects rent on behalf of a lender when the landlord defaults on the mortgage .
the recession is also making buy-to-let mortgages much harder to come by .
popular process as the downturn bites , lenders are appointing more receivers of rent .
in this process , a tenant is allowed to remain in a property instead of losing their home .
it also gives the lender time to decide what to do with the property , whilst offsetting the mortgage interest against the rent .
that in turn can help reduce the arrears faced by the landlord .
in the first three months of 2008 , there were just 300 receivers of rent appointed , compared with 900 repossessions .
in the first three months of this year 2,400 receivers of rent were appointed - an eight fold increase and far more than the number of buy-to-let repossessions .
city centre flats were popular among buy-to-let investors this mean that 0.35 % of buy-to-let properties were taken back by lenders - more than three times the rate in the owner occupier markets where 0.11 % of mortgaged properties were lost .
many landlords got into trouble after paying too much for buy-to-let flats .
estate agents talk of investors buying places which they had n't seen , or which had n't been built yet in a desperate race for property riches .
but for many that race has been well and truly lost .
rents have often not lived up to expectations , and landlords have struggled to pay the mortgage .
and with falling house prices - which have often hit city centre flats especially hard - many could not afford to sell either .
lenders get tougher the situation has been made more difficult by lenders getting tougher over mortgages , with buy-to-let loans particularly badly affected .
figures from the financial comparison company , moneyfacts , show at the peak of the boom in september 2007 there were 3,662 different buy to let mortgages available .
last month there were just 218 - a fall of 94 % .
and those mortgages that are available need bigger deposits .
at the beginning of last year it was easy to get a buy to let mortgage with a 15 % deposit .
now borrowers need a 25 % deposit to have any chance .
all of this is hitting the number of buy-to- let mortgages taken out .
in the first three months of this year there were 22,400 new buy to let mortgages .
even if the decline halted and each subsequent quarter were the same that would mean a total of 89,600 new buy to let mortgages being taken out in 2009 .
compare that with the height of the boom two years ago - when 346,000 buy to let mortgages were snapped up in just twelve months .

it also gives the lender time to decide what to do with the property , whilst offsetting the mortgage interest against the rent .
that in turn can help reduce the arrears faced by the landlord .
in the first three months of 2008 , there were just 300 receivers of rent appointed , compared with 900 repossessions .
in the first three months of this year 2,400 receivers of rent were appointed - an eight fold increase and far more than the number of buy-to-let repossessions .
city centre flats were popular among buy-to-let investors this mean that 0.35 % of buy-to-let properties were taken back by lenders - more than three times the rate in the owner occupier markets where 0.11 % of mortgaged properties were lost .
many landlords got into trouble after paying too much for buy-to-let flats .
estate agents talk of investors buying places which they had n't seen , or which had n't been built yet in a desperate race for property riches .
but for many that race has been well and truly lost .
rents have often not lived up to expectations , and landlords have struggled to pay the mortgage .
and with falling house prices - which have often hit city centre flats especially hard - many could not afford to sell either .
lenders get tougher the situation has been made more difficult by lenders getting tougher over mortgages , with buy-to-let loans particularly badly affected .
figures from the financial comparison company , moneyfacts , show at the peak of the boom in september 2007 there were 3,662 different buy to let mortgages available .
last month there were just 218 - a fall of 94 % .
and those mortgages that are available need bigger deposits .
at the beginning of last year it was easy to get a buy to let mortgage with a 15 % deposit .
now borrowers need a 25 % deposit to have any chance .
all of this is hitting the number of buy-to- let mortgages taken out .
in the first three months of this year there were 22,400 new buy to let mortgages .
even if the decline halted and each subsequent quarter were the same that would mean a total of 89,600 new buy to let mortgages being taken out in 2009 .
compare that with the height of the boom two years ago - when 346,000 buy to let mortgages were snapped up in just twelve months .
