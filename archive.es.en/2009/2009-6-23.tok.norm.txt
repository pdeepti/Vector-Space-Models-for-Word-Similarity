it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .
german technology to detect political opponents ?
nokia siemens networks spokesman ben roome told the newspaper that a " monitoring center " installed within the iranian government 's telecom monopoly was part of a larger contract with iran that included mobile phone networking technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have been turning to new technologies to communicate " if you sell networks , you also , intrinsically , sell the capability to intercept any communication that runs over them , " roome said .
the wall street journal cautioned , however , that it was not clear whether the equipment was being used specifically by the iranian authorities for dpi .
concern about misuse up to now , major trading partners like germany and italy have been reluctant to impose trade sanctions on iran .
yet calls continue for the type of deep packet inspection technology used by iran to be made illegal .
" the internet can be a tool to enhance political communication and participation in a democracy , " ed black , president and chief executive of the computer and communications industry association -lrb- ccia -rrb- , said in a statement .
" or it can become an even more intrusive way for a government to control access to information , spy on its citizens and detect political adversaries .
iran is an example of why the use of certain technologies , such as deep packet inspection , should be restricted , black said. db / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.06.2009 kenya 's vice president says his country can embark on a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka believes his country can move forward kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka says a tribunal to deal with the perpetrators of the post-election violence is not a priority .
he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

the handover marks the establishment of airbus inside the world 's fast-growing economy . the chinese-made a320 aircraft successfully completed a four-hour test flight earlier this year .
it was officially delivered at a ceremony on tuesday delivered to sichuan airlines , a regional carrier based in southwestern china , during a ceremony tuesday .
" we will build a strong future with the china aviation industry and for the china aviation industry , " airbus ceo thomas enders said tuesday .
" -lrb- airbus -rrb- will be working increasingly with our partners in china , setting new standards . "
the first airbus factory outside of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is keen produce its own products , not those of others the tianjin plant , which opened in september 2008 , is modelled after a state-of-the-art airbus factory in hamburg , germany .
the plant is a joint venture between airbus and a chinese aviation consortium and costs some 10 billion yuan -lrb- $ 1.47 billion -rrb- .
china has been an airbus customer since 1985 .
since then , chinese orders have exceeded 700 aircraft and will be supplemented by a further 10 models , scheduled to leave the tianjin plant by the end of the year . come 2011 , the factory is expected to be turning out 4 aircraft per month . the chinese aircraft market is the second largest in the world and already accounts for 15 percent of the european manufacturer 's total sales .
chinese carriers are expected to purchase as many as 3,400 new aircraft in the coming two decades , and airbus hopes to cash in on this by capturing half the chinese market by 2012 .
airbus also has its eyes on the rest of asia . at the tianjin plant 's inauguration , airbus boss enders said the factory would become " the jump off point for the future development of airbus in china and in the region . " made in china however , airbus may be wrong to expect booming business with china in the coming years . although china has long been considered the factory of the world , it is no longer satisfied with simply producing for others . in 2006 , chinese premier wen jiabao announced his country 's intention to begin construction of its own aircraft .
china sees airbus ' presence as key to realizing this goal . by working as subcontractors to boeing and airbus , the chinese have been able to learn about the construction of large passenger aircraft. as / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .

since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .

he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .

netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .
german technology to detect political opponents ?
nokia siemens networks spokesman ben roome told the newspaper that a " monitoring center " installed within the iranian government 's telecom monopoly was part of a larger contract with iran that included mobile phone networking technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have been turning to new technologies to communicate " if you sell networks , you also , intrinsically , sell the capability to intercept any communication that runs over them , " roome said .
the wall street journal cautioned , however , that it was not clear whether the equipment was being used specifically by the iranian authorities for dpi .
concern about misuse up to now , major trading partners like germany and italy have been reluctant to impose trade sanctions on iran .
yet calls continue for the type of deep packet inspection technology used by iran to be made illegal .
" the internet can be a tool to enhance political communication and participation in a democracy , " ed black , president and chief executive of the computer and communications industry association -lrb- ccia -rrb- , said in a statement .
" or it can become an even more intrusive way for a government to control access to information , spy on its citizens and detect political adversaries .
iran is an example of why the use of certain technologies , such as deep packet inspection , should be restricted , black said. db / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .

he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .
settlement question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish settlements have been built and bulldozed in gaza on wednesday , the israeli premier is slated to meet italian president girogio napolitano before travelling to paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.06.2009 kenya 's vice president says his country can embark on a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka believes his country can move forward kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka says a tribunal to deal with the perpetrators of the post-election violence is not a priority .
he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .

nokia siemens networks spokesman ben roome told the newspaper that a " monitoring center " installed within the iranian government 's telecom monopoly was part of a larger contract with iran that included mobile phone networking technology .

the wall street journal cautioned , however , that it was not clear whether the equipment was being used specifically by the iranian authorities for dpi .
concern about misuse up to now , major trading partners like germany and italy have been reluctant to impose trade sanctions on iran .
yet calls continue for the type of deep packet inspection technology used by iran to be made illegal .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .
german technology to detect political opponents ?
nokia siemens networks spokesman ben roome told the newspaper that a " monitoring center " installed within the iranian government 's telecom monopoly was part of a larger contract with iran that included mobile phone networking technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have been turning to new technologies to communicate " if you sell networks , you also , intrinsically , sell the capability to intercept any communication that runs over them , " roome said .
the wall street journal cautioned , however , that it was not clear whether the equipment was being used specifically by the iranian authorities for dpi .
concern about misuse up to now , major trading partners like germany and italy have been reluctant to impose trade sanctions on iran .
yet calls continue for the type of deep packet inspection technology used by iran to be made illegal .
" the internet can be a tool to enhance political communication and participation in a democracy , " ed black , president and chief executive of the computer and communications industry association -lrb- ccia -rrb- , said in a statement .

it had formerly been granted to minsk in 1992 but was withdrawn in 1997 " due to lack of progress in the human rights sphere . "
belarus is the only european country that is not a member of the council of europe , and according to amnesty international , it 's the only european country that still has the death penalty .
a moratorium on the execution of prisoners is a precondition to belarus taking up its special guest status .
the move coincides with the eu 's recently launched " eastern partnership , " which aims to improve ties with six former soviet republics , including belarus .
talks between minsk and brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and ferrero-waldner during talks in minsk ahead of tuesday 's decision , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner visited minsk for talks with belarusian officials including president alexander lukashenko .
she described the talks as a " good start and a milestone in relations " between belarus and the eu .
the country recently freed all political prisoners and made other concessions to democracy , which ferrero-waldner welcomed .
" these are very positive steps , but let us be clear , " she said in an online interview with radio free europe .
" much more needs still to be done , and belarus has a long way to go . "
she cited press freedom , freedom of expression for civil society and better working conditions for ngos as issues at the top of the list of priorities .

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .

they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .
the last german fatality in the kunduz region occurred at the end of april when a soldier was killed in an ambush. wl / ap / dpa / afp editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .

he has now become a special envoy to china for economic affairs , and is using his celebrity status to lure chinese investors to north rhine-westphalia . timo boll is a very busy person .
ranked number three in the world , the table tennis champion has a tight training schedule .
apart from all the tournaments and competitions , he also has to attend sponsoring events .
and as if he didn ’ t have enough to do , timo boll is now also trying to boost the attractiveness of north rhine-westphalia as a business hub .
the star athlete is a perfect advertisement for germany ’ s most populous state .
earlier this year , the state ’ s economy minister , christa thoben , went to china with a business delegation .
and timo boll .
he met economics students from beijing university and discussed concepts such as fair play and success .
he also demonstrated some of his skills .
" i played some table tennis with some business students , " boll says . " they might be the top managers of the future , leading big corporations .
and later might be interested in investing their money in germany , especially in north rhine-westphalia .
this might have been the right step but it was especially a lot of fun - for me and the students . "
attracting investors at the beginning of 2009 , north rhine-westphalia launched a campaign to attract more investment .
the slogan - " wir lieben das neue " or " we love new " - is directed at china .
there are currently some 600 chinese investors doing business in the state and the government is eager to deepen economic ties .
last year , the volume of sino-german trade reached 21 billion euros .
for timo boll , his new job is an opportunity to get a glimpse behind the scenes .
and to learn something new .
maybe it will come in handy in future , he says .
" i have to adapt to the new tasks and i have to learn .
but i am willing to learn .
i am 28 years old and much more open to other things .
you can not be a sports athlete forever .
therefore , it ’ s good to get a taste of the business world . "
china experience timo boll is well qualified for working in china .
he became a superstar , playing table tennis in china ’ s elite league for six months .
" i think that i am , in a way , predestined for this kind of job .
i love visiting china , i like the country very much and i like the people .
i think i can be a very good link between china and germany because i have experience with china .
i know the country and its people just like germany .
maybe i will benefit from it in the future . "
but sport still has top priority in timo boll ’ s life .
whether he joins the next business delegation travelling to china in october will depend on his table tennis schedule .
however , he hopes he can combine business with sport and is happy that he can work with both sides - china and germany .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .
german technology to detect political opponents ?
nokia siemens networks spokesman ben roome told the newspaper that a " monitoring center " installed within the iranian government 's telecom monopoly was part of a larger contract with iran that included mobile phone networking technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have been turning to new technologies to communicate " if you sell networks , you also , intrinsically , sell the capability to intercept any communication that runs over them , " roome said .
the wall street journal cautioned , however , that it was not clear whether the equipment was being used specifically by the iranian authorities for dpi .
concern about misuse up to now , major trading partners like germany and italy have been reluctant to impose trade sanctions on iran .
yet calls continue for the type of deep packet inspection technology used by iran to be made illegal .
" the internet can be a tool to enhance political communication and participation in a democracy , " ed black , president and chief executive of the computer and communications industry association -lrb- ccia -rrb- , said in a statement .
" or it can become an even more intrusive way for a government to control access to information , spy on its citizens and detect political adversaries .
iran is an example of why the use of certain technologies , such as deep packet inspection , should be restricted , black said. db / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .
the ifo business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe. dfm / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .
settlement question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish settlements have been built and bulldozed in gaza on wednesday , the israeli premier is slated to meet italian president girogio napolitano before travelling to paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .
settlement question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish settlements have been built and bulldozed in gaza on wednesday , the israeli premier is slated to meet italian president girogio napolitano before travelling to paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .
the last german fatality in the kunduz region occurred at the end of april when a soldier was killed in an ambush. wl / ap / dpa / afp editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday french president nicolas sarkozy said the head-to-toe veil was not welcome in secular france . the inquiry was announced one day after french president nicolas sarkozy held an historic address to parliament , where he said the islamic body-length outfit known as the “ burqa ” was not a symbol of religious faith but signalled a woman 's subservience .
the inquiry is intended to establish whether this is the case .
the french president said he clearly supported measures to discourage muslim women from fully covering themselves in france .
starting in july , 32 lawmakers from right-wing and leftist parties will study the wearing of the islamic face-covering , body-length outfits in france .
more than five million muslims live in france , making them the largest muslim minority in western europe .
ever more french muslim women are wearing burqas and niqabs , which either cover the entire body , or cover everything but the eyes .
human rights watch said a ban would violate religious freedom .
" prohibiting the burqa will not give women freedom but only stigmatise and marginalise women who wear it , " said jean-marie fardeau , director of the paris office of human rights watch .
france passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or any other " conspicuous " religious symbols in state schools to defend secularism .

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .
settlement question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish settlements have been built and bulldozed in gaza on wednesday , the israeli premier is slated to meet italian president girogio napolitano before travelling to paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .
settlement question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish settlements have been built and bulldozed in gaza on wednesday , the israeli premier is slated to meet italian president girogio napolitano before travelling to paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .

then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .

he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .

on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .
german technology to detect political opponents ?
nokia siemens networks spokesman ben roome told the newspaper that a " monitoring center " installed within the iranian government 's telecom monopoly was part of a larger contract with iran that included mobile phone networking technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have been turning to new technologies to communicate " if you sell networks , you also , intrinsically , sell the capability to intercept any communication that runs over them , " roome said .
the wall street journal cautioned , however , that it was not clear whether the equipment was being used specifically by the iranian authorities for dpi .
concern about misuse up to now , major trading partners like germany and italy have been reluctant to impose trade sanctions on iran .
yet calls continue for the type of deep packet inspection technology used by iran to be made illegal .
" the internet can be a tool to enhance political communication and participation in a democracy , " ed black , president and chief executive of the computer and communications industry association -lrb- ccia -rrb- , said in a statement .
" or it can become an even more intrusive way for a government to control access to information , spy on its citizens and detect political adversaries .
iran is an example of why the use of certain technologies , such as deep packet inspection , should be restricted , black said. db / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .

the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .

he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
netanyahu was expected to ask italy once again to reconsider its commercial links with the islamic republic .
settlement question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish settlements have been built and bulldozed in gaza on wednesday , the israeli premier is slated to meet italian president girogio napolitano before travelling to paris for talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
he will also holds talks with us middle east envoy george mitchell .
netanyahu , who took office after february elections , will not make the journey to european heavyweight germany during his trip , but told german daily bild he hoped to visit soon .
in an interview published monday and tuesday , he said he planned to accept an invitation from german chancellor angela merkel , who he said he greatly admired , adding that she was a truly reliable friend of israel .
the contentious issue of israeli settlement in the occupied west bank is also likely to be discussed during netanyahu 's trip , with reports tuesday the jewish state has authorized the building of as many as 300 new homes in the region .
the move would flout calls by the international community , in particular the us , for israel to abandon new settlements in the west bank in a bid to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .
the last german fatality in the kunduz region occurred at the end of april when a soldier was killed in an ambush. wl / ap / dpa / afp editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .

then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .

he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .
the ifo business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe. dfm / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .
the last german fatality in the kunduz region occurred at the end of april when a soldier was killed in an ambush. wl / ap / dpa / afp editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.06.2009 critics say tax-evasion agreements lack the necessary bite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland wants to better its image , but is it prepared to change ?
with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .
the ifo business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe. dfm / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.06.2009 critics say tax-evasion agreements lack the necessary bite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland wants to better its image , but is it prepared to change ?
with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "

" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .
the ifo business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe. dfm / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday french president nicolas sarkozy said the head-to-toe veil was not welcome in secular france . the inquiry was announced one day after french president nicolas sarkozy held an historic address to parliament , where he said the islamic body-length outfit known as the “ burqa ” was not a symbol of religious faith but signalled a woman 's subservience .
the inquiry is intended to establish whether this is the case .
the french president said he clearly supported measures to discourage muslim women from fully covering themselves in france .
starting in july , 32 lawmakers from right-wing and leftist parties will study the wearing of the islamic face-covering , body-length outfits in france .
more than five million muslims live in france , making them the largest muslim minority in western europe .
ever more french muslim women are wearing burqas and niqabs , which either cover the entire body , or cover everything but the eyes .
human rights watch said a ban would violate religious freedom .
" prohibiting the burqa will not give women freedom but only stigmatise and marginalise women who wear it , " said jean-marie fardeau , director of the paris office of human rights watch .
france passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or any other " conspicuous " religious symbols in state schools to defend secularism .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de critics say tax-evasion agreements lack the necessary bite with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities .
-lrb- 23.06.2009 -rrb- new legislation seeks to close tax haven loopholes after weeks of political wrangling , germany 's ruling coalition has reached agreement on a draft law to combat tax evasion .
the revised draft law is to be presented to chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet on wednesday .

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .
if it does so , the country would finally conform to the oecd standards , and could then be taken off the grey list. uh / afp / ips / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .

since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .
german technology to detect political opponents ?
nokia siemens networks spokesman ben roome told the newspaper that a " monitoring center " installed within the iranian government 's telecom monopoly was part of a larger contract with iran that included mobile phone networking technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have been turning to new technologies to communicate " if you sell networks , you also , intrinsically , sell the capability to intercept any communication that runs over them , " roome said .
the wall street journal cautioned , however , that it was not clear whether the equipment was being used specifically by the iranian authorities for dpi .
concern about misuse up to now , major trading partners like germany and italy have been reluctant to impose trade sanctions on iran .
yet calls continue for the type of deep packet inspection technology used by iran to be made illegal .
" the internet can be a tool to enhance political communication and participation in a democracy , " ed black , president and chief executive of the computer and communications industry association -lrb- ccia -rrb- , said in a statement .
" or it can become an even more intrusive way for a government to control access to information , spy on its citizens and detect political adversaries .
iran is an example of why the use of certain technologies , such as deep packet inspection , should be restricted , black said. db / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .

on monday french president nicolas sarkozy said the head-to-toe veil was not welcome in secular france . the inquiry was announced one day after french president nicolas sarkozy held an historic address to parliament , where he said the islamic body-length outfit known as the “ burqa ” was not a symbol of religious faith but signalled a woman 's subservience .
the inquiry is intended to establish whether this is the case .
the french president said he clearly supported measures to discourage muslim women from fully covering themselves in france .
starting in july , 32 lawmakers from right-wing and leftist parties will study the wearing of the islamic face-covering , body-length outfits in france .
more than five million muslims live in france , making them the largest muslim minority in western europe .
ever more french muslim women are wearing burqas and niqabs , which either cover the entire body , or cover everything but the eyes .
human rights watch said a ban would violate religious freedom .
" prohibiting the burqa will not give women freedom but only stigmatise and marginalise women who wear it , " said jean-marie fardeau , director of the paris office of human rights watch .
france passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or any other " conspicuous " religious symbols in state schools to defend secularism .
in france , the separation of church and state is enshrined in a 1905 law. wl / ap / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it had formerly been granted to minsk in 1992 but was withdrawn in 1997 " due to lack of progress in the human rights sphere . "
belarus is the only european country that is not a member of the council of europe , and according to amnesty international , it 's the only european country that still has the death penalty .
a moratorium on the execution of prisoners is a precondition to belarus taking up its special guest status .
the move coincides with the eu 's recently launched " eastern partnership , " which aims to improve ties with six former soviet republics , including belarus .
talks between minsk and brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and ferrero-waldner during talks in minsk ahead of tuesday 's decision , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner visited minsk for talks with belarusian officials including president alexander lukashenko .
she described the talks as a " good start and a milestone in relations " between belarus and the eu .
the country recently freed all political prisoners and made other concessions to democracy , which ferrero-waldner welcomed .
" these are very positive steps , but let us be clear , " she said in an online interview with radio free europe .
" much more needs still to be done , and belarus has a long way to go . "
she cited press freedom , freedom of expression for civil society and better working conditions for ngos as issues at the top of the list of priorities .
although it 's been referred to as " europe 's last dictatorship , " belarus has shown its interest in building good relations with the rest of europe , despite the disapproval of its closest ally , russia. dc / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de lukashenko pursues old tactics , not new strategy despite overtures to the eu and a recent row with russia , belarus is n't going to turn away from its big neighbor any time soon .
instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy .
-lrb- 22.06.2009 -rrb- eu forges new eastern partnership in prague the european union has just launched a new eastern partnership plan with six former soviet states .

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .
the last german fatality in the kunduz region occurred at the end of april when a soldier was killed in an ambush. wl / ap / dpa / afp editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it had formerly been granted to minsk in 1992 but was withdrawn in 1997 " due to lack of progress in the human rights sphere . "
belarus is the only european country that is not a member of the council of europe , and according to amnesty international , it 's the only european country that still has the death penalty .
a moratorium on the execution of prisoners is a precondition to belarus taking up its special guest status .
the move coincides with the eu 's recently launched " eastern partnership , " which aims to improve ties with six former soviet republics , including belarus .
talks between minsk and brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and ferrero-waldner during talks in minsk ahead of tuesday 's decision , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner visited minsk for talks with belarusian officials including president alexander lukashenko .
she described the talks as a " good start and a milestone in relations " between belarus and the eu .
the country recently freed all political prisoners and made other concessions to democracy , which ferrero-waldner welcomed .
" these are very positive steps , but let us be clear , " she said in an online interview with radio free europe .
" much more needs still to be done , and belarus has a long way to go . "
she cited press freedom , freedom of expression for civil society and better working conditions for ngos as issues at the top of the list of priorities .

it had formerly been granted to minsk in 1992 but was withdrawn in 1997 " due to lack of progress in the human rights sphere . "
belarus is the only european country that is not a member of the council of europe , and according to amnesty international , it 's the only european country that still has the death penalty .
a moratorium on the execution of prisoners is a precondition to belarus taking up its special guest status .
the move coincides with the eu 's recently launched " eastern partnership , " which aims to improve ties with six former soviet republics , including belarus .
talks between minsk and brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and ferrero-waldner during talks in minsk ahead of tuesday 's decision , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner visited minsk for talks with belarusian officials including president alexander lukashenko .
she described the talks as a " good start and a milestone in relations " between belarus and the eu .
the country recently freed all political prisoners and made other concessions to democracy , which ferrero-waldner welcomed .
" these are very positive steps , but let us be clear , " she said in an online interview with radio free europe .
" much more needs still to be done , and belarus has a long way to go . "
she cited press freedom , freedom of expression for civil society and better working conditions for ngos as issues at the top of the list of priorities .
although it 's been referred to as " europe 's last dictatorship , " belarus has shown its interest in building good relations with the rest of europe , despite the disapproval of its closest ally , russia. dc / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it had formerly been granted to minsk in 1992 but was withdrawn in 1997 " due to lack of progress in the human rights sphere . "
belarus is the only european country that is not a member of the council of europe , and according to amnesty international , it 's the only european country that still has the death penalty .
a moratorium on the execution of prisoners is a precondition to belarus taking up its special guest status .
the move coincides with the eu 's recently launched " eastern partnership , " which aims to improve ties with six former soviet republics , including belarus .
talks between minsk and brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and ferrero-waldner during talks in minsk ahead of tuesday 's decision , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner visited minsk for talks with belarusian officials including president alexander lukashenko .
she described the talks as a " good start and a milestone in relations " between belarus and the eu .
the country recently freed all political prisoners and made other concessions to democracy , which ferrero-waldner welcomed .
" these are very positive steps , but let us be clear , " she said in an online interview with radio free europe .
" much more needs still to be done , and belarus has a long way to go . "
she cited press freedom , freedom of expression for civil society and better working conditions for ngos as issues at the top of the list of priorities .
although it 's been referred to as " europe 's last dictatorship , " belarus has shown its interest in building good relations with the rest of europe , despite the disapproval of its closest ally , russia. dc / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .
the last german fatality in the kunduz region occurred at the end of april when a soldier was killed in an ambush. wl / ap / dpa / afp editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday french president nicolas sarkozy said the head-to-toe veil was not welcome in secular france . the inquiry was announced one day after french president nicolas sarkozy held an historic address to parliament , where he said the islamic body-length outfit known as the “ burqa ” was not a symbol of religious faith but signalled a woman 's subservience .
the inquiry is intended to establish whether this is the case .
the french president said he clearly supported measures to discourage muslim women from fully covering themselves in france .
starting in july , 32 lawmakers from right-wing and leftist parties will study the wearing of the islamic face-covering , body-length outfits in france .
more than five million muslims live in france , making them the largest muslim minority in western europe .
ever more french muslim women are wearing burqas and niqabs , which either cover the entire body , or cover everything but the eyes .
human rights watch said a ban would violate religious freedom .
" prohibiting the burqa will not give women freedom but only stigmatise and marginalise women who wear it , " said jean-marie fardeau , director of the paris office of human rights watch .
france passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or any other " conspicuous " religious symbols in state schools to defend secularism .
in france , the separation of church and state is enshrined in a 1905 law. wl / ap / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .

siemens and nokia have reportedly supplied iran with spying technology . according to the wall street journal , iranian authorities appear to be using deep packet inspection -lrb- dpi -rrb- technologies to intercept data on the internet as well as monitor and block web communications .
iranians are increasingly posting videos of the clashes on sites like youtube and are also using social media sites like twitter and facebook . this technology has become a means of communication among protestors following the country 's controversial presidential election that returned incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power . the us newspaper says that the government 's ability to monitor its citizens was provided , at least in part , by nokia siemens networks .
the joint venture was undertaken by german conglomerate siemens and finnish cellphone company nokia in late 2008 .

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

analysts had predicted the july index would stand at around 2.5 points .
gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .
" following the recent growing number of signs that the economic downturn may be coming to an end , consumer hopes of economic stabilization are intensifying and accordingly , economic expectations are increasing moderately , " the statement said .
" the fact that the employment market has remained fairly robust is likely to be one reason for this .
however , the consumer climate remains at a low level overall . "
gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .
the institute said german government efforts to safeguard jobs have kept the market unusually flexible despite the economic downturn , and that consumers were spending their money on purchases rather than investments .
another key economic index , released monday , showed that german business confidence rose for a third straight month in june , making larger than expected gains to 85.9 points , following a lower than expected rise in may to 84.2 points .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.06.2009 kenya 's vice president says his country can embark on a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka believes his country can move forward kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka says a tribunal to deal with the perpetrators of the post-election violence is not a priority .
he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.06.2009 kenya 's vice president says his country can embark on a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka believes his country can move forward kenya 's vice president kalonzo musyoka says a tribunal to deal with the perpetrators of the post-election violence is not a priority .
he tells deutsche welle about his country 's political and economic future . deutsche welle : what was the purpose of your visit to germany ?
kalonzo musyoka : i was invited to germany by friends who organized every year what has now come to be called -lrb- as -rrb- the berlin gathering .
this is a gathering that brings together people from all over the world to be able to discuss issues based on the principle of understanding within the biblical meaning of the word .
but they also take the opportunity to address world issues .
like now the theme for the 14th edition of the gathering was “ responsibility before man and before god in the face of the current financial crisis . ”
this is my third time to attend this gathering and it does promote a lot of understanding including an element of conflict resolution .
back home in kenya some still witness a continuation of the power struggle among partners in the coalition government .
why have you failed as a government so far to find a common ground ?
but in any coalition government , you will agree with me that there are always disagreements .
in fact we borrowed heavily as kenya from the example of germany – where they have a grand coalition government .
now they are going to elections in september and you hear them talking in different languages because naturally that is expected of any coalition government .
so when we have our little quarrels … the world should not take it as if there is a power struggle because there is no power struggle .
you said there is no power struggle in kenya but recently kenyans hailed speaker kenneth marende when he made that landmark ruling by appointing himself the leader of government business .
in your view how long will the status quo remain ?
you see that was a momentary thing and a lot of water has gone under the ground .
by the way he did not appoint himself leader of government business .
what he did was that he was going to chair the house business committee .
now these are two separate organs .
the house business committee is a committee that is charged with the responsibility of agreeing on the government agenda before parliament .
but the leader of government business is a completely different person and the speaker can not play that role because it is the executive 's business to set the program for debate in the house and it can not therefore be that the legislature in this case headed by the speaker does both the work of the executive and the legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan -lrb- left -rrb- helped to broker a power-sharing deal between kenyan president mwai kibaki -lrb- center -rrb- and prime minister raila odinga former un secretary-general kofi annan has given the kenyan government a deadline by august if there is no special tribunal to deal with perpetrators of the post-election violence then it 's all the way to the hague .
prime minister raila odinga as well as president mwai kibaki have supported annan .
what is your stand or rather position on this issue ?
both the president , the prime minister and i unfortunately we were able to lose in the vote because various mps held different views .
we have said we will make another attempt at trying to convince parliament to agree to set up a local tribunal as opposed to the international tribunal at the hague .
but this is work under progress .
again , it should not be the cause for any measure of tension because the country must heal .
we have already set up the truth , justice and reconciliation committee , which is supposed to spearhead the work of national healing and reconciliation .
therefore to me issues of the hague or not the hague , tribunal or no tribunal should be secondary to the fact that kenyans are working at forgiveness and of course agreeing that some of these issues will be better be addressed under new constitution dispensation which is what we are working on .
mr. vice president as we all know that the next general elections in kenya are due in 2012 where kalonzo musyoka will once again be the presidential candidate ?
we will cross that bridge when we get to it .
right now we want to involve a culture of how to work .
we are dealing with a situation which is undermined by the serious famine and poverty .
we have to carry out what we are calling agenda of the serena talks -lrb- name of the hotel where the reconcilation talks were held-ed . -rrb- under kofi annan , talks which were able to identify the salient features of the challenges facing the country including youth unemployment and the need to bring social harmony and cohesion .
kalonzo musyoka is kenya 's vice president .

gfk said the survey results indicated that consumers ' economic and income expectations were on the increase and the propensity to buy was also improving slightly .

gfk canvassed around 2,000 consumers for the survey , which measures overall sentiment with subsections covering personal income expectations , general views of the economy and the likelihood of making large purchases .

on monday french president nicolas sarkozy said the head-to-toe veil was not welcome in secular france . the inquiry was announced one day after french president nicolas sarkozy held an historic address to parliament , where he said the islamic body-length outfit known as the “ burqa ” was not a symbol of religious faith but signalled a woman 's subservience .
the inquiry is intended to establish whether this is the case .
the french president said he clearly supported measures to discourage muslim women from fully covering themselves in france .
starting in july , 32 lawmakers from right-wing and leftist parties will study the wearing of the islamic face-covering , body-length outfits in france .
more than five million muslims live in france , making them the largest muslim minority in western europe .
ever more french muslim women are wearing burqas and niqabs , which either cover the entire body , or cover everything but the eyes .
human rights watch said a ban would violate religious freedom .
" prohibiting the burqa will not give women freedom but only stigmatise and marginalise women who wear it , " said jean-marie fardeau , director of the paris office of human rights watch .
france passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or any other " conspicuous " religious symbols in state schools to defend secularism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.06.2009 critics say tax-evasion agreements lack the necessary bite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland wants to better its image , but is it prepared to change ?
with the onset of the global financial crisis , governments vowed to get tough on tax havens like switzerland .
but the deals reached , say detractors , wo n't end the practice of using secret accounts to cheat authorities . the meeting between 19 member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in berlin on tuesday was but the latest step in a highly touted international initiative to crack down on tax evaders .
estimates of the amount of taxable money hidden in secret bank accounts around the world range between $ 1.7-11.5 trillion -lrb- 1.2-8.3 trillion euros -rrb- .
with most major governments spending massively on stimulus programs to offset the global economic downturn , revenues from these funds would come in very handy .
a number of large industrialized nations have announced agreements in recent weeks with countries accused of being tax havens - from switzerland and luxembourg to bermuda and the bahamas .
but as the example of switzerland shows , the devil is in the details .
" banking secrecy is only suspended in case of concrete suspicion , when the name -lsb- of the account holder -rsb- and bank are specified , " swiss banking expert manuel ammann told deutsche welle .
" and from experience , we know such concrete cases do n't occur all that often . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post chairman klaus zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasion last year the practice of using foreign accounts to hide money from tax authorities , say critics , is likely to continue as long as requests for information have to be made on a case-by-case basis .
" it 's an arduous and ineffective path , " andreas missbach , an expert on swiss banking for the swiss ngo erklaerung von bern , told deutsche welle .
" the agreements between switzerland and countries like the us only apply to individual requests , and it 's unclear whether they are retroactive .
switzerland would like to keep the illicit money . "
all in all , missbach said , the attempt to rid the world of tax havens is " toothless . "
populist measure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary-general angel gurria is trying to convince countries to cooperate the oecd has been trying to bring about reforms in this area for more than a decade and has been taking the lead in current attempts to increase international banking transparency .
experts form the organization 's member states have formulated a set of standards , to which countries are expected to adhere .
they mandate " the exchange of information on request where it is ' foreseeably relevant ' to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the treaty partner , " as well as the lifting of " restrictions on exchange caused by bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements . "
switzerland has taken steps to conform to these standards and is currently on the oecd 's " grey list " of tax havens , indicating those countries that are willing to cooperate more but have so far failed to provide enough transparency .
but the organization itself is a coordinating body and not an international financial policeman .
" the oecd works on the basis of a mandate from its member countries , " matthias rumpf , the press spokesman for organization 's berlin office told deutsche welle .
" the actual process is in the hands of individual states .
we accompany and support this process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is another country that 's come under fire the best chance for meaningful change may be public outrage that some individuals and companies are cheating their national tax authorities , while ordinary people are asked to foot larger and larger bills .
" the basic mood has changed and a lot more is known about tax havens , " missbach said .
" that 's put governments under pressure .
but going after tax havens is not their priority .
it 's a half-hearted affair . "
political considerations individual countries have to balance their desire to track down cheats with their need to get along with major economic and financial partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck , right , is back on cordial terms with his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz last year , german finance minister peer steinbrueck raised hackles in switzerland by calling for it to be put on the oecd 's black list .
summits like the one in berlin are as much about mending fences as fundamental reform .
" burying the hatchet is part of the agenda , " missbach said .
" no one is interested in disrupting that . "
after the g20 summit in london this april , the organization proudly proclaimed : " the era of banking secrecy is over . "
but in reality that 's far from being the case .
" the us has also had to be satisfied with how switzerland is implementing current oecd standards , " ammann said .
" and if that 's the case , you can safely say there 's no threat to switzerland or its banking secrecy . "
and while the public debate has largely focused on wealthy countries , there 's a lot riding on the outcome of the process for the world 's poorer nations as well - which depend on the rich ones for aid . " the general tendency and direction has to be toward the automatic sharing of information , " missbach said .
" that 's going to be crucial for developing countries . "
but for many decades , tax havens have been the dirty , not-so-secret secret of the international financial world .
and it 's hard to imagine them being eradicated any time in the near future .

it was called by german finance minister peer steinbrueck and his french counterpart eric woerth , and was aimed at intensifying the struggle against cross-border tax evasion .
after the meeting , steinbrueck said he was " extraordinarily satisfied " with the results , which constituted " substantial progress . "
in a final document , the 20 finance ministers agreed to toughen measures against countries which fail to implement oecd tax standards .
national governments are called upon to scrap tax benefits for businesses dealing with such " non-cooperative " countries .
in addition , it was suggested that higher taxes should be levied on financial transfers to tax havens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the countries promising to cooperate with the oecd getting off the " grey list " the talks follow a similar meeting in paris on october 21 , 2008 .
then , it was decided that governments should crack down on tax havens said to be partly responsible for the kinds of upheavals in financial markets that lead to the current economic crisis .
since the year 2000 , the oecd has blacklisted countries which fail to comply with the organisation 's tax standards , and suggested imposing sanctions on them .
at the moment , there are no entries in the oecd ’ s black list , as countries considered tax havens - including among others andorra , austria , liechtenstein , luxembourg , and switzerland - promised to cooperate with the oecd .
however , they are still listed on a " grey list " which names countries that have not yet implemented the oecd standards .
the oecd also requires that these countries sign bilateral tax information agreements with a minimum of 12 industrialized nations before they can be scrapped from the grey list .
steinbrueck the taskmaster steinbrueck has been a vocal critic of international tax havens , and has pressed for sanctions against countries aiding tax evasion .
according to the german taxpayers ‘ federation , berlin loses an estimated 30 billion euros in taxes each year - money that often ends up in the vaults of banks in switzerland , luxembourg and other tax havens bordering on germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck and his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz steinbrueck has presented sweeping new laws against tax dodging under which all financial transfers to tax havens must be declared .
the german finance minister has also caused a diplomatic rift with switzerland and luxembourg recently , as he compared taxation rules there with those allegedly existing in ouagadougou , the capital of the african nation of burkina faso .
he also suggested that other countries should " crack the whip " on the swiss to combat tax evasion and bank secrecy .
but on tuesday , steinbrueck explicitly praised switzerland , luxembourg and austria for supporting the oecd measures .
on monday , switzerland agreed to negotiate a new double taxation agreement with germany .
after talks with steinbrueck in berlin , the swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz said his country would seek to introduce legislation easing the country 's bank secrecy as quickly as possible .
he also said swiss banks would be obliged to exchange tax data in response to a " well-founded request " from other countries .
the swiss government hopes to ratify a dozen accords governing double taxation practices by the end of the year .

but at their joint press conference , he focused on iran , praising the courage of iranian protesters and calling tehran the " greatest threat to peace " in the region .
netanyahu said that the protesters were showing courage " in facing bullets in the streets " as iranian authorities attempt to crack down on the demonstrations against alleged fraud in the recent election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
berlusconi added that he and netanyahu were in agreement that iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons .
italy is one of iran 's biggest trade partners in europe , and israel has in the past asked rome to use its economic ties to put pressure on tehran over its controversial nuclear program .

on monday french president nicolas sarkozy said the head-to-toe veil was not welcome in secular france . the inquiry was announced one day after french president nicolas sarkozy held an historic address to parliament , where he said the islamic body-length outfit known as the “ burqa ” was not a symbol of religious faith but signalled a woman 's subservience .
the inquiry is intended to establish whether this is the case .
the french president said he clearly supported measures to discourage muslim women from fully covering themselves in france .
starting in july , 32 lawmakers from right-wing and leftist parties will study the wearing of the islamic face-covering , body-length outfits in france .
more than five million muslims live in france , making them the largest muslim minority in western europe .
ever more french muslim women are wearing burqas and niqabs , which either cover the entire body , or cover everything but the eyes .
human rights watch said a ban would violate religious freedom .
" prohibiting the burqa will not give women freedom but only stigmatise and marginalise women who wear it , " said jean-marie fardeau , director of the paris office of human rights watch .
france passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or any other " conspicuous " religious symbols in state schools to defend secularism .
in france , the separation of church and state is enshrined in a 1905 law. wl / ap / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the exact circumstances of their deaths remain uncertain . the soldiers died when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed and overturned outside the northern provincial capital of kunduz on tuesday .
two of the men in the vehicle died instantly and a third died later of his injuries .
taliban militants had attacked the soldiers ' patrol with light arms and rockets , but it is unclear whether their vehicle overturned during the attack or later while returning to base .
the crash occurred some six kilometers from the german headquarters in kunduz .
german defense minister franz joseph jung said an investigation would be launched into the soldiers ' deaths , which bring the total number of bundeswehr casualties in afghanistan to 35 .
he said that the troops " died in the cause of peace , " but added that their deaths would not deter germany from participating in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission to stabilize afghanistan .
there are around 3,800 german soldiers in afghanistan , 1,100 of them in the kunduz region .
germany is the third-largest contributor to isaf , but the mission is becoming increasingly unpopular at home .
a recent survey found that around six in ten germans would prefer to see berlin bring the troops home .
the last german fatality in the kunduz region occurred at the end of april when a soldier was killed in an ambush. wl / ap / dpa / afp editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 23.06.2009 cat meets mouse at the german customs museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these days , most smugglers do n't bother with just a few packs of cigarettes nearly 1,000 customs officials are employed in hamburg , one of europe 's most important port cities .
much of what they find - from prosthetic limbs to counterfeit watches - is put on display in the customs museum . the german customs museum in hamburg is full of curious finds : things that smugglers had hoped to carry over the border , but were found and confiscated by a customs officer instead . dieter schmidt worked as a customs officer on the inner german border until east and west germany were reunified in 1990 .
now he shows visitors around the museum . schmidt pointed to a prosthetic leg on display , explaining that it used to belong to a veteran after the second world war .
at a time when the old german currency - the reichmark - was n't worth anything , and american cigarettes were traded instead of money , the vet was able to smuggle two or three packs of cigarettes in the hollow space he had carved into his artificial leg . one us cigarette cost eight to 10 reichsmark , said schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's port is the third largest in europe " if you think that a skilled laborer earned one reichmark per hour at that time , it was a worthwhile business , " added the former customs officer .
schmidt then pointed out a motorcycle tank that was used to smuggle coffee . european integration changes face of smuggling the cat-and-mouse game between customs official and smuggler , detective and criminal mind , is n't just a thing of the wartime past .
these days , however , it plays out in a different setting . as sales tax slowly but surely evens out across europe , it 's no longer worth smuggling just a pack or two of cigarettes at a time .
only mass deliveries of alcohol or tobacco can make any real money .
that means average tourists are less interesting for customs officials than they used to be , said german government spokesman arne petrick . people are allowed to bring 430 euros -lrb- nearly $ 600 -rrb- worth of goods into a country without paying tax , explained petrick .
plus , up to 200 cigarettes and " a good amount of alcohol " can be brought over borders without having to pay . " normal travelers should be happy about that , " he said . but trying to stem the loss of tax revenues is only one job of a customs officer .
other things are n't allowed to cross borders , like weapons and certain types of animals and plants .
a major customs issue is the breach of international accords on species protections . " this wolf was poisoned , " explained schmidt , showing off a stuffed specimen . " someone threw him poisoned chunks of meat from a helicopter , that 's why there is no damage to the fur from a gunshot wound .
it was supposed to be displayed in the window of a gun shop - but now it ’ s on display in our museum . " counterfeiters hijack brand names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customs offers destroy the counterfeit products they confiscate other displays show tennis shoes , luxury watches and leather motorcycle jackets - all counterfeit . in the 1980s , the markets for counterfeit goods were in sporting goods and watches .
today , many more things are copied - or at least brand names are often misused .
this applies to everything from knives marked " solingen " to cuckoo clocks supposedly from the " black forest , " to items allegedly " made in switzerland . " " customers associate a certain quality standard with all these brand names .
plagiarists like to take these terms and use them to make their own products look or seem better , " petrick explained . in 2008 , trade in fake goods traveling through the port of hamburg reached new dimensions , with the value of confiscated goods rising from 200 to nearly 235 million euros . and as long as the criminal minds continue creating counterfeit objects or finding new ways to smuggle , the detectives will keep chasing them .
and the exhibit at the customs museum in hamburg will continue to amaze non-criminal minds . author : ute hempelmann -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it had formerly been granted to minsk in 1992 but was withdrawn in 1997 " due to lack of progress in the human rights sphere . "
belarus is the only european country that is not a member of the council of europe , and according to amnesty international , it 's the only european country that still has the death penalty .
a moratorium on the execution of prisoners is a precondition to belarus taking up its special guest status .
the move coincides with the eu 's recently launched " eastern partnership , " which aims to improve ties with six former soviet republics , including belarus .
talks between minsk and brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and ferrero-waldner during talks in minsk ahead of tuesday 's decision , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner visited minsk for talks with belarusian officials including president alexander lukashenko .
she described the talks as a " good start and a milestone in relations " between belarus and the eu .
the country recently freed all political prisoners and made other concessions to democracy , which ferrero-waldner welcomed .
" these are very positive steps , but let us be clear , " she said in an online interview with radio free europe .
" much more needs still to be done , and belarus has a long way to go . "
she cited press freedom , freedom of expression for civil society and better working conditions for ngos as issues at the top of the list of priorities .

advertisement footage claiming to show a rally near tehran 's shiroudi stadium on monday united nations secretary general ban ki-moon has called for an immediate end to arrests and the threat and use of violence by authorities in iran .
he urged them to respect fundamental civil rights , " especially the freedom of assembly and expression " .
his comments came as there were further clashes in the capital tehran .
iran 's legislative body , the guardian council , said there were no major polling irregularities in the 12 june election and ruled out an annulment .
the ruling was reported by state television on tuesday .
a spokesman for the guardian council , abbas ali kadkhodaei , was quoted by the english-language press tv as saying the council had found " no major fraud or breach in the election " .
the ruling came after a rally on monday had taken place despite warnings against such gatherings by the revolutionary guards .
a spokesman for mr ban said he had been following the situation in iran with " growing concern " and was dismayed by the post-election violence , particularly the use of force against civilians .
a statement said : " he calls on the authorities to respect fundamental civil and political rights , especially the freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom of information . "
there are lots of people but they are scattered eyewitness , in e-mail to bbc persian tv how iran eavesdrops on mobiles jeremy bowen : splits widen he called on iran 's government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully through dialogue and legal means .
" he urges an immediate stop to the arrests , threats and use of force .
the secretary general reiterates his hope that the democratic will of the people of iran will be fully respected , " the statement read .
some 1,000 people gathered in haft-e tir square despite the warning from iran 's revolutionary guards against holding unapproved rallies .
basij militiamen wielding clubs were brought in to reinforce the police .
the guards , an elite armed force , vowed to crack down on new street protests over the presidential election results .
on friday , ayatollah ali khamenei banned protests , prompting street violence in which at least 10 people died .
severe reporting restrictions placed on the bbc and other foreign media in iran mean protest reports can not be verified independently .
clubs and tear gas eyewitnesses said hundreds of riot police were used to drive the protesters from the square on monday .
bbc persian tv received an e-mail from one person saying : " there are lots of people but they are scattered , and lots of police guards .
they are firing bullets in the air and using tear gas against the crowds . "
the revolutionary guards have close ties to the country 's supreme leader .

video has emerged of iranian police making arrests on saturday in a statement posted on their website , they said their troops would break up street protests and force protesters from the streets .
" be prepared for a resolution and revolutionary confrontation with the guards , basij and other security forces and disciplinary forces , " they said .
" the guards will firmly confront in a revolutionary way rioters and those who violate the law . "
the basij militia was involved in quelling earlier protests during more than a week of demonstrations against the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
' no memorial service ' meanwhile , the fiance of neda agha-soltan , the young woman whose violent death during clashes in tehran on saturday was recorded on video and uploaded to the internet , has described the events leading up to her shooting in an interview for bbc persian tv .
she had been sitting with her music teacher in a car , stuck in traffic , when she decided to get out because of the heat .
the authorities are aware that everybody in iran and throughout the whole world knows about her story caspian makan fiance of neda agha-soltan militia targeted ' death video woman ' " she got out of the car for just for a few minutes -lsb- and -rsb- that 's when she was shot dead , " said caspian makan .
mr makan quoted eyewitnesses as saying she appeared to have been targeted deliberately by " paramilitaries in civilian clothing " .
he added that officials had prevented mourners holding a memorial service at a mosque on monday .
" the authorities are aware that everybody in iran and throughout the whole world knows about her story , " he told the bbc .
" they were afraid that lots of people could turn up . "
election results show mr ahmadinejad won the 12 june election by a landslide , taking 63 % of the vote , almost double that of mir hossein mousavi , his nearest rival .
the guardian council , which oversees the electoral process , said it had found some evidence of voting irregularities but the number had " no effect on the result of the elections " .
an independent british analysis of the disputed election results has found irregularities in the reported turnout , as well as " implausible " swings in the vote in favour of mr ahmadinejad .
analysts from st andrew 's university and the chatham house think-tank said votes in favour of mr ahmadinejad in a third of the provinces would have required an " unlikely scenario " of voting patterns .

he urged them to respect fundamental civil rights , " especially the freedom of assembly and expression " .
his comments came as there were further clashes in the capital tehran .
iran 's legislative body , the guardian council , said there were no major polling irregularities in the 12 june election and ruled out an annulment .
the ruling was reported by state television on tuesday .
a spokesman for the guardian council , abbas ali kadkhodaei , was quoted by the english-language press tv as saying the council had found " no major fraud or breach in the election " .
the ruling came after a rally on monday had taken place despite warnings against such gatherings by the revolutionary guards .
a spokesman for mr ban said he had been following the situation in iran with " growing concern " and was dismayed by the post-election violence , particularly the use of force against civilians .
a statement said : " he calls on the authorities to respect fundamental civil and political rights , especially the freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom of information . "
" there are lots of people but they are scattered " eyewitness , in e-mail to bbc persian tv how iran eavesdrops on mobiles jeremy bowen : splits widen he called on iran 's government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully through dialogue and legal means .
" he urges an immediate stop to the arrests , threats and use of force .
the secretary general reiterates his hope that the democratic will of the people of iran will be fully respected , " the statement read .
some 1,000 people gathered in haft-e tir square despite the warning from iran 's revolutionary guards against holding unapproved rallies .
basij militiamen wielding clubs were brought in to reinforce the police .
the guards , an elite armed force , vowed to crack down on new street protests over the presidential election results .
on friday , ayatollah ali khamenei banned protests , prompting street violence in which at least 10 people died .
severe reporting restrictions placed on the bbc and other foreign media in iran mean protest reports can not be verified independently .
clubs and tear gas eyewitnesses said hundreds of riot police were used to drive the protesters from the square on monday .
bbc persian tv received an e-mail from one person saying : " there are lots of people but they are scattered , and lots of police guards .
they are firing bullets in the air and using tear gas against the crowds . "
the revolutionary guards have close ties to the country 's supreme leader .
in a statement posted on their website , they said their troops would break up street protests and force protesters from the streets .
" be prepared for a resolution and revolutionary confrontation with the guards , basij and other security forces and disciplinary forces , " they said .
" the guards will firmly confront in a revolutionary way rioters and those who violate the law . "
the basij militia was involved in quelling earlier protests during more than a week of demonstrations against the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
' no memorial service ' meanwhile , the fiance of neda agha-soltan , the young woman whose violent death during clashes in tehran on saturday was recorded on video and uploaded to the internet , has described the events leading up to her shooting in an interview for bbc persian tv .
she had been sitting with her music teacher in a car , stuck in traffic , when she decided to get out because of the heat . "
the authorities are aware that everybody in iran and throughout the whole world knows about her story " caspian makan fiance of neda agha-soltan militia targeted ' death video woman ' " she got out of the car for just for a few minutes -lsb- and -rsb- that 's when she was shot dead , " said caspian makan .
mr makan quoted eyewitnesses as saying she appeared to have been targeted deliberately by " paramilitaries in civilian clothing " .
he added that officials had prevented mourners holding a memorial service at a mosque on monday .
" the authorities are aware that everybody in iran and throughout the whole world knows about her story , " he told the bbc .
" they were afraid that lots of people could turn up . "
election results show mr ahmadinejad won the 12 june election by a landslide , taking 63 % of the vote , almost double that of mir hossein mousavi , his nearest rival .
the guardian council , which oversees the electoral process , said it had found some evidence of voting irregularities but the number had " no effect on the result of the elections " .
an independent british analysis of the disputed election results has found irregularities in the reported turnout , as well as " implausible " swings in the vote in favour of mr ahmadinejad .
analysts from st andrew 's university and the chatham house think-tank said votes in favour of mr ahmadinejad in a third of the provinces would have required an " unlikely scenario " of voting patterns .
