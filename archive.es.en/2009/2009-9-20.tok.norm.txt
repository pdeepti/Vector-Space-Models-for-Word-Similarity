this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

although the berliners had more ball possession in the first half , freiburg controlled the game and the shock for hertha was complete after freiburg 's striker mohamadou idrissou scored in the 42nd .
however , the ordeal was not over for hertha .
although the berliners started more aggressively into the second half , it was freiburg 's banovic who scored his second goal in the 68th , sealing his team 's impressive 4-0 victory against an uninspired hertha . " we ca n't carry on like this .
we are no longer prepared to fight and defend properly and instead think we can simply play forward .
that 's not enough .
it will be very tough to get out of this , " said the visibly shocked hertha coach lucien favre after the match .
defensive frankfurt hold hamburg to 1-1 draw hamburg took an early lead after frankfurt 's goalkeeper oka nikolov failed to clear a free kick , leaving brazilian midfielder ze roberto to net a headball at short distance in the 8th minute .
but , though hamburg looked like the better team for most of the match , it was frankfurt 's defender marco russ who equalized in the 32nd after a perfect assist by alexander meier . frankfurt 's coach michael skibbe had pledged that his team would play as aggressively as possible , but hamburg had more of the ball , with the hessians reacting rather passively for the remainder of the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's ze roberto celebrates his opening goal " hamburg was a lot closer to winning than we were , " skibbe admitted after the match .
hsv coach bruno labbadia was not satisfied with the result " we are disappointed .
we gave two points away today .
we stopped playing football after taking the early lead . "
the draw means that both teams remain unbeaten in the bundesliga .
hamburg , leverkusen remain table leaders a well organized leverkusen clashed with a weakened bremen , who had to do without injured star midfielder mesut özil .
some phases of the game saw fast play on both sides , with hosts leverkusen having the edge on bremen .
however , werder coach thomas schaaf was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" both teams had a lot of respect for each other and there was little room to maneuver .
nobody wanted to open up and so there were few opportunities to score . "
leverkusen 's star striker stefan kiessling was content despite the fact that his series of scoring in every match since the beginning of the season was interrupted against bremen .
" we can be satisfied with this result .
nobody has managed to beat us yet . "
kiessling 's failure to score in his sixth consecutive match not only lost him a new bundesliga record it will also lose him his beard which he had planned on growing as long as his series lasted .
the goalless draw also means that hamburg remain on par with leverkusen with 14 points at the top of the table ; the hsv , however , takes first position on goal difference. nk / dpa / reuters / sid editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.09.2009 germany 's free democrats pledge loyalty to a center-right coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman westerwelle says he will only team up with merkel 's conservatives ahead of next week 's general election , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- declared the christian democrats as their preferred coalition partner , ruling out a three-way coalition with the social democrats and the greens . the leader of the opposition free democrats , guido westerwelle , says his party intends to form a governing coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .
" the polls are very encouraging and will motivate us to keep fighting even harder in the campaign , " she said. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.09.2009 germany 's free democrats pledge loyalty to a center-right coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman westerwelle says he will only team up with merkel 's conservatives ahead of next week 's general election , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- declared the christian democrats as their preferred coalition partner , ruling out a three-way coalition with the social democrats and the greens . the leader of the opposition free democrats , guido westerwelle , says his party intends to form a governing coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .
" the polls are very encouraging and will motivate us to keep fighting even harder in the campaign , " she said. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .

although the berliners had more ball possession in the first half , freiburg controlled the game and the shock for hertha was complete after freiburg 's striker mohamadou idrissou scored in the 42nd .
however , the ordeal was not over for hertha .
although the berliners started more aggressively into the second half , it was freiburg 's banovic who scored his second goal in the 68th , sealing his team 's impressive 4-0 victory against an uninspired hertha . " we ca n't carry on like this .
we are no longer prepared to fight and defend properly and instead think we can simply play forward .
that 's not enough .
it will be very tough to get out of this , " said the visibly shocked hertha coach lucien favre after the match .
defensive frankfurt hold hamburg to 1-1 draw hamburg took an early lead after frankfurt 's goalkeeper oka nikolov failed to clear a free kick , leaving brazilian midfielder ze roberto to net a headball at short distance in the 8th minute .
but , though hamburg looked like the better team for most of the match , it was frankfurt 's defender marco russ who equalized in the 32nd after a perfect assist by alexander meier . frankfurt 's coach michael skibbe had pledged that his team would play as aggressively as possible , but hamburg had more of the ball , with the hessians reacting rather passively for the remainder of the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's ze roberto celebrates his opening goal " hamburg was a lot closer to winning than we were , " skibbe admitted after the match .
hsv coach bruno labbadia was not satisfied with the result " we are disappointed .
we gave two points away today .
we stopped playing football after taking the early lead . "
the draw means that both teams remain unbeaten in the bundesliga .
hamburg , leverkusen remain table leaders a well organized leverkusen clashed with a weakened bremen , who had to do without injured star midfielder mesut özil .
some phases of the game saw fast play on both sides , with hosts leverkusen having the edge on bremen .
however , werder coach thomas schaaf was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" both teams had a lot of respect for each other and there was little room to maneuver .
nobody wanted to open up and so there were few opportunities to score . "
leverkusen 's star striker stefan kiessling was content despite the fact that his series of scoring in every match since the beginning of the season was interrupted against bremen .
" we can be satisfied with this result .
nobody has managed to beat us yet . "
kiessling 's failure to score in his sixth consecutive match not only lost him a new bundesliga record it will also lose him his beard which he had planned on growing as long as his series lasted .
the goalless draw also means that hamburg remain on par with leverkusen with 14 points at the top of the table ; the hsv , however , takes first position on goal difference. nk / dpa / reuters / sid editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.09.2009 germany 's free democrats pledge loyalty to a center-right coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman westerwelle says he will only team up with merkel 's conservatives ahead of next week 's general election , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- declared the christian democrats as their preferred coalition partner , ruling out a three-way coalition with the social democrats and the greens . the leader of the opposition free democrats , guido westerwelle , says his party intends to form a governing coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .
" the polls are very encouraging and will motivate us to keep fighting even harder in the campaign , " she said. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community .

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .
gay pride organizers are calling on the government to launch an investigation to identify those responsible for making threats against the march. vj / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .
" the polls are very encouraging and will motivate us to keep fighting even harder in the campaign , " she said. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .
gay pride organizers are calling on the government to launch an investigation to identify those responsible for making threats against the march. vj / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are no longer prepared to fight and defend properly and instead think we can simply play forward .
that 's not enough .
it will be very tough to get out of this , " said the visibly shocked hertha coach lucien favre after the match .
defensive frankfurt hold hamburg to 1-1 draw hamburg took an early lead after frankfurt 's goalkeeper oka nikolov failed to clear a free kick , leaving brazilian midfielder ze roberto to net a headball at short distance in the 8th minute .
but , though hamburg looked like the better team for most of the match , it was frankfurt 's defender marco russ who equalized in the 32nd after a perfect assist by alexander meier . frankfurt 's coach michael skibbe had pledged that his team would play as aggressively as possible , but hamburg had more of the ball , with the hessians reacting rather passively for the remainder of the game .

" both teams had a lot of respect for each other and there was little room to maneuver .

" we can be satisfied with this result .
nobody has managed to beat us yet . "
kiessling 's failure to score in his sixth consecutive match not only lost him a new bundesliga record it will also lose him his beard which he had planned on growing as long as his series lasted .

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .

" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .

steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .

support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .

nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.09.2009 germany 's free democrats pledge loyalty to a center-right coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman westerwelle says he will only team up with merkel 's conservatives ahead of next week 's general election , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- declared the christian democrats as their preferred coalition partner , ruling out a three-way coalition with the social democrats and the greens . the leader of the opposition free democrats , guido westerwelle , says his party intends to form a governing coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .

by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .

fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .
gay pride organizers are calling on the government to launch an investigation to identify those responsible for making threats against the march. vj / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .
" the polls are very encouraging and will motivate us to keep fighting even harder in the campaign , " she said. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .
" the election provides a specific focus for the propaganda and operational activities of terrorist groups . " rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the berliners had more ball possession in the first half , freiburg controlled the game and the shock for hertha was complete after freiburg 's striker mohamadou idrissou scored in the 42nd .
however , the ordeal was not over for hertha .
although the berliners started more aggressively into the second half , it was freiburg 's banovic who scored his second goal in the 68th , sealing his team 's impressive 4-0 victory against an uninspired hertha . " we ca n't carry on like this .
we are no longer prepared to fight and defend properly and instead think we can simply play forward .
that 's not enough .
it will be very tough to get out of this , " said the visibly shocked hertha coach lucien favre after the match .
defensive frankfurt hold hamburg to 1-1 draw hamburg took an early lead after frankfurt 's goalkeeper oka nikolov failed to clear a free kick , leaving brazilian midfielder ze roberto to net a headball at short distance in the 8th minute .
but , though hamburg looked like the better team for most of the match , it was frankfurt 's defender marco russ who equalized in the 32nd after a perfect assist by alexander meier . frankfurt 's coach michael skibbe had pledged that his team would play as aggressively as possible , but hamburg had more of the ball , with the hessians reacting rather passively for the remainder of the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's ze roberto celebrates his opening goal " hamburg was a lot closer to winning than we were , " skibbe admitted after the match .
hsv coach bruno labbadia was not satisfied with the result " we are disappointed .

hamburg , leverkusen remain table leaders a well organized leverkusen clashed with a weakened bremen , who had to do without injured star midfielder mesut özil .
some phases of the game saw fast play on both sides , with hosts leverkusen having the edge on bremen .
however , werder coach thomas schaaf was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" both teams had a lot of respect for each other and there was little room to maneuver .
nobody wanted to open up and so there were few opportunities to score . "
leverkusen 's star striker stefan kiessling was content despite the fact that his series of scoring in every match since the beginning of the season was interrupted against bremen .
" we can be satisfied with this result .
nobody has managed to beat us yet . "
kiessling 's failure to score in his sixth consecutive match not only lost him a new bundesliga record it will also lose him his beard which he had planned on growing as long as his series lasted .

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .
" the polls are very encouraging and will motivate us to keep fighting even harder in the campaign , " she said. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .
gay pride organizers are calling on the government to launch an investigation to identify those responsible for making threats against the march. vj / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .

however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .

fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community .

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .

fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .

although the berliners had more ball possession in the first half , freiburg controlled the game and the shock for hertha was complete after freiburg 's striker mohamadou idrissou scored in the 42nd .
however , the ordeal was not over for hertha .
although the berliners started more aggressively into the second half , it was freiburg 's banovic who scored his second goal in the 68th , sealing his team 's impressive 4-0 victory against an uninspired hertha . " we ca n't carry on like this .
we are no longer prepared to fight and defend properly and instead think we can simply play forward .
that 's not enough .
it will be very tough to get out of this , " said the visibly shocked hertha coach lucien favre after the match .
defensive frankfurt hold hamburg to 1-1 draw hamburg took an early lead after frankfurt 's goalkeeper oka nikolov failed to clear a free kick , leaving brazilian midfielder ze roberto to net a headball at short distance in the 8th minute .
but , though hamburg looked like the better team for most of the match , it was frankfurt 's defender marco russ who equalized in the 32nd after a perfect assist by alexander meier . frankfurt 's coach michael skibbe had pledged that his team would play as aggressively as possible , but hamburg had more of the ball , with the hessians reacting rather passively for the remainder of the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's ze roberto celebrates his opening goal " hamburg was a lot closer to winning than we were , " skibbe admitted after the match .
hsv coach bruno labbadia was not satisfied with the result " we are disappointed .
we gave two points away today .
we stopped playing football after taking the early lead . "
the draw means that both teams remain unbeaten in the bundesliga .
hamburg , leverkusen remain table leaders a well organized leverkusen clashed with a weakened bremen , who had to do without injured star midfielder mesut özil .
some phases of the game saw fast play on both sides , with hosts leverkusen having the edge on bremen .
however , werder coach thomas schaaf was satisfied with his team 's performance .
" both teams had a lot of respect for each other and there was little room to maneuver .
nobody wanted to open up and so there were few opportunities to score . "
leverkusen 's star striker stefan kiessling was content despite the fact that his series of scoring in every match since the beginning of the season was interrupted against bremen .
" we can be satisfied with this result .
nobody has managed to beat us yet . "
kiessling 's failure to score in his sixth consecutive match not only lost him a new bundesliga record it will also lose him his beard which he had planned on growing as long as his series lasted .
the goalless draw also means that hamburg remain on par with leverkusen with 14 points at the top of the table ; the hsv , however , takes first position on goal difference. nk / dpa / reuters / sid editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although the berliners had more ball possession in the first half , freiburg controlled the game and the shock for hertha was complete after freiburg 's striker mohamadou idrissou scored in the 42nd .
however , the ordeal was not over for hertha .
although the berliners started more aggressively into the second half , it was freiburg 's banovic who scored his second goal in the 68th , sealing his team 's impressive 4-0 victory against an uninspired hertha . " we ca n't carry on like this .
we are no longer prepared to fight and defend properly and instead think we can simply play forward .
that 's not enough .
it will be very tough to get out of this , " said the visibly shocked hertha coach lucien favre after the match .
defensive frankfurt hold hamburg to 1-1 draw hamburg took an early lead after frankfurt 's goalkeeper oka nikolov failed to clear a free kick , leaving brazilian midfielder ze roberto to net a headball at short distance in the 8th minute .
but , though hamburg looked like the better team for most of the match , it was frankfurt 's defender marco russ who equalized in the 32nd after a perfect assist by alexander meier . frankfurt 's coach michael skibbe had pledged that his team would play as aggressively as possible , but hamburg had more of the ball , with the hessians reacting rather passively for the remainder of the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's ze roberto celebrates his opening goal " hamburg was a lot closer to winning than we were , " skibbe admitted after the match .

" both teams had a lot of respect for each other and there was little room to maneuver .
nobody wanted to open up and so there were few opportunities to score . "
leverkusen 's star striker stefan kiessling was content despite the fact that his series of scoring in every match since the beginning of the season was interrupted against bremen .
" we can be satisfied with this result .
nobody has managed to beat us yet . "
kiessling 's failure to score in his sixth consecutive match not only lost him a new bundesliga record it will also lose him his beard which he had planned on growing as long as his series lasted .

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .
" the election provides a specific focus for the propaganda and operational activities of terrorist groups . " rb / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .

fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community .

president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

for germany 's four million muslims , the past weeks have shown that living by the rules of their religion here is getting easier . on a sunny afternoon , vendors crowd the narrow passageway between overflowing fruit and vegetable stands and shelves stacked with an array of fabrics and spices .
berliners call the market the " turkish market " , as many vendors here are turkish , and groups of women donning headscarves and long robes saunter among the crowds .
germany 's muslims – along with those around the world - now have four weeks behind them of not being allowed to eat , smoke or have sex .
however , this weekend , the fasting month comes to a close .
followers will celebrate with a grand festival known as eid ul-fitr - and many at the market are doing some last-minute preparations .
fasting as the minority nura usta , who works at one of the stalls , is originally from samsun on the turkish black sea coast .
she thinks of her homeland often , and especially at this time of year .
" i 'm going to visit my family next year .
spending the fasting month with family is simply the best , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuran usta hopes to join her family for ramadan in turkey next year but even for muslims whose family is with them in germany , adhering to the rules of the month of ramadan can be challenging in a country where the majority do not participate .
fasting is taken very seriously in islam as it is one of the religion 's five pillars .
in islamic countries , life practically turns upside down , as the entire population adapts to the fast .
there are special foods , special festivals , events and tv programs .
" it is better , of course , when one can fast in turkey or egypt , " said burhan kesici , secretary general of the islamic council , one of the largest muslim associations in berlin , " but in germany one can also fast well . "
today , sitting in his office , kesici is somewhat stressed .
first , his office is being remodeled , and then , of course , he has n't eaten anything all day , and he must quickly finish-off all of the festival greeting cards from his organization .
" ramadan is really supposed to be a time to pause and reflect , " said kesici with a shrug of his shoulders .
but as the festival this weekend is one of the most important in islam , he must be prepared .
a new german ramadan culture for kesici , the past weeks have confirmed his impression that fasting is accepted by the non-muslim majority .
" it has developed into its own german ramadan culture , " said kesici as he tells of the many gatherings with friends and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burhan kesici sees a german-ramadan culture emerging it 's not hard to imagine that one day ramadan will be included on the german calendar , as several religious leaders and politicians have reached out to the muslim community . " may god accept your fasting and praying and give all believers inner and outer peace , " archbishop robert zollitsch wrote as head of the german-catholic bishop 's conference .
president horst koehler wished " all who celebrate eid ul-fitr , happiness , health , and luck . "
kesici is pleased by the acknowledgements .
" this demonstrates to us muslims that we have been accepted in germany . "

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .
gay pride organizers are calling on the government to launch an investigation to identify those responsible for making threats against the march. vj / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .

surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .
the only other politically viable option is thought to be a return of the grand coalition , which has been in power since 2005 .
merkel told journalists on friday that she was confident her conservatives and the free democrats would eke out a victory .

the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .

" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .

he added that the police would not be able to guarantee their safety . serbian president boris tadic had on friday promised to protect the activists at the planned gay pride parade .
the last gay pride event in belgrade – held nearly a decade ago – ended in a violent battle , and this year , nationalist and right-wing groups threatened a repeat attack .
however , organizer dragana vuckovic rejected the suggested venue change , telling the afp , " that would be unacceptable for us . "
" the message of equal rights is transmitted symbolically when a group on the margins is able to parade in the center of the capital , " said vuckovic .
nationalists welcomed the cancellation of the event , calling it a defeat for " infidels and satanists " .
the parade was expected to attract up to 1,000 people , including a number of public figures , foreign diplomats , and activists from neighboring countries .
some analysts say the event could have been an opportunity for serbia to present itself to the world as a tolerant and open society , as it prepares its bid for eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.09.2009 germany 's free democrats pledge loyalty to a center-right coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman westerwelle says he will only team up with merkel 's conservatives ahead of next week 's general election , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- declared the christian democrats as their preferred coalition partner , ruling out a three-way coalition with the social democrats and the greens . the leader of the opposition free democrats , guido westerwelle , says his party intends to form a governing coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
the announcement is intended to end speculation that the free democrats might join forces with other political parties after the september 27 election .
merkel appealed to the fdp to make an official announcement this weekend in favor of a coalition with her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but in the same breath praised the achievements of her four-year-old " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
westerwelle 's announcement means a three-way coalition with the spd and the greens is no longer an option for his party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has little chance of beating merkel without fdp support " because the election manifestos of the spd and greens call for more taxation of private individuals and businesses , the fdp will not help those parties form a parliamentary majority , " he said .
" we want to see an end to the grand coalition , " westerwelle added .
" we want to make sure there is no chance for a left-wing government and have made an unequivocal decision to form a coalition with the conservatives . "
steinmeier warns against center-right coalition social democrat candidate foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reacted defiantly to the fdp 's rejection of a possible three-way coalition after the election .
the spd chairman advised the party to wait until after next weekend 's election to decide on a coalition partner .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , steinmeier said that voters did n't want an alliance that reflected " social coldness " .
" the kind of thinking that led us into this crisis can not provide the way out of the crisis .
that 's why the fdp and the conservatives can not be allowed to win . "
" i 'm campaigning for a strong spd that steers the next government on a social course . "
steinmeier ruled out a coalition with the far-left left party for the whole legislative period until 2013 .
however , he renewed his call for a three-way coalition with the green party and the fdp . political analysts , however , say another grand coalition with the cdu is the spd 's only chance of returning to government .
surveys continue to see merkel in the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has made clarion call for a center-right coalition this week , three voter surveys showed merkel 's conservatives dipping slightly at 35-36 percent support , while the spd picked up between one and three points over last week to reach 25-26 percent .
support for the spd has risen after a relatively strong performance by steinmeier in a head-to-head television debate with merkel last sunday .
the fdp currently have 13-14 percent , which would give merkel a razor-thin majority to form her desired coalition .

this has raised new concerns that al-qaeda-linked terrorists may be trying to scare german voters before next weekend 's polls . thirty-two-year-old bekkay harrach reportedly appears once again in an internet video to warn germans of a possible terror attack .
germany 's bka federal police confirmed in berlin on sunday that a new message had appeared , but added only that it contained no specific threat .
a bka spokeswoman said the content still had to be analyzed .
police said an audio message was posted under the title " o allah !
i love you " .
harrach , a german of moroccan parentage , is said to appear veiled in a series of photographs .
according to the bka , which has confirmed the authenticity of the tape , harrach speaks in german and his message is addressed to germany but does not constitute a specific threat .
security stepped up the latest video warning came even as federal police officers wearing bullet-proof vests and toting sub-machine-guns fanned out to patrol airports , major railway stations and the key streets in the capital berlin .
the boost in security came after the first terror video was posted on the internet on friday .
bildunterschrift : in the first video posted on friday harrach warned germans not to vote for any of the parties endorsing the afghanistan mission in that first video , harrach had said that germany would face a " rude awakening " if it did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan .
by all accounts , the german government is taking such video threats very seriously , especially given that they come in the wake of growing signs that the al-qaeda network may be preparing for an attack on german targets .
the interior ministry confirmed that they have adapted the security levels to the new situation . " since the start of the year , threats against germany from al-qaeda and other islamist organizations have increased to a whole new level , " the ministry says on its website .
