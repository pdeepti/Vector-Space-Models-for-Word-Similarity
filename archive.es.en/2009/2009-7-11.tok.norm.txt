obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .

before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "

you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess smith sits with her family , wearing traditional dress bearing the images of president barack obama and ghana 's president john atta mills after delivering the keynote speech , the president , who is travelling with his family , paid an emotional visit to a former slave trading fortress .
the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

but ghana has travelled a long and often difficult path to reach this status . it could have been one of those african countries that fulfills all the negative stereotypes .
in 1957 , ghana became the first african nation to win independence from britain , and for a long time , it seemed as if this state on the gulf of guinea was headed in the wrong direction .
president kwame nkrumah 's botched attempt to introduce socialism to modern ghana resulted in a massive financial crisis , high national debt and corruption .
in the years that followed , a series of military coups ended with the ascension to power of flight lieutenant jerry rawlings in 1981 .
his reign of terror and repression lasted for 11 years , although he did manage to advance ghana 's economy .
the imf and the world bank began to praise ghana 's economic and political stability in ever-louder tones .
rawlings had managed an about-face , and in 1992 , he emerged as the victor from elections that were more or less free and fair .
clinton visit marks turn-around in 1998 , former us president bill clinton became the first us leader to visit ghana , and he showered rawlings with accolades .
clinton described ghana 's development as part of a new african renaissance , not least because something very unusual happens in ghana : state rulers voluntarily step down or end their terms in office in an orderly fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's elections serve as an example to other african countries that was the case with rawlings , and then with john kuffuor .
and if ghana remains true to its reputation , it will also be the case with john atta-mills of the national democratic congress .
he took office this year after a run-off against the new patriotic party , marking the second time that power had been transferred from one legitimately elected leader to another .
ghana 's economy is continuing a pattern of strong growth , despite the fact that the national debt has climbed dramatically in recent years .
the financial crisis has been tough on the world 's second-biggest cocoa producer .
but the discovery of oil reserves off the coast is reviving the country 's colonial-era name : gold coast .
ghana , however , is determined not to follow the inglorious example of nigeria , where corruption means poverty is rampant despite the country 's vast oil wealth .
in contrast , ghana aims to also set an example in the sustainable management of its oil reserves .

"
but he added that tehran would " act on it accordingly " if that were to change .
the declaration from from g-8 said there was " serious concern " among the world 's most powerful countries at the way the iranian republic cracked down on opposition followers protesting the outcome of june elections .
leaders also called for a negotiated resolution of the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , naming the g-20 summit in september as the deadline .
patience wo n't last forever us president barack obama said that although the g-8 were willing to provide tehran with the time to find a solution , there was a limit to their patience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama says he is offering tehran a door to better relations " we also say we 're not going to just wait indefinitely and allow for the development of the nuclear weapon , the breach of international treaties and wake up one day and find ourselves in a much worse situation and unable to act . "
tehran has repeatedly rejected claims that it has plans to make atomic weapons , insisting instead that its nuclear program is purely in pursuit of energy .
taking a clear stance but obama said he hoped the leadership in iran would look at the statement and realize that world opinion was clear .
" the international community has said : ' here 's a door , you can walk through .
that allows you to lessen tensions and more fully join the international community ' . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goals of iran 's nuclear program are suspect to many in the west on saturday , foreign minister mottaki said that iran was preparing a new package of issues to put to the west .
" the package can be a good basis for talks with the west , " he told reporters at a news conference , adding that it would contain " iran 's stances on political , security and international issues . " the p5-plus-1 group , comprising the five permanent members of the united nations security council , plus germany , has given eu foreign policy chief javier solana the go-ahead to hold talks with iran over its nuclear program. tkw / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 11.07.2009 from problem child to poster child : ghana 's journey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's visit to ghana is further polishing the country 's image as barack obama visits ghana , he honors a country that is now held up as an african model of good governance .
but ghana has travelled a long and often difficult path to reach this status . it could have been one of those african countries that fulfills all the negative stereotypes .
in 1957 , ghana became the first african nation to win independence from britain , and for a long time , it seemed as if this state on the gulf of guinea was headed in the wrong direction .
president kwame nkrumah 's botched attempt to introduce socialism to modern ghana resulted in a massive financial crisis , high national debt and corruption .
in the years that followed , a series of military coups ended with the ascension to power of flight lieutenant jerry rawlings in 1981 .
his reign of terror and repression lasted for 11 years , although he did manage to advance ghana 's economy .
the imf and the world bank began to praise ghana 's economic and political stability in ever-louder tones .
rawlings had managed an about-face , and in 1992 , he emerged as the victor from elections that were more or less free and fair .
clinton visit marks turn-around in 1998 , former us president bill clinton became the first us leader to visit ghana , and he showered rawlings with accolades .
clinton described ghana 's development as part of a new african renaissance , not least because something very unusual happens in ghana : state rulers voluntarily step down or end their terms in office in an orderly fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's elections serve as an example to other african countries that was the case with rawlings , and then with john kuffuor .
and if ghana remains true to its reputation , it will also be the case with john atta-mills of the national democratic congress .
he took office this year after a run-off against the new patriotic party , marking the second time that power had been transferred from one legitimately elected leader to another .
ghana 's economy is continuing a pattern of strong growth , despite the fact that the national debt has climbed dramatically in recent years .
the financial crisis has been tough on the world 's second-biggest cocoa producer .
but the discovery of oil reserves off the coast is reviving the country 's colonial-era name : gold coast .
ghana , however , is determined not to follow the inglorious example of nigeria , where corruption means poverty is rampant despite the country 's vast oil wealth .
in contrast , ghana aims to also set an example in the sustainable management of its oil reserves .

on saturday in dresden , several hundred people gathered to honor 31-year-old marwa al sherbini , a pharmacist fatally stabbed by a russian-born immigrant . the public memorial in dresden , organized by local civil rights groups , attracted some 800 people , including the egyptian ambassador and officials from the state of saxony , where dresden is located . veil murder dubbed the " veil murder " by muslim groups , al sherbini , who was three months pregnant , was stabbed at least 18 times in front of her husband and their three-year-old son by a russian-born german man in the courtroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding photo of egyptian marwa al sherbini , stabbed to death in a dresden courtroom she had previously successfully sued the man for damages after he was found guilty of insulting her for wearing a headscarf in a children 's playground . the 28-year-old man , identified only as alex w. , had appealed against the conviction and fine , and the fatal attack took place during the appeal hearing .
the man had right-wing views , according to police , but no previous record of offenses . marwa al sherbini 's husband is still in a critical condition in hospital after also being stabbed by the assailant and shot in the leg by police who mistakenly took him for the attacker . demonstrations since the murder small protests have taken place in cairo and within the german domestic population .
further demonstrations are planned for sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people carry the coffin of marwa al sherbini in alexandria , egypt on july 6 what has surprised and angered muslims in germany and elsewhere is the slow response made by the german government to the incident and the apparent indifference of the german press . the berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel asked on thursday : " why was the death of a veiled woman , who was not the victim of an ' honor crime ' , only news in brief for a whole week ? " the german press buried the report of the murder on the back pages and have since focused on the issue of security in german courts rather than the racist aspect of the killing . german government takes one week to issue response the incident occurred on july 1 but the german government took until july 8 to issue a statement of condolence . this was followed up by a letter written by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and sent to his egyptian counterpart ahmed abul gheit expressing his condolences to the woman 's family . chancellor angela merkel expressed germany 's condolences to egyptian president hosny mubarak on the fringes of the g8 summit in italy on thursday .

the social democrats have called for a faster nuclear phase-out plan - currently planned for 2020 - and stressed the importance of closing eight of the oldest reactors without further ado .
for their part , the christian democrats have reiterated calls to extend the operating lives of the nation 's plants on the grounds that the technology is perfectly safe .
but a survey conducted by the research institute , emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper , has revealed many reservations towards nuclear energy among normal germans .
some 72 percent of the 501 people asked said they would like to see kruemmel and other older reactors closed down .
looking ahead to elections sweden 's vattenfall , which operates the plant in northern germany , has said the short-circuit last saturday was an isolated incident which should not be blown out of proportion or used to bolster an anti-nuclear election campaign .
" to use the incident as an instrument is wrong , " said european head of vattenfall , tuomo hatakka , in the news journal focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear opponents want cleaner fuel sources he said the safety of the reactor had never been compromised and that to suggest otherwise was " irresponsible " towards the public .
german conservative politicians have also accused the opposition of trying to use the incident to win over voters ahead of september elections .
state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , told daily die welt that spd environment minister sigmar gabriel was trying " to show the spd leadership how to turn an issue into a campaign platform , " by playing with people 's fears .
vattenfall has invited people who live near the kruemmel plant to attend an information and discussion session on saturday in a bid to keep them abreast of what is going on on their doorsteps. tkw / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "

the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .

before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "

obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess smith sits with her family , wearing traditional dress bearing the images of president barack obama and ghana 's president john atta mills after delivering the keynote speech , the president , who is travelling with his family , paid an emotional visit to a former slave trading fortress .
the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the social democrats have called for a faster nuclear phase-out plan - currently planned for 2020 - and stressed the importance of closing eight of the oldest reactors without further ado .
for their part , the christian democrats have reiterated calls to extend the operating lives of the nation 's plants on the grounds that the technology is perfectly safe .

"
but he added that tehran would " act on it accordingly " if that were to change .
the declaration from from g-8 said there was " serious concern " among the world 's most powerful countries at the way the iranian republic cracked down on opposition followers protesting the outcome of june elections .
leaders also called for a negotiated resolution of the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , naming the g-20 summit in september as the deadline .
patience wo n't last forever us president barack obama said that although the g-8 were willing to provide tehran with the time to find a solution , there was a limit to their patience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama says he is offering tehran a door to better relations " we also say we 're not going to just wait indefinitely and allow for the development of the nuclear weapon , the breach of international treaties and wake up one day and find ourselves in a much worse situation and unable to act . "
tehran has repeatedly rejected claims that it has plans to make atomic weapons , insisting instead that its nuclear program is purely in pursuit of energy .
taking a clear stance but obama said he hoped the leadership in iran would look at the statement and realize that world opinion was clear .
" the international community has said : ' here 's a door , you can walk through .
that allows you to lessen tensions and more fully join the international community ' . "

muslims accuse the german government of playing down the matter . around 150 students in tehran threw eggs and demonstrated outside the german embassy building in the iranian capital on saturday shouting " death to germany ! and " down with racist europeans ! "
the protests were in response to the murder of a pregnant egyptian woman in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden on july 1 and the perceived low-profile response of the german government .
on saturday in dresden , several hundred people gathered to honor 31-year-old marwa al sherbini , a pharmacist fatally stabbed by a russian-born immigrant . the public memorial in dresden , organized by local civil rights groups , attracted some 800 people , including the egyptian ambassador and officials from the state of saxony , where dresden is located . veil murder dubbed the " veil murder " by muslim groups , al sherbini , who was three months pregnant , was stabbed at least 18 times in front of her husband and their three-year-old son by a russian-born german man in the courtroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding photo of egyptian marwa al sherbini , stabbed to death in a dresden courtroom she had previously successfully sued the man for damages after he was found guilty of insulting her for wearing a headscarf in a children 's playground . the 28-year-old man , identified only as alex w. , had appealed against the conviction and fine , and the fatal attack took place during the appeal hearing .

" the german press buried the report of the murder on the back pages and have since focused on the issue of security in german courts rather than the racist aspect of the killing . german government takes one week to issue response the incident occurred on july 1 but the german government took until july 8 to issue a statement of condolence . this was followed up by a letter written by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and sent to his egyptian counterpart ahmed abul gheit expressing his condolences to the woman 's family . chancellor angela merkel expressed germany 's condolences to egyptian president hosny mubarak on the fringes of the g8 summit in italy on thursday .

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ?

no .

the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .

i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .

he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .

" the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess smith sits with her family , wearing traditional dress bearing the images of president barack obama and ghana 's president john atta mills after delivering the keynote speech , the president , who is travelling with his family , paid an emotional visit to a former slave trading fortress .
the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .

obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .

" the german press buried the report of the murder on the back pages and have since focused on the issue of security in german courts rather than the racist aspect of the killing . german government takes one week to issue response the incident occurred on july 1 but the german government took until july 8 to issue a statement of condolence . this was followed up by a letter written by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and sent to his egyptian counterpart ahmed abul gheit expressing his condolences to the woman 's family . chancellor angela merkel expressed germany 's condolences to egyptian president hosny mubarak on the fringes of the g8 summit in italy on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .

adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .

force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .

the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .

the offer comes as a relief to porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking who has been locked in a power struggle with the head of vw , ferdinand piech .
the deal would enable porsche to get out from under a debt of nine billion euros that it accrued while attempting to take over volkswagen in 2008 .
the global economic downturn derailed porsche 's efforts .
porsche currently has a 51 percent share of volkswagen .
vw had made a counter offer of three to four billion euros in june , but that offer was rejected by porsche .
according to reports , vw recently upped its offer to considerably more than four billion euros .
porsche has confirmed that it will hold an extraordinary meeting of its supervisory board on july 23 where it will decide whether to accept the offer from qia .
if successful qia would also get access to shares that would enable it to control about 20 percent of volkswagen at a very attractive price .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , controls just over 20 percent of the company. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .
we shall have to wait to determine if a real revolution is underway . - david berridged , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .

chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .

but ghana has travelled a long and often difficult path to reach this status . it could have been one of those african countries that fulfills all the negative stereotypes .
in 1957 , ghana became the first african nation to win independence from britain , and for a long time , it seemed as if this state on the gulf of guinea was headed in the wrong direction .
president kwame nkrumah 's botched attempt to introduce socialism to modern ghana resulted in a massive financial crisis , high national debt and corruption .
in the years that followed , a series of military coups ended with the ascension to power of flight lieutenant jerry rawlings in 1981 .
his reign of terror and repression lasted for 11 years , although he did manage to advance ghana 's economy .
the imf and the world bank began to praise ghana 's economic and political stability in ever-louder tones .
rawlings had managed an about-face , and in 1992 , he emerged as the victor from elections that were more or less free and fair .
clinton visit marks turn-around in 1998 , former us president bill clinton became the first us leader to visit ghana , and he showered rawlings with accolades .
clinton described ghana 's development as part of a new african renaissance , not least because something very unusual happens in ghana : state rulers voluntarily step down or end their terms in office in an orderly fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's elections serve as an example to other african countries that was the case with rawlings , and then with john kuffuor .
and if ghana remains true to its reputation , it will also be the case with john atta-mills of the national democratic congress .
he took office this year after a run-off against the new patriotic party , marking the second time that power had been transferred from one legitimately elected leader to another .
ghana 's economy is continuing a pattern of strong growth , despite the fact that the national debt has climbed dramatically in recent years .
the financial crisis has been tough on the world 's second-biggest cocoa producer .
but the discovery of oil reserves off the coast is reviving the country 's colonial-era name : gold coast .
ghana , however , is determined not to follow the inglorious example of nigeria , where corruption means poverty is rampant despite the country 's vast oil wealth .
in contrast , ghana aims to also set an example in the sustainable management of its oil reserves .

this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .
we shall have to wait to determine if a real revolution is underway . - david berridged , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .

the social democrats have called for a faster nuclear phase-out plan - currently planned for 2020 - and stressed the importance of closing eight of the oldest reactors without further ado .
for their part , the christian democrats have reiterated calls to extend the operating lives of the nation 's plants on the grounds that the technology is perfectly safe .
but a survey conducted by the research institute , emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper , has revealed many reservations towards nuclear energy among normal germans .
some 72 percent of the 501 people asked said they would like to see kruemmel and other older reactors closed down .
looking ahead to elections sweden 's vattenfall , which operates the plant in northern germany , has said the short-circuit last saturday was an isolated incident which should not be blown out of proportion or used to bolster an anti-nuclear election campaign .
" to use the incident as an instrument is wrong , " said european head of vattenfall , tuomo hatakka , in the news journal focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear opponents want cleaner fuel sources he said the safety of the reactor had never been compromised and that to suggest otherwise was " irresponsible " towards the public .
german conservative politicians have also accused the opposition of trying to use the incident to win over voters ahead of september elections .
state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , told daily die welt that spd environment minister sigmar gabriel was trying " to show the spd leadership how to turn an issue into a campaign platform , " by playing with people 's fears .
vattenfall has invited people who live near the kruemmel plant to attend an information and discussion session on saturday in a bid to keep them abreast of what is going on on their doorsteps. tkw / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "

the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but he added that tehran would " act on it accordingly " if that were to change .
the declaration from from g-8 said there was " serious concern " among the world 's most powerful countries at the way the iranian republic cracked down on opposition followers protesting the outcome of june elections .
leaders also called for a negotiated resolution of the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , naming the g-20 summit in september as the deadline .

tehran has repeatedly rejected claims that it has plans to make atomic weapons , insisting instead that its nuclear program is purely in pursuit of energy .
taking a clear stance but obama said he hoped the leadership in iran would look at the statement and realize that world opinion was clear .
" the international community has said : ' here 's a door , you can walk through .
that allows you to lessen tensions and more fully join the international community ' . "

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "

the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "

the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ghana has travelled a long and often difficult path to reach this status . it could have been one of those african countries that fulfills all the negative stereotypes .
in 1957 , ghana became the first african nation to win independence from britain , and for a long time , it seemed as if this state on the gulf of guinea was headed in the wrong direction .
president kwame nkrumah 's botched attempt to introduce socialism to modern ghana resulted in a massive financial crisis , high national debt and corruption .
in the years that followed , a series of military coups ended with the ascension to power of flight lieutenant jerry rawlings in 1981 .
his reign of terror and repression lasted for 11 years , although he did manage to advance ghana 's economy .
the imf and the world bank began to praise ghana 's economic and political stability in ever-louder tones .
rawlings had managed an about-face , and in 1992 , he emerged as the victor from elections that were more or less free and fair .
clinton visit marks turn-around in 1998 , former us president bill clinton became the first us leader to visit ghana , and he showered rawlings with accolades .
clinton described ghana 's development as part of a new african renaissance , not least because something very unusual happens in ghana : state rulers voluntarily step down or end their terms in office in an orderly fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's elections serve as an example to other african countries that was the case with rawlings , and then with john kuffuor .
and if ghana remains true to its reputation , it will also be the case with john atta-mills of the national democratic congress .
he took office this year after a run-off against the new patriotic party , marking the second time that power had been transferred from one legitimately elected leader to another .
ghana 's economy is continuing a pattern of strong growth , despite the fact that the national debt has climbed dramatically in recent years .
the financial crisis has been tough on the world 's second-biggest cocoa producer .
but the discovery of oil reserves off the coast is reviving the country 's colonial-era name : gold coast .
ghana , however , is determined not to follow the inglorious example of nigeria , where corruption means poverty is rampant despite the country 's vast oil wealth .
in contrast , ghana aims to also set an example in the sustainable management of its oil reserves .

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial .

muslims accuse the german government of playing down the matter . around 150 students in tehran threw eggs and demonstrated outside the german embassy building in the iranian capital on saturday shouting " death to germany ! and " down with racist europeans ! "
the protests were in response to the murder of a pregnant egyptian woman in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden on july 1 and the perceived low-profile response of the german government .
on saturday in dresden , several hundred people gathered to honor 31-year-old marwa al sherbini , a pharmacist fatally stabbed by a russian-born immigrant . the public memorial in dresden , organized by local civil rights groups , attracted some 800 people , including the egyptian ambassador and officials from the state of saxony , where dresden is located . veil murder dubbed the " veil murder " by muslim groups , al sherbini , who was three months pregnant , was stabbed at least 18 times in front of her husband and their three-year-old son by a russian-born german man in the courtroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding photo of egyptian marwa al sherbini , stabbed to death in a dresden courtroom she had previously successfully sued the man for damages after he was found guilty of insulting her for wearing a headscarf in a children 's playground . the 28-year-old man , identified only as alex w. , had appealed against the conviction and fine , and the fatal attack took place during the appeal hearing .

" the german press buried the report of the murder on the back pages and have since focused on the issue of security in german courts rather than the racist aspect of the killing . german government takes one week to issue response the incident occurred on july 1 but the german government took until july 8 to issue a statement of condolence . this was followed up by a letter written by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and sent to his egyptian counterpart ahmed abul gheit expressing his condolences to the woman 's family . chancellor angela merkel expressed germany 's condolences to egyptian president hosny mubarak on the fringes of the g8 summit in italy on thursday .

fourteen years after some 8,000 muslim men and boys died , experts are still working to identify all the remains . a mass funeral ceremony was held just outside the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica on saturday in a ritual that has been repeated on this date for the past six years .
more than 20,000 gathered for the burial of 534 newly identified victims on the 14th anniversary of the wartime massacre in the bosnian town .
the victims ' caskets were carried by mourners from hand to hand to their graves following a prayer at a cemetery just outside the eastern town .
those buried saturday were just some of victims of the estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys who were victims of the srebrenica massacre of july 1995 .
they were killed by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site the remains of those buried on saturday were identified by investigators over the past year .
it is a painstaking process , involving broken bodies and multiple mass graves , dna matching and loved ones who are seeking any kind of solace they can get , even 14 years after the world learned of the shocking events of that summer . " the genocide was so horrific , it is difficult for me to find words to do it justice , " said zumra sehomerovic , a member of one of the groups formed after the war to make sure those killed in 1995 get a proper burial . " this worst genocide since the second world war was committed in full view , for the entire world to see , " she added .
" everyone could observe what happened here . " memories of loved ones on saturday , tens of thousands of bosnian muslims paid tribute to victims of the massacre .
national radio reported that thousands of people boarded buses and cars to head to the eastern town for the commemoration ceremony . munevera begic , whose father hajrudin is among the newly buried victims , is still haunted by the memory of the last time she saw him . " i was 14 then .
he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .
i was not that lucky , " mehmedovic said . former base , now memorial the site of the massacre is now the srebrenica-potocari memorial and cemetery .
part of the site is an old warehouse , which in 1995 was part of a base for around 400 dutch peacekeepers .
they were stationed there after the international body declared srebrenica a " safe area " in 1993 . now it houses a display of portraits of some of the victims , with short biographies in both bosnian and english .
visitors can also watch a short film documenting the massacre . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslim women sit at the potocari cemetery amra begic does not need a film to remember the massacre ; she lives with it every day , having lost both her father and her grandfather in the slaughter . witnesses have described how after shooting the victims , the perpetrators checked the bodies to see if they were really dead .
if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot . " identification efforts the international commission of missing persons has six facilities in bosnia and herzegovina where work continues to identify the remains of the victims of the country 's bloody 1992-95 war . at the lukavac re-association center mortuary outside of tuzla , they are still trying to identify the remains of people who were moved from the original mass graves used in the massacre , to so-called secondary mass graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gravestones at the srebrenica-potocari massacre site because heavy machinery was used to do this , the remains of many bodies were broken up .
sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .
we are still somewhere in 1995 . " author : chuck penfold / rb editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .

chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .

i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .
we shall have to wait to determine if a real revolution is underway . - david berridged , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but he added that tehran would " act on it accordingly " if that were to change .
the declaration from from g-8 said there was " serious concern " among the world 's most powerful countries at the way the iranian republic cracked down on opposition followers protesting the outcome of june elections .
leaders also called for a negotiated resolution of the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , naming the g-20 summit in september as the deadline .
patience wo n't last forever us president barack obama said that although the g-8 were willing to provide tehran with the time to find a solution , there was a limit to their patience .

"
tehran has repeatedly rejected claims that it has plans to make atomic weapons , insisting instead that its nuclear program is purely in pursuit of energy .
taking a clear stance but obama said he hoped the leadership in iran would look at the statement and realize that world opinion was clear .
" the international community has said : ' here 's a door , you can walk through .
that allows you to lessen tensions and more fully join the international community ' . "

before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .

yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .

the social democrats have called for a faster nuclear phase-out plan - currently planned for 2020 - and stressed the importance of closing eight of the oldest reactors without further ado .
for their part , the christian democrats have reiterated calls to extend the operating lives of the nation 's plants on the grounds that the technology is perfectly safe .
but a survey conducted by the research institute , emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper , has revealed many reservations towards nuclear energy among normal germans .
some 72 percent of the 501 people asked said they would like to see kruemmel and other older reactors closed down .
looking ahead to elections sweden 's vattenfall , which operates the plant in northern germany , has said the short-circuit last saturday was an isolated incident which should not be blown out of proportion or used to bolster an anti-nuclear election campaign .
" to use the incident as an instrument is wrong , " said european head of vattenfall , tuomo hatakka , in the news journal focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear opponents want cleaner fuel sources he said the safety of the reactor had never been compromised and that to suggest otherwise was " irresponsible " towards the public .
german conservative politicians have also accused the opposition of trying to use the incident to win over voters ahead of september elections .
state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , told daily die welt that spd environment minister sigmar gabriel was trying " to show the spd leadership how to turn an issue into a campaign platform , " by playing with people 's fears .
vattenfall has invited people who live near the kruemmel plant to attend an information and discussion session on saturday in a bid to keep them abreast of what is going on on their doorsteps. tkw / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but he added that tehran would " act on it accordingly " if that were to change .
the declaration from from g-8 said there was " serious concern " among the world 's most powerful countries at the way the iranian republic cracked down on opposition followers protesting the outcome of june elections .

tehran has repeatedly rejected claims that it has plans to make atomic weapons , insisting instead that its nuclear program is purely in pursuit of energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess smith sits with her family , wearing traditional dress bearing the images of president barack obama and ghana 's president john atta mills after delivering the keynote speech , the president , who is travelling with his family , paid an emotional visit to a former slave trading fortress .
the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 11.07.2009 f1 : vettel looking for perfect birthday present at german grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension is mounting in formula one in 2009 , formula one 's traditional form book has gone out of the window .
big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

the offer comes as a relief to porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking who has been locked in a power struggle with the head of vw , ferdinand piech .
the deal would enable porsche to get out from under a debt of nine billion euros that it accrued while attempting to take over volkswagen in 2008 .
the global economic downturn derailed porsche 's efforts .
porsche currently has a 51 percent share of volkswagen .
vw had made a counter offer of three to four billion euros in june , but that offer was rejected by porsche .
according to reports , vw recently upped its offer to considerably more than four billion euros .
porsche has confirmed that it will hold an extraordinary meeting of its supervisory board on july 23 where it will decide whether to accept the offer from qia .
if successful qia would also get access to shares that would enable it to control about 20 percent of volkswagen at a very attractive price .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , controls just over 20 percent of the company. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the social democrats have called for a faster nuclear phase-out plan - currently planned for 2020 - and stressed the importance of closing eight of the oldest reactors without further ado .
for their part , the christian democrats have reiterated calls to extend the operating lives of the nation 's plants on the grounds that the technology is perfectly safe .
but a survey conducted by the research institute , emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper , has revealed many reservations towards nuclear energy among normal germans .
some 72 percent of the 501 people asked said they would like to see kruemmel and other older reactors closed down .
looking ahead to elections sweden 's vattenfall , which operates the plant in northern germany , has said the short-circuit last saturday was an isolated incident which should not be blown out of proportion or used to bolster an anti-nuclear election campaign .
" to use the incident as an instrument is wrong , " said european head of vattenfall , tuomo hatakka , in the news journal focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear opponents want cleaner fuel sources he said the safety of the reactor had never been compromised and that to suggest otherwise was " irresponsible " towards the public .
german conservative politicians have also accused the opposition of trying to use the incident to win over voters ahead of september elections .
state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , told daily die welt that spd environment minister sigmar gabriel was trying " to show the spd leadership how to turn an issue into a campaign platform , " by playing with people 's fears .
vattenfall has invited people who live near the kruemmel plant to attend an information and discussion session on saturday in a bid to keep them abreast of what is going on on their doorsteps. tkw / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the offer comes as a relief to porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking who has been locked in a power struggle with the head of vw , ferdinand piech .
the deal would enable porsche to get out from under a debt of nine billion euros that it accrued while attempting to take over volkswagen in 2008 .
the global economic downturn derailed porsche 's efforts .
porsche currently has a 51 percent share of volkswagen .
vw had made a counter offer of three to four billion euros in june , but that offer was rejected by porsche .
according to reports , vw recently upped its offer to considerably more than four billion euros .
porsche has confirmed that it will hold an extraordinary meeting of its supervisory board on july 23 where it will decide whether to accept the offer from qia .
if successful qia would also get access to shares that would enable it to control about 20 percent of volkswagen at a very attractive price .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , controls just over 20 percent of the company. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

muslims accuse the german government of playing down the matter . around 150 students in tehran threw eggs and demonstrated outside the german embassy building in the iranian capital on saturday shouting " death to germany ! and " down with racist europeans ! "
the protests were in response to the murder of a pregnant egyptian woman in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden on july 1 and the perceived low-profile response of the german government .
on saturday in dresden , several hundred people gathered to honor 31-year-old marwa al sherbini , a pharmacist fatally stabbed by a russian-born immigrant . the public memorial in dresden , organized by local civil rights groups , attracted some 800 people , including the egyptian ambassador and officials from the state of saxony , where dresden is located . veil murder dubbed the " veil murder " by muslim groups , al sherbini , who was three months pregnant , was stabbed at least 18 times in front of her husband and their three-year-old son by a russian-born german man in the courtroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding photo of egyptian marwa al sherbini , stabbed to death in a dresden courtroom she had previously successfully sued the man for damages after he was found guilty of insulting her for wearing a headscarf in a children 's playground . the 28-year-old man , identified only as alex w. , had appealed against the conviction and fine , and the fatal attack took place during the appeal hearing .
the man had right-wing views , according to police , but no previous record of offenses . marwa al sherbini 's husband is still in a critical condition in hospital after also being stabbed by the assailant and shot in the leg by police who mistakenly took him for the attacker . demonstrations since the murder small protests have taken place in cairo and within the german domestic population .
further demonstrations are planned for sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people carry the coffin of marwa al sherbini in alexandria , egypt on july 6 what has surprised and angered muslims in germany and elsewhere is the slow response made by the german government to the incident and the apparent indifference of the german press . the berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel asked on thursday : " why was the death of a veiled woman , who was not the victim of an ' honor crime ' , only news in brief for a whole week ? " the german press buried the report of the murder on the back pages and have since focused on the issue of security in german courts rather than the racist aspect of the killing . german government takes one week to issue response the incident occurred on july 1 but the german government took until july 8 to issue a statement of condolence . this was followed up by a letter written by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and sent to his egyptian counterpart ahmed abul gheit expressing his condolences to the woman 's family . chancellor angela merkel expressed germany 's condolences to egyptian president hosny mubarak on the fringes of the g8 summit in italy on thursday .

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess smith sits with her family , wearing traditional dress bearing the images of president barack obama and ghana 's president john atta mills after delivering the keynote speech , the president , who is travelling with his family , paid an emotional visit to a former slave trading fortress .
the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday in dresden , several hundred people gathered to honor 31-year-old marwa al sherbini , a pharmacist fatally stabbed by a russian-born immigrant . the public memorial in dresden , organized by local civil rights groups , attracted some 800 people , including the egyptian ambassador and officials from the state of saxony , where dresden is located . veil murder dubbed the " veil murder " by muslim groups , al sherbini , who was three months pregnant , was stabbed at least 18 times in front of her husband and their three-year-old son by a russian-born german man in the courtroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding photo of egyptian marwa al sherbini , stabbed to death in a dresden courtroom she had previously successfully sued the man for damages after he was found guilty of insulting her for wearing a headscarf in a children 's playground . the 28-year-old man , identified only as alex w. , had appealed against the conviction and fine , and the fatal attack took place during the appeal hearing .

" the german press buried the report of the murder on the back pages and have since focused on the issue of security in german courts rather than the racist aspect of the killing . german government takes one week to issue response the incident occurred on july 1 but the german government took until july 8 to issue a statement of condolence . this was followed up by a letter written by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and sent to his egyptian counterpart ahmed abul gheit expressing his condolences to the woman 's family . chancellor angela merkel expressed germany 's condolences to egyptian president hosny mubarak on the fringes of the g8 summit in italy on thursday .

the social democrats have called for a faster nuclear phase-out plan - currently planned for 2020 - and stressed the importance of closing eight of the oldest reactors without further ado .
for their part , the christian democrats have reiterated calls to extend the operating lives of the nation 's plants on the grounds that the technology is perfectly safe .
but a survey conducted by the research institute , emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper , has revealed many reservations towards nuclear energy among normal germans .
some 72 percent of the 501 people asked said they would like to see kruemmel and other older reactors closed down .
looking ahead to elections sweden 's vattenfall , which operates the plant in northern germany , has said the short-circuit last saturday was an isolated incident which should not be blown out of proportion or used to bolster an anti-nuclear election campaign .
" to use the incident as an instrument is wrong , " said european head of vattenfall , tuomo hatakka , in the news journal focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear opponents want cleaner fuel sources he said the safety of the reactor had never been compromised and that to suggest otherwise was " irresponsible " towards the public .

state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , told daily die welt that spd environment minister sigmar gabriel was trying " to show the spd leadership how to turn an issue into a campaign platform , " by playing with people 's fears .

the social democrats have called for a faster nuclear phase-out plan - currently planned for 2020 - and stressed the importance of closing eight of the oldest reactors without further ado .
for their part , the christian democrats have reiterated calls to extend the operating lives of the nation 's plants on the grounds that the technology is perfectly safe .
but a survey conducted by the research institute , emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper , has revealed many reservations towards nuclear energy among normal germans .
some 72 percent of the 501 people asked said they would like to see kruemmel and other older reactors closed down .
looking ahead to elections sweden 's vattenfall , which operates the plant in northern germany , has said the short-circuit last saturday was an isolated incident which should not be blown out of proportion or used to bolster an anti-nuclear election campaign .
" to use the incident as an instrument is wrong , " said european head of vattenfall , tuomo hatakka , in the news journal focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear opponents want cleaner fuel sources he said the safety of the reactor had never been compromised and that to suggest otherwise was " irresponsible " towards the public .
german conservative politicians have also accused the opposition of trying to use the incident to win over voters ahead of september elections .
state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , told daily die welt that spd environment minister sigmar gabriel was trying " to show the spd leadership how to turn an issue into a campaign platform , " by playing with people 's fears .
vattenfall has invited people who live near the kruemmel plant to attend an information and discussion session on saturday in a bid to keep them abreast of what is going on on their doorsteps. tkw / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .

chancellor unveils germany 's g-8 plans i agree with chancellor merkel 's suggestion to expand the g-8 to g-20 .
i would suggest that it also include prominent developing countries .
it is precisely the emerging economies -lrb- china , india , brazil , russia , columbia , and others -rrb- as well as developing countries that will be the key to economic stabilization , for the g-8 , provided that effective measures are put into place through imf and world bank along with financial controls and oversight . - rolf boll , us should the dollar be replaced as the " world currency ? "
no .
i do not have much confidence in any other currency .
the chinese are simply angry at the previous administration for the " currency manipulator " attitude , now they want to show some attitude too . - krasimir , bulgaria i wish some day that my country will not be indicated as an islamic republic as it has been on your website .
the islamic regime is illegitimate and has not been elected by the iranian people .
iranians have been held hostage and the hostage taker is the islamic regime .
i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .

i hope the g-8 members wo n't recognize this government and condemn their actions against the oppressed and innocent people .
i hope that no european government will sign an oil contract with the islamic regime , ignoring the iranian people who are the real owners of the oil . - banafshe irani , iran the chinese government ’ s terrorist policy in east turkstan ignited the deadly conflict between uyghurs and the chinese .
wang le quan , the top secretary of ccp in east turkstan , is antagonizing the uyghurs .
most of the clashes between the chinese and uyghurs are due to wang le quan 's terrorist local policy .
wang creates more and more enemies so that he can be a hero with his hard crackdown .
he is masterminding the whole region for his political future .
this is how hu jin tao , the chinese president , did it in tibet before he was elected as president for his hard fisted approach in tibet . - tohkti abduwayet , us former chancellor kohl resigns from late wife 's foundation it is a great tragedy that mr. kohl should be remembered for the shennanigans that came out at the end of his political career and now this , his stepping down as the honorary chairman 's post of the foundation named after his deceased wife .
this probably proves the point that all politicians ' lives end in failure and ignominy .
however , this should not detract from the fact that he faithfully and fiercely fought and achieved the reunification of germany . - raja mandakalathoor venkataraghavan , india eu pulls ambassadors from honduras in wake of presidential ousting as a honduran i would like to express my absolute disappointment in a president turned leftist at his midterm , who has failed to send a budget to congress for almost eight months now , and who disrespects the resolutions of the supreme court , national elections tribunal , congress and the attorney general .
he should be judged in trial for his transgressions .
but he should not have been taken at midnight and thrown in an airplane to exile .
i think he should face trial and be judged .
but i do not agree with the way he was arrested and taken into exile .
the eu should remember that honduras is a very poor country and the cutting of economic aid could be disastrous to innocent people .
both sides of the story should be heard before calling other measures . - rocio aguilar , honduras nobel laureate stiglitz : " real risk that we 'll be worse off than before the crisis " the western world existed on credit , extended largely by china , japan and other asian economies .
it was governments who were complicit in this .
banks only did what they were allowed to do .
and it was the relatively unregulated investment " banks " and the toxic rating agencies that are the most to blame .
in australasia , where investment excesses were limited to investment companies , the banking sector is strong .
the us has massive involvement in very expensive and unwinnable wars , and has been living far beyond its means for years , due to excruciating bad economic policy .
couple that with the distortions due to production , price and export subsidies , and other non-tariff barriers in america and europe , and it is no wonder the third world suffers .
we have to get far more sophisticated in our policy than merely throwing more money at the problem which is stiglitz 's solution .
i support the chinese idea of replacing the us dollar with sdrs for international trade .
we should share environmental technology with each other .
we should encourage poor countries to find their own way , instead of arrogantly dictating to them .
and we have to help each other to overcome the environmental problems which loom as far , far more serious threats than the present economic blip .
economic downturns may make us a little poorer - environmental problems will kill people and destroy civilizations . - kelvin duncan , new zealand german fuel cell plane takes maiden flight all-electric powered vechicles are coming closer , despite a present day recharge time of up to six hours .
what must be carefully monitored in this area is a proclaimed new breakthrough to counter the current lithium-ion battery .
made by eestor , this is a new design that claims to have a recharge time of only five minutes at one-tenth the weight of the conventional electric car battery .
it is a private company , yet 10.7 per cent owned by publically traded firm zenn motors of canada .
before september 1 of this year , a commercial prototype of this battery array is to be made .
there is much secrecy and controversy around the project and any speculative investment in zenn in order to own a portion of eestor .

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess smith sits with her family , wearing traditional dress bearing the images of president barack obama and ghana 's president john atta mills after delivering the keynote speech , the president , who is travelling with his family , paid an emotional visit to a former slave trading fortress .
the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

big players have struggled , brawn gp rose from the ashes to dominate early on and germany 's sebastian vettel has become f1 's newest superstar . the politics of formula one and the ongoing threat of a breakaway series from the major manufacturers continue to overshadow the 2009 german grand prix , but on the track the season is hotting up .
after the early domination of brawn gp and veteran british driver jenson button , who won six of the first seven races , a new power seems to be rising on the grid .
germany 's baby-faced sebastian vettel - who turned 22 last friday - is still in the hunt to become the youngest f1 world champion ever .
but vettel knows that to stand a chance of shaking jenson button 's commanding lead in the drivers ' standings , he needs another good result this weekend .
" i felt very at home in the car .
that 's the most important thing , " vettel said after setting the second fastest time in friday practice .
" however , it seems to be a little tighter at the top than in silverstone , where the brawns perhaps struggled with a few problems , while everything was running perfectly for us . "
vettel won the british grand prix in silverstone comfortably , with his red bull car stealing the show from the competition .
now , he has his first ever chance in a competitive car on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian vettel and red bull are on a winning streak " obviously , it 's special to be here , being a german taking part in the german grand prix , just as it must have been for jenson -lrb- button -rrb- and lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- at silverstone , " he said . when the season roared into action , neither red bull nor brawn had the odds in their favour , but button , vettel and teammates rubens barrichello and mark webber have benefited from major rule changes .
other f1 drivers and constructors however , have performed far worse than they had hoped . mixed fortunes for germany 's other speedsters nick heidfeld 's bmw sauber has looked nothing like the race-winning car and championship contender that it was in 2008 .
seocnd place in the wet and wild malaysian grand prix was the team 's best result of the season , but it owed more to the veteran heidfeld 's racecraft than to the strength of his car .
nico rosberg has had another respectable season with low-budget privateer outfit williams .
he 's scored points in the last four races , but still might be wondering whether he could be better placed in the championship than seventh if he and the team had capitalized on their speed early in the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo glock took third place in malaysia timo glock has experienced every extreme in his cologne-built toyota this season .
glock started the year well , grabbing a podium in malaysia .
then in china , it looked like the team would secure their first ever victory when glock and his teammate jarno trulli locked out the front row of the grid .
however , tactical errors cost them the race and toyota has backpedalled ever since .
the team is hoping to re-establish itself as a front-runner in germany .
adrian sutil - driving with the underfunded minnows force india - has performed well this season , considering the resources at his disposal .
however , at circuits like silverstone where the force india looked competitive , bad luck has cost him a chance at scoring some valuable world championship points .
force india is the only f1 team yet to score this year .
the green hell the german grand prix and the nuerburgring , are institutions on the formula one calendar .
the circuit has been completely reworked since the first f1 races there in the 1950s as the classic nuerburgring nordschleife - a gruelling , narrow 21 kilometer circuit - is too dangerous for modern formula one cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun for the whole family at nuerburgring " for a quick lap at the nuerburgring , you 've probably experienced more in seven minutes and six or seven seconds than most people have experienced in all their life in the way of fear , in the way of tension , in the way of animosity towards machinery and to a racetrack , " multiple world champion and safety campaigner jackie stewart wrote of the nordschleife circuit .
the " green hell " as stewart famously described the track was replaced with what is known as the " gp cirucuit " in 1984 .
it is shorter , wider and safer , but critics say it will forever lie in the shadow of its more exciting elder sister .
two and half decades later , and the nuerburgring has added a new hospitality center , a museum , a rollercoaster , a disco , restaurants , bars , a holiday park and a hotel - all designed to tempt visitors into buying more than just a ticket for the race .
this new complex is an attempt to again profit from a formula one race weekend .
currently , circuits pay such large fees to f1 's commercial supremo bernnie ecclestone that they often lose money .
the hockenheim circuit , contracted to host germany 's 2010 grand prix , has already said that it needs financial support to do so .
but with the rise of another german f1 star in sebastian vettel , the circuits will be hoping for a return to profit through ticket sales , as was the case during michael schumacher 's illustrious career .
" to be perfectly honest , sebastian vettel is like a birthday present for us , " nuerburgring ceo dr. walter kafitz told german newspaper die welt .

the offer comes as a relief to porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking who has been locked in a power struggle with the head of vw , ferdinand piech .
the deal would enable porsche to get out from under a debt of nine billion euros that it accrued while attempting to take over volkswagen in 2008 .
the global economic downturn derailed porsche 's efforts .
porsche currently has a 51 percent share of volkswagen .
vw had made a counter offer of three to four billion euros in june , but that offer was rejected by porsche .
according to reports , vw recently upped its offer to considerably more than four billion euros .
porsche has confirmed that it will hold an extraordinary meeting of its supervisory board on july 23 where it will decide whether to accept the offer from qia .
if successful qia would also get access to shares that would enable it to control about 20 percent of volkswagen at a very attractive price .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , controls just over 20 percent of the company. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was holding my hand and then they separated us .
i still see that picture of him being taken away , " she said through tears .
" he did not live to see any of his grandchildren . " hatidza mehmedovic , who is in her late 60s , is still searching for her son 's remains . " beside the whole tragedy we have gone through we should be happy when we find the bones of our child .

if not , they finished the job with a single shot to the head .
that is how begic 's father met his end . " when they finished identification of my father , they said that it was a bullet straight to the head , " she said .
" the most horrible thing is that i was thinking that i was sorry because he was alive five minutes longer , so he suffered a lot .

the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .

sometimes different parts ended up in different graves . just a few kilometers down the road in tuzla , investigators at another office enter dna data from victims into computers which look for matches with dna samples provided by family members .
often , only parts of a particular victim are identified with any certainty .
the family is then given the option of burying those remains , or waiting in the hope that investigators will find more . many of the bodies that were buried at the cemetery outside of srebrenica on saturday are incomplete .
but the families clearly hope that the funeral will help ease the pain , ever so slightly . still , one question nags at even those who have already buried their dead .
why wasn ’ t the un-designated safe area actually safe ?
why could n't 400 dutch peacekeepers with united nations backing prevent a mass slaughter ? " they didn ’ t do anything , " said begic .
" if someone knows why they didn ’ t do anything , please explain to us .
it is very hard to live with everything .

porsche currently has a 51 percent share of volkswagen .
vw had made a counter offer of three to four billion euros in june , but that offer was rejected by porsche .

but ghana has travelled a long and often difficult path to reach this status . it could have been one of those african countries that fulfills all the negative stereotypes .
in 1957 , ghana became the first african nation to win independence from britain , and for a long time , it seemed as if this state on the gulf of guinea was headed in the wrong direction .
president kwame nkrumah 's botched attempt to introduce socialism to modern ghana resulted in a massive financial crisis , high national debt and corruption .
in the years that followed , a series of military coups ended with the ascension to power of flight lieutenant jerry rawlings in 1981 .
his reign of terror and repression lasted for 11 years , although he did manage to advance ghana 's economy .
the imf and the world bank began to praise ghana 's economic and political stability in ever-louder tones .
rawlings had managed an about-face , and in 1992 , he emerged as the victor from elections that were more or less free and fair .
clinton visit marks turn-around in 1998 , former us president bill clinton became the first us leader to visit ghana , and he showered rawlings with accolades .
clinton described ghana 's development as part of a new african renaissance , not least because something very unusual happens in ghana : state rulers voluntarily step down or end their terms in office in an orderly fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's elections serve as an example to other african countries that was the case with rawlings , and then with john kuffuor .
and if ghana remains true to its reputation , it will also be the case with john atta-mills of the national democratic congress .
he took office this year after a run-off against the new patriotic party , marking the second time that power had been transferred from one legitimately elected leader to another .
ghana 's economy is continuing a pattern of strong growth , despite the fact that the national debt has climbed dramatically in recent years .
the financial crisis has been tough on the world 's second-biggest cocoa producer .
but the discovery of oil reserves off the coast is reviving the country 's colonial-era name : gold coast .
ghana , however , is determined not to follow the inglorious example of nigeria , where corruption means poverty is rampant despite the country 's vast oil wealth .
in contrast , ghana aims to also set an example in the sustainable management of its oil reserves .

the offer comes as a relief to porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking who has been locked in a power struggle with the head of vw , ferdinand piech .
the deal would enable porsche to get out from under a debt of nine billion euros that it accrued while attempting to take over volkswagen in 2008 .
the global economic downturn derailed porsche 's efforts .
porsche currently has a 51 percent share of volkswagen .
vw had made a counter offer of three to four billion euros in june , but that offer was rejected by porsche .
according to reports , vw recently upped its offer to considerably more than four billion euros .
porsche has confirmed that it will hold an extraordinary meeting of its supervisory board on july 23 where it will decide whether to accept the offer from qia .
if successful qia would also get access to shares that would enable it to control about 20 percent of volkswagen at a very attractive price .
the german state of lower saxony , where vw has its headquarters , controls just over 20 percent of the company. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

obama was on a 24-hour visit to ghana .
he said he chose stable , democratic ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama and first lady michelle obama meet with pope benedict xvi , friday , july 10 , 2009 , at the vatican .
obama came from italy , where he had been attending the group of eight summit in l 'aquila , and had an audience with pope benedict xvi at the vatican , and flew overnight to the ghanaian capital , accra .
yes , we can !
ghanaians , many dressed in obama t-shirts , packed into the streets of accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
but security was very tight and no public events had been planned .
before obama began to address the ghanaian parliament , mp 's chanted " yes , we can , " the president 's well-known campaign slogan .
during his substantial speech , long by western standards , yet fairly brief by african , obama said that africa 's future is up to africans : " i say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world .
i have the blood of africa within me , and my family 's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger african story . "
self-responsibility was a theme he reiterated .
" make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power … .with better governance , i have no doubt that africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity . "
youth holds the key he had a special message for young people : " you have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people .
you can serve in your communities , and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world .
you can conquer disease , end conflicts , and make change from the bottom up . "
and , echoing his slogan once more , he repeated his mantra , " you can do that .
yes , you can . "

the obama family was taken on a guided tour of cape coast castle , the starting place of a long , inhuman and often deadly journey to the americas for hundreds of thousand of slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries .
obama said the tour was a " moving experience ... a moving moment . "
the obamas were led to the fort 's notorious " door of no return , " from which those being taken away had a last look at the continent they would never see again .
" as painful as it is , i think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , " obama told reporters as he concluded his official visit .
a large crowd gave president obama a rapturous send off from accra airport before he and his family began the flight back to their present home , the white house , in washington d.c. , a mansion built by slave labor at the end of the 18th century. td / afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

muslims accuse the german government of playing down the matter . around 150 students in tehran threw eggs and demonstrated outside the german embassy building in the iranian capital on saturday shouting " death to germany ! and " down with racist europeans ! "
the protests were in response to the murder of a pregnant egyptian woman in a courtroom in the eastern german city of dresden on july 1 and the perceived low-profile response of the german government .
on saturday in dresden , several hundred people gathered to honor 31-year-old marwa al sherbini , a pharmacist fatally stabbed by a russian-born immigrant . the public memorial in dresden , organized by local civil rights groups , attracted some 800 people , including the egyptian ambassador and officials from the state of saxony , where dresden is located . veil murder dubbed the " veil murder " by muslim groups , al sherbini , who was three months pregnant , was stabbed at least 18 times in front of her husband and their three-year-old son by a russian-born german man in the courtroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding photo of egyptian marwa al sherbini , stabbed to death in a dresden courtroom she had previously successfully sued the man for damages after he was found guilty of insulting her for wearing a headscarf in a children 's playground . the 28-year-old man , identified only as alex w. , had appealed against the conviction and fine , and the fatal attack took place during the appeal hearing .
the man had right-wing views , according to police , but no previous record of offenses . marwa al sherbini 's husband is still in a critical condition in hospital after also being stabbed by the assailant and shot in the leg by police who mistakenly took him for the attacker . demonstrations since the murder small protests have taken place in cairo and within the german domestic population .
further demonstrations are planned for sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people carry the coffin of marwa al sherbini in alexandria , egypt on july 6 what has surprised and angered muslims in germany and elsewhere is the slow response made by the german government to the incident and the apparent indifference of the german press . the berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel asked on thursday : " why was the death of a veiled woman , who was not the victim of an ' honor crime ' , only news in brief for a whole week ? " the german press buried the report of the murder on the back pages and have since focused on the issue of security in german courts rather than the racist aspect of the killing . german government takes one week to issue response the incident occurred on july 1 but the german government took until july 8 to issue a statement of condolence . this was followed up by a letter written by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and sent to his egyptian counterpart ahmed abul gheit expressing his condolences to the woman 's family . chancellor angela merkel expressed germany 's condolences to egyptian president hosny mubarak on the fringes of the g8 summit in italy on thursday .

ghana was chosen because of its democratic track record and mr obama is expected to use the trip to promote good governance across the continent .
he will hold talks with president john atta mills and address the country 's parliament on the subject of democracy .
he is due to visit a former slave fort and a health centre in the capital , accra , as part of his 24-hour visit .
the bbc 's will ross says president obama will find it a challenge in the current economic climate to match some of the achievements of his predecessor , george w bush , when it comes to health care in africa , especially in the fight against hiv .
the visit to the slave fort at cape coast castle will be a poignant moment for the country 's first african-american president and for his wife michelle , whose ancestors are believed to have come from west africa , our correspondent says .
tight security posters of barack and michelle obama are to be seen throughout accra , where their arrival was eagerly awaited . "
the dead can be buried later but obama is here for once and we must pay all attention to him " ama benyiwaa doe ghanaian minister , explaining suspension of funerals in cape coast ghana excitement builds for obama on arrival , president obama and his family were met by president atta mills , and treated to a colourful welcome featuring drummers and traditional dancers .
ghanaian musicians have written songs to mark the visit and it is clear that millions of ghanaians would love to see mr obama , our correspondent says .
however , there will be few opportunities for them to do so during his 24-hour stay .
when former president bill clinton came more than a decade ago , he addressed hundreds of thousands of cheering ghanaians .
but post-9/11 , security is tighter and all events are for invited guests only , our correspondent notes .
key rings and umbrellas barack obama visited sub-saharan africa while a us senator , making a trip to kenya - his father 's homeland - in august 2006 .
analysis martin plaut , bbc news for ghanaians , there is little doubt that they deserve to be mr obama 's first real african destination since assuming office .
nigeria was not really suitable , given the question marks over the way in which president umaru yar 'adua was elected .
kenya , home of mr obama 's father , experienced post-election violence .
ethiopia has jailed the leader of the opposition , and south africa 's jacob zuma is new in the post and something of an unknown quantity .
not only is ghana clearly democratic , but it has some of the african oil on which the us increasingly depends , and there is the symbolic link with slavery , from which so many african-americans trace their heritage .
so ghana ticks mr obama 's boxes - a suitable stage on which to launch the president 's africa policy on the continent itself .
mr obama 's official business on saturday includes talks with ghana 's president and a speech to parliament .
ahead of the president 's arrival late on friday , people were already out celebrating , dancing and drumming in the seaside city 's streets .
memorabilia being sold by vendors ranged from key rings and coffee mugs to handkerchiefs and umbrellas bearing portraits of mr obama and mr atta-mills .
thousands of police have been deployed for the visit and a number of city roads were closed on friday .
cape coast , a town about 160km -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- west of accra , has even suspended funerals on account of mr obama 's impending visit to its old slave fort .
" we banned all funeral activities in cape coast because we want to give a befitting welcome to the us president , " ghana 's central regional minister , ama benyiwaa doe , told afp news agency .
" the dead can be buried later but obama is here for once and we must pay all attention to him . "
squeeze on aid across the african continent , people are pinning a lot of hope on barack obama partly because of his african roots but also because of his election slogan , yes we can , our correspondent reports .
he arrived in ghana hours after leaders of the g8 industrialised countries pledged billions of dollars to boost agriculture - the main source of income for many sub-saharan africans .
but the financial climate is different from when former president bush was in office and american-funded programmes , such as the provision of medicine for people living with hiv , are facing new challenges .

the five , from the 2nd battalion the rifles , were killed in two separate blasts while on foot patrol on friday .
next of kin have been informed .
their deaths take the number of troops killed in afghanistan since 2001 to 184 and higher than the 179 killed in iraq .
foreign secretary david miliband has defended the uk 's role in afghanistan .
see a map of the conflict zone he told bbc radio 4 's today programme troops were there to " ensure that afghanistan can not again become an incubator for terrorism and a launching pad for attacks on us " .
" this is about the future of britain because we know that the borderlands of afghanistan and pakistan have been used to launch terrible attacks , not just on the us but on britain as well , " he added .
conservative leader david cameron said the " whole country will be shocked by the deaths of so many service personnel " .
bbc defence and security correspondent rob watson when british troops were first deployed to southern afghanistan three years ago the then defence secretary expressed the hope that they would complete their mission without a shot being fired .
it has instead been the most high intensity fighting british troops have faced since the korean war in the 1950s .
to critics , the ferocity of the fighting is proof of how ill thought out the whole mission has been all along .
defenders of the operation , however , say it was always bound to be difficult and that the casualties while regrettable have been suffered in a worthwhile and winnable cause .
certainly the deployment to afghanistan of around 10 % of britain 's army has proved a real strain on manpower , equipment and finances .
for now at least though , britain remains firmly committed to staying the course .
he said their bravery was " outstanding " and they were " fighting to prevent terrorism on the streets of britain " .
but he said the government " must explain its strategy in afghanistan " and deliver key equipment to troops .
" it is a scandal that our forces still lack the helicopters they desperately require to move around in helmand , " he said .
" promises of more helicopters in the future are not enough .
more helicopters are needed today .
more helicopters would save lives . "
britain 's chief of defence staff , sir jock stirrup , said britain had " taken some very sad casualties over the last several days " .
he warned of more casualties to come but insisted the taliban were " losing " in afghanistan .
the five soldiers were killed while on the same foot patrol near sangin , helmand province .
lieutenant colonel nick richardson , spokesman for task force helmand , said : " while there are no words to ease their loss , our heartfelt sympathies go to their families , friends and fellow soldiers at this very difficult time : their deaths were not in vain . "
earlier on friday , it was confirmed a british soldier from the 2nd royal tank regiment died near nad ali in helmand .
that news came just hours after the deaths of another two soldiers were announced .
' sacrifice ' those two soldiers died on thursday evening .
one was from 4th battalion the rifles and he was killed in a blast while on foot patrol near nad ali .
the second , from princess of wales 's royal regiment , attached to 1st battalion welsh guards , was killed during an engagement with insurgent forces near lashkar gah .
fifteen soldiers have died in 10 days in southern afghanistan .

the five , from the 2nd battalion the rifles , were killed in two separate blasts while on foot patrol on friday .
next of kin have been informed .
their deaths take the number of troops killed in afghanistan since 2001 to 184 and higher than the 179 killed in iraq .
foreign secretary david miliband has defended the uk 's role in afghanistan .
see a map of the conflict zone he told bbc radio 4 's today programme troops were there to " ensure that afghanistan can not again become an incubator for terrorism and a launching pad for attacks on us " .
" this is about the future of britain because we know that the borderlands of afghanistan and pakistan have been used to launch terrible attacks , not just on the us but on britain as well , " he added .
conservative leader david cameron said the " whole country will be shocked by the deaths of so many service personnel " .
bbc defence and security correspondent rob watson when british troops were first deployed to southern afghanistan three years ago the then defence secretary expressed the hope that they would complete their mission without a shot being fired .
it has instead been the most high intensity fighting british troops have faced since the korean war in the 1950s .
to critics , the ferocity of the fighting is proof of how ill thought out the whole mission has been all along .
defenders of the operation , however , say it was always bound to be difficult and that the casualties while regrettable have been suffered in a worthwhile and winnable cause .
certainly the deployment to afghanistan of around 10 % of britain 's army has proved a real strain on manpower , equipment and finances .
for now at least though , britain remains firmly committed to staying the course .
he said their bravery was " outstanding " and they were " fighting to prevent terrorism on the streets of britain " .
but he said the government " must explain its strategy in afghanistan " and deliver key equipment to troops .
" it is a scandal that our forces still lack the helicopters they desperately require to move around in helmand , " he said .
" promises of more helicopters in the future are not enough .
more helicopters are needed today .
more helicopters would save lives . "
britain 's chief of defence staff , sir jock stirrup , said britain had " taken some very sad casualties over the last several days " .
he warned of more casualties to come but insisted the taliban were " losing " in afghanistan .
the five soldiers were killed while on the same foot patrol near sangin , helmand province .
lieutenant colonel nick richardson , spokesman for task force helmand , said : " while there are no words to ease their loss , our heartfelt sympathies go to their families , friends and fellow soldiers at this very difficult time : their deaths were not in vain . "
earlier on friday , it was confirmed a british soldier from the 2nd royal tank regiment died near nad ali in helmand .
that news came just hours after the deaths of another two soldiers were announced .
' sacrifice ' those two soldiers died on thursday evening .
one was from 4th battalion the rifles and he was killed in a blast while on foot patrol near nad ali .
the second , from princess of wales 's royal regiment , attached to 1st battalion welsh guards , was killed during an engagement with insurgent forces near lashkar gah .
fifteen soldiers have died in 10 days in southern afghanistan .
