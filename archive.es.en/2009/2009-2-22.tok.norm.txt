" the chancellor said that it was not permissible to have " blank spots " where regulations do not apply .
one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile . " merkel 's proposal to introduce a global charter for sustainable economic activity was also incorporated into the joint european demands . bigger role for international monetary fund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could see its funding doubled the european leaders also put forward a plan for adding an extra 195 billion euros -lrb- $ 250 billion -rrb- - double the current level of funding - to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- so it can better help to prevent future financial crises . british prime minister gordon brown said a bolstered imf would also be able to help central and eastern european countries embroiled in a growing economic crisis as western banks pull out credit . the eu leaders also stressed the need for the g20 to implement " swiftly and completely " the 47-point action plan agreed to at the group 's last meeting of government heads in november . the meeting on sunday , feb .
22 was attended by the leaders of france , britain , spain , italy , the netherlands , luxembourg and the czech republic , the holder of the rotating eu presidency .
it was called to coordinate the bloc 's position ahead of the april summit in london of the group of 20 major economic powers . the results will be discussed by all 27 european union members at summits in march . profound changes after global turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major changes , not band-aid fixes , are necessary , sarkozy said french president nicolas sarkozy said deep changes were required to the way the world conducts business . " the violence of the crisis , its depth , call for really profound changes , " he said ahead of the meeting .
" we have to start capitalism again from scratch , make it more moral ... that is why i want to see a real response . " but sunday 's meeting comes in the wake of another week of global market turmoil , which has underscored mounting concerns about the deepening sense of crisis surrounding the financial systems in central and eastern europe as well as parts of the 16-member euro zone , notably ireland and greece . at one point last week the euro hit a three-month low against the dollar with share markets slumping sharply as the euro zone confronts its first major crisis since it was formed about a decade ago . " there has not been a worldwide recession of the scale we are seeing today for several decades , " the chairman 's statement said . light on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national rescue efforts could help economies recover but the leaders attending the sunday summit also expressed optimism about the european economic outlook as the year unfolds following the adoption of national stimulus packages . " as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the fsf was established a decade ago to boost cooperation between supervisory bodies . as part of the efforts for enhancing coordination between national supervisory authorities , the eu leaders proposed doubling state funds for the imf with the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development broadening their lending practices to shore up european states facing financial pressure . the european leaders also want to ensure greater financial market transparency and accountability by controlling bodies , such as international rating agencies and hedge funds , which at their peak before the global credit crunch set in represented an industry worth more than $ 2 trillion . reducing protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the tax havens that may feel the heat the eu leaders also want to see measures to prevent " excessive risk taking " through controls on bonus payments and a crackdown on tax havens as well as so-called " uncooperative jurisdictions " such as lichtenstein , andorra and monaco . in addition , the berlin meeting warned about the economic threat posed by protectionism as nations attempt to shield their economies from recession . " at the london summit leaders should send a powerful message to this effect , " said the chairman 's summary . the chairman 's summary also called for moves to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions through the creation of new financial market watchdogs , which will called a college of supervisors . julie gregson & sean sinico -lrb- dpa / reuters / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chancellor said that it was not permissible to have " blank spots " where regulations do not apply .
one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile . " merkel 's proposal to introduce a global charter for sustainable economic activity was also incorporated into the joint european demands . bigger role for international monetary fund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could see its funding doubled the european leaders also put forward a plan for adding an extra 195 billion euros -lrb- $ 250 billion -rrb- - double the current level of funding - to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- so it can better help to prevent future financial crises . british prime minister gordon brown said a bolstered imf would also be able to help central and eastern european countries embroiled in a growing economic crisis as western banks pull out credit . the eu leaders also stressed the need for the g20 to implement " swiftly and completely " the 47-point action plan agreed to at the group 's last meeting of government heads in november . the meeting on sunday , feb .
22 was attended by the leaders of france , britain , spain , italy , the netherlands , luxembourg and the czech republic , the holder of the rotating eu presidency .
it was called to coordinate the bloc 's position ahead of the april summit in london of the group of 20 major economic powers . the results will be discussed by all 27 european union members at summits in march . profound changes after global turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major changes , not band-aid fixes , are necessary , sarkozy said french president nicolas sarkozy said deep changes were required to the way the world conducts business . " the violence of the crisis , its depth , call for really profound changes , " he said ahead of the meeting .
" we have to start capitalism again from scratch , make it more moral ... that is why i want to see a real response . " but sunday 's meeting comes in the wake of another week of global market turmoil , which has underscored mounting concerns about the deepening sense of crisis surrounding the financial systems in central and eastern europe as well as parts of the 16-member euro zone , notably ireland and greece . at one point last week the euro hit a three-month low against the dollar with share markets slumping sharply as the euro zone confronts its first major crisis since it was formed about a decade ago . " there has not been a worldwide recession of the scale we are seeing today for several decades , " the chairman 's statement said . light on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national rescue efforts could help economies recover but the leaders attending the sunday summit also expressed optimism about the european economic outlook as the year unfolds following the adoption of national stimulus packages . " as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the fsf was established a decade ago to boost cooperation between supervisory bodies . as part of the efforts for enhancing coordination between national supervisory authorities , the eu leaders proposed doubling state funds for the imf with the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development broadening their lending practices to shore up european states facing financial pressure . the european leaders also want to ensure greater financial market transparency and accountability by controlling bodies , such as international rating agencies and hedge funds , which at their peak before the global credit crunch set in represented an industry worth more than $ 2 trillion . reducing protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the tax havens that may feel the heat the eu leaders also want to see measures to prevent " excessive risk taking " through controls on bonus payments and a crackdown on tax havens as well as so-called " uncooperative jurisdictions " such as lichtenstein , andorra and monaco . in addition , the berlin meeting warned about the economic threat posed by protectionism as nations attempt to shield their economies from recession . " at the london summit leaders should send a powerful message to this effect , " said the chairman 's summary . the chairman 's summary also called for moves to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions through the creation of new financial market watchdogs , which will called a college of supervisors . julie gregson & sean sinico -lrb- dpa / reuters / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .
he had been invited to iran by a neurosurgeon who lives in schroeder 's hometown of hannover . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .
he had been invited to iran by a neurosurgeon who lives in schroeder 's hometown of hannover . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will use my first visit to the usa in march to hold further talks " on the issue , guttenberg was quoted as saying .
the minister said that the basis of any rescue plan for gm 's german division had to be a solid proposal from the beleaguered us corporation .
" it is urgent that general motors and opel quickly present a substantial idea on how they plan to save jobs on an economically sound basis , " guttenberg said .
the minister 's remarks came one day after a report in bild that opel might go bankrupt by may or june if public assistance was not forthcoming .
a cash injection needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel needs a large amount of cash in order stay afloat opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated .
the car maker has neither confirmed nor denied these figures , while suggesting nonetheless that it needed more aid .
stressing the urgency of the situation , germany 's foreign minister also appealed for international help .
" we have to look further than our own backyard , " frank-walter steinmeier told the daily rheinische post on saturday .
" no car factory is capable of surviving alone in germany or elsewhere . "
" we must act on an international and european level to preserve jobs in a sustainable manner in russelsheim , kaiserslautern , bochum and eisenach , " he said , listing opel 's main factories in germany .
slumping auto sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing car manufacturer general motors has asked the us government to step in like its rivals , opel has been slammed by slumping auto sales , especially in europe .
directors of opel 's troubled us parent company general motors opened the door this week to an opel spin-off within the framework of a broad restructuring of gm 's whole business .
earlier this week , gm presented its shake-up plan to the us treasury on tuesday as a condition of its $ 13.4 billion -lrb- 10.5 billion euros -rrb- government bridging loan .
it pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros .
the plan also depends upon receiving six billion dollars in funding support from the governments of canada , germany , the united kingdom , sweden , and thailand " to provide liquidity specifically for gm 's operations in these countries , " it said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , for three raucous , over-the-top movies : " 1968 : tunnel rats , " " in the name of the king : a dungeon siege tale " and " postal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe boll does not respond kindly to his critics he was also awarded a special worst career achievement dishonor for an extraordinary range of fantasy and horror classics that included " zombie massacre " and " bloodrayne ii : deliverance . " boll himself did not attend the razzie award ceremony , often thought of as the anti-oscars , but was nonetheless kept in good company . canadian comic mike myers ' box office flop " the love guru " was named worst picture of 2008 , and he was named the year 's worst actor . us celebrity and actress-wanna-be paris hilton picked up three awards for worst actress for the comedy " the hottie and the nottie , " worst supporting actress for the musical " repo : the genetic opera , " and a prize for being part of the worst couple in " hottie . " pierce brosnan - formerly in the service of her majesty as special agent 007 - won worst supporting actor dishonors for " mamma mia ! " whereas " indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull " was declared the worst " prequel , remake , rip-off or sequel . " the real thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who said hotel heiresses could n't act ?
pretty much all the critics as per tradition , the 29th annual razzies took place on the night before the oscar ceremony . according to the golden raspberry award foundation , only four past winners have appeared at the ceremony in person to accept the dubious honors : director paul verhoeven , actress halle berry , screenwriter michael ferris , and actor / director tom green . the 81st academy awards on sunday night - with a celebration of glamour and glitter that embodies hollywood - will have no problems attracting international movie stars to the event , but in the midst of a debilitating recession and a slide in viewer interest , the show will feature some important changes . for a start , you wo n't see the usual line-up of stars strutting their stuff on the red carpet .
organizers believe that viewers who are mainly interested in oscar fashions tune in to watch the stars arrive and then do n't bother with the actual ceremony .
though many well-known faces will still run the red carpet gauntlet , the actual presenters will be smuggled in and kept far from prying cameras . younger and hipper ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers promise that this year 's oscars will be different as far as the presenters go , you can expect to see many more up-and-coming hollywood stars rather than the established royalty .
the idea of having youth-friendly prize givers like zac efron and vanessa hudgens is aimed at attracting young viewers - and help rid the oscars of its stuffy image . steadily declining viewership and the widening recession caused the abc network to drop its advertising prices from $ 1.8 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- per 30-second slot to $ 1.4 million . you might see the stars , but not in all their finery .
this year 's styles will tend to be muted - in deference to the grim economy . " it used to be chic to say , ' i 'm wearing $ 16 million worth of jewels ' , " publicist howard bragman told the los angeles times .
" that 's distasteful right now . " surprise strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " the baader-meinhof complex " is competing for an oscar oscar organizers are also promising other surprise strategies aimed at revitalizing the format .
host hugh jackman , recently voted the " sexiest man alive , " marks a break with previous hosts - and comedians - jerry seinfeld , whoopi goldberg and billy crystal . jackman joked that the surprises would include everyone presenting in the nude .
he also revealed that the kodak theatre would be transformed into a dream nightclub for the event , and that the prize-giving segments would be less formal than usual . outside the official oscar ceremony , the glitterati will still be feted as though the world continued to exist in the booming economy of yesteryear .
so-called gifting suites are being set up all over town where companies hoping for some publicity , will shower celebrities with all kinds of baubles . among the goodies are the yet-to be released palm pre smartphones , koolaburra sheepskin boots , milus watches worth $ 6,000 , sakroots bags , waterford crystal glasses , stuart weitzman shoes and various essential accoutrements for the trendy hollywood jet-setters . " our gift lounges backstage are not seeing any change , " organizer samantha haft told daily usa today .
" we have n't seen anyone pull out .

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .

" the chancellor said that it was not permissible to have " blank spots " where regulations do not apply .
one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile . " merkel 's proposal to introduce a global charter for sustainable economic activity was also incorporated into the joint european demands . bigger role for international monetary fund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could see its funding doubled the european leaders also put forward a plan for adding an extra 195 billion euros -lrb- $ 250 billion -rrb- - double the current level of funding - to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- so it can better help to prevent future financial crises . british prime minister gordon brown said a bolstered imf would also be able to help central and eastern european countries embroiled in a growing economic crisis as western banks pull out credit . the eu leaders also stressed the need for the g20 to implement " swiftly and completely " the 47-point action plan agreed to at the group 's last meeting of government heads in november . the meeting on sunday , feb .
22 was attended by the leaders of france , britain , spain , italy , the netherlands , luxembourg and the czech republic , the holder of the rotating eu presidency .
it was called to coordinate the bloc 's position ahead of the april summit in london of the group of 20 major economic powers . the results will be discussed by all 27 european union members at summits in march . profound changes after global turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major changes , not band-aid fixes , are necessary , sarkozy said french president nicolas sarkozy said deep changes were required to the way the world conducts business . " the violence of the crisis , its depth , call for really profound changes , " he said ahead of the meeting .
" we have to start capitalism again from scratch , make it more moral ... that is why i want to see a real response . " but sunday 's meeting comes in the wake of another week of global market turmoil , which has underscored mounting concerns about the deepening sense of crisis surrounding the financial systems in central and eastern europe as well as parts of the 16-member euro zone , notably ireland and greece . at one point last week the euro hit a three-month low against the dollar with share markets slumping sharply as the euro zone confronts its first major crisis since it was formed about a decade ago . " there has not been a worldwide recession of the scale we are seeing today for several decades , " the chairman 's statement said . light on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national rescue efforts could help economies recover but the leaders attending the sunday summit also expressed optimism about the european economic outlook as the year unfolds following the adoption of national stimulus packages . " as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the fsf was established a decade ago to boost cooperation between supervisory bodies . as part of the efforts for enhancing coordination between national supervisory authorities , the eu leaders proposed doubling state funds for the imf with the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development broadening their lending practices to shore up european states facing financial pressure . the european leaders also want to ensure greater financial market transparency and accountability by controlling bodies , such as international rating agencies and hedge funds , which at their peak before the global credit crunch set in represented an industry worth more than $ 2 trillion . reducing protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the tax havens that may feel the heat the eu leaders also want to see measures to prevent " excessive risk taking " through controls on bonus payments and a crackdown on tax havens as well as so-called " uncooperative jurisdictions " such as lichtenstein , andorra and monaco . in addition , the berlin meeting warned about the economic threat posed by protectionism as nations attempt to shield their economies from recession .

" the chancellor said that it was not permissible to have " blank spots " where regulations do not apply .
one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile .

it was called to coordinate the bloc 's position ahead of the april summit in london of the group of 20 major economic powers . the results will be discussed by all 27 european union members at summits in march . profound changes after global turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major changes , not band-aid fixes , are necessary , sarkozy said french president nicolas sarkozy said deep changes were required to the way the world conducts business . " the violence of the crisis , its depth , call for really profound changes , " he said ahead of the meeting .
" we have to start capitalism again from scratch , make it more moral ... that is why i want to see a real response . " but sunday 's meeting comes in the wake of another week of global market turmoil , which has underscored mounting concerns about the deepening sense of crisis surrounding the financial systems in central and eastern europe as well as parts of the 16-member euro zone , notably ireland and greece . at one point last week the euro hit a three-month low against the dollar with share markets slumping sharply as the euro zone confronts its first major crisis since it was formed about a decade ago . " there has not been a worldwide recession of the scale we are seeing today for several decades , " the chairman 's statement said . light on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national rescue efforts could help economies recover but the leaders attending the sunday summit also expressed optimism about the european economic outlook as the year unfolds following the adoption of national stimulus packages . " as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the fsf was established a decade ago to boost cooperation between supervisory bodies . as part of the efforts for enhancing coordination between national supervisory authorities , the eu leaders proposed doubling state funds for the imf with the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development broadening their lending practices to shore up european states facing financial pressure . the european leaders also want to ensure greater financial market transparency and accountability by controlling bodies , such as international rating agencies and hedge funds , which at their peak before the global credit crunch set in represented an industry worth more than $ 2 trillion . reducing protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the tax havens that may feel the heat the eu leaders also want to see measures to prevent " excessive risk taking " through controls on bonus payments and a crackdown on tax havens as well as so-called " uncooperative jurisdictions " such as lichtenstein , andorra and monaco . in addition , the berlin meeting warned about the economic threat posed by protectionism as nations attempt to shield their economies from recession .

it pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros .

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .
he had been invited to iran by a neurosurgeon who lives in schroeder 's hometown of hannover . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .
he had been invited to iran by a neurosurgeon who lives in schroeder 's hometown of hannover . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .

ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .

" i want to see the company 's restructuring program first , " steinbrueck said .
" i want to see what efforts it is going to take and then , as a final step , consider whether the state should provide and guarantees . " opel was the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the current economic crisis began .
it had originally projected needed 1 billion euros in loan guarantees for 2009 .

" it is urgent that general motors and opel quickly present a substantial idea on how they plan to save jobs on an economically sound basis , " guttenberg said .
the minister 's remarks came one day after a report in bild that opel might go bankrupt by may or june if public assistance was not forthcoming .

" no car factory is capable of surviving alone in germany or elsewhere . "
" we must act on an international and european level to preserve jobs in a sustainable manner in russelsheim , kaiserslautern , bochum and eisenach , " he said , listing opel 's main factories in germany .

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .
he had been invited to iran by a neurosurgeon who lives in schroeder 's hometown of hannover . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chancellor said that it was not permissible to have " blank spots " where regulations do not apply .
one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile . " merkel 's proposal to introduce a global charter for sustainable economic activity was also incorporated into the joint european demands . bigger role for international monetary fund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could see its funding doubled the european leaders also put forward a plan for adding an extra 195 billion euros -lrb- $ 250 billion -rrb- - double the current level of funding - to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- so it can better help to prevent future financial crises . british prime minister gordon brown said a bolstered imf would also be able to help central and eastern european countries embroiled in a growing economic crisis as western banks pull out credit . the eu leaders also stressed the need for the g20 to implement " swiftly and completely " the 47-point action plan agreed to at the group 's last meeting of government heads in november . the meeting on sunday , feb .
22 was attended by the leaders of france , britain , spain , italy , the netherlands , luxembourg and the czech republic , the holder of the rotating eu presidency .
it was called to coordinate the bloc 's position ahead of the april summit in london of the group of 20 major economic powers . the results will be discussed by all 27 european union members at summits in march . profound changes after global turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major changes , not band-aid fixes , are necessary , sarkozy said french president nicolas sarkozy said deep changes were required to the way the world conducts business . " the violence of the crisis , its depth , call for really profound changes , " he said ahead of the meeting .
" we have to start capitalism again from scratch , make it more moral ... that is why i want to see a real response . " but sunday 's meeting comes in the wake of another week of global market turmoil , which has underscored mounting concerns about the deepening sense of crisis surrounding the financial systems in central and eastern europe as well as parts of the 16-member euro zone , notably ireland and greece . at one point last week the euro hit a three-month low against the dollar with share markets slumping sharply as the euro zone confronts its first major crisis since it was formed about a decade ago . " there has not been a worldwide recession of the scale we are seeing today for several decades , " the chairman 's statement said . light on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national rescue efforts could help economies recover but the leaders attending the sunday summit also expressed optimism about the european economic outlook as the year unfolds following the adoption of national stimulus packages . " as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the fsf was established a decade ago to boost cooperation between supervisory bodies . as part of the efforts for enhancing coordination between national supervisory authorities , the eu leaders proposed doubling state funds for the imf with the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development broadening their lending practices to shore up european states facing financial pressure . the european leaders also want to ensure greater financial market transparency and accountability by controlling bodies , such as international rating agencies and hedge funds , which at their peak before the global credit crunch set in represented an industry worth more than $ 2 trillion . reducing protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the tax havens that may feel the heat the eu leaders also want to see measures to prevent " excessive risk taking " through controls on bonus payments and a crackdown on tax havens as well as so-called " uncooperative jurisdictions " such as lichtenstein , andorra and monaco . in addition , the berlin meeting warned about the economic threat posed by protectionism as nations attempt to shield their economies from recession . " at the london summit leaders should send a powerful message to this effect , " said the chairman 's summary . the chairman 's summary also called for moves to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions through the creation of new financial market watchdogs , which will called a college of supervisors . julie gregson & sean sinico -lrb- dpa / reuters / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will use my first visit to the usa in march to hold further talks " on the issue , guttenberg was quoted as saying .
the minister said that the basis of any rescue plan for gm 's german division had to be a solid proposal from the beleaguered us corporation .
" it is urgent that general motors and opel quickly present a substantial idea on how they plan to save jobs on an economically sound basis , " guttenberg said .
the minister 's remarks came one day after a report in bild that opel might go bankrupt by may or june if public assistance was not forthcoming .
a cash injection needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel needs a large amount of cash in order stay afloat opel reportedly needs a cash injection of up to 3.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , but has not found a bank willing to fund the required credits , the newspaper stated .
the car maker has neither confirmed nor denied these figures , while suggesting nonetheless that it needed more aid .
stressing the urgency of the situation , germany 's foreign minister also appealed for international help .
" we have to look further than our own backyard , " frank-walter steinmeier told the daily rheinische post on saturday .
" no car factory is capable of surviving alone in germany or elsewhere . "
" we must act on an international and european level to preserve jobs in a sustainable manner in russelsheim , kaiserslautern , bochum and eisenach , " he said , listing opel 's main factories in germany .
slumping auto sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing car manufacturer general motors has asked the us government to step in like its rivals , opel has been slammed by slumping auto sales , especially in europe .
directors of opel 's troubled us parent company general motors opened the door this week to an opel spin-off within the framework of a broad restructuring of gm 's whole business .
earlier this week , gm presented its shake-up plan to the us treasury on tuesday as a condition of its $ 13.4 billion -lrb- 10.5 billion euros -rrb- government bridging loan .
it pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros .
the plan also depends upon receiving six billion dollars in funding support from the governments of canada , germany , the united kingdom , sweden , and thailand " to provide liquidity specifically for gm 's operations in these countries , " it said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german politicians ca n't agree how much aid to dole out or who should get it . speaking at a press conference following a gathering of european union leaders on sunday , feb .
22 , in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said the european car makers should have a " fair chance " in competition with auto groups from other parts of the world . merkel said this included not only competition with us car manufacturers , as the question of state aid for the european car sector is to be discussed at a special eu summit set down for march 1 . we have a common market , " said merkel , adding that european leaders meeting in berlin agreed any national stimulus measures and financial rescue plans would have to be created in a way that " limits distortions to competition to an absolute minimum . " level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auto sales are down in both the united states and europe the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - would be responsible for making sure eu members do not provide aid to domestic markets at other countries ' expense , she added . the announcement comes as tension in the 27-member bloc increased after france unveiled plans to support its key auto makers with 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- . french president nicolas sarkozy had added to the friction by suggesting that french car makers should relocate their eastern european plants to france to save french jobs . speaking at sunday 's press conference , sarkozy declined comment on the issue , but said he agreed with merkel and that the subject would be discussed at the march 1 summit , which would include all the eu 's leaders . european observers have also been paying close attention to us carmaker general motors as the auto giant announces plans for its european subsidiaries the american company has already forced its swedish brand saab to file for protection against bankruptcy and the future of germany 's opel remains uncertain . a spokesman for gm 's opel operation told german radio sunday that the group had drawn up a rescue plan to allow the group to restructure . possible aid for opel controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future will likely depend on its restructuring plan this would help opel meet the demands of merkel and other german political leaders for the group to prepare a restructuring plan before considering state aid for the ailing car maker .
german politicians have been unwilling to bail out opel without guarantees it would not flow into gm 's accounts in the united states . " if the state helps opel now , then it will have to help bmw tomorrow , and then daimler the next day and all the car parts suppliers , " hans-olaf henkel , a former president of the german bdi industry federation and ibm europe chief executive , told german radio .
" and overnight , before we even noticed what hit us , we will have brought back communist east germany . " not paying to support opel would also have serious economic effects .
german finance minster peer steinbrueck told german public broadcaster ard allowing the company to collapse could cost between as much as 3 billion euros and up to 50,000 jobs in the german automobile industry . no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has n't yet promised to provide any money to opel he , however , stopped short of promising to help opel regardless of the cost . " i want to see the company 's restructuring program first , " steinbrueck said .
" i want to see what efforts it is going to take and then , as a final step , consider whether the state should provide and guarantees . " opel was the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the current economic crisis began .
it had originally projected needed 1 billion euros in loan guarantees for 2009 .
however , media reports show the carmaker will revise that figure to as much as 3.3 billion euros to stay in business until 2011 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , for three raucous , over-the-top movies : " 1968 : tunnel rats , " " in the name of the king : a dungeon siege tale " and " postal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe boll does not respond kindly to his critics he was also awarded a special worst career achievement dishonor for an extraordinary range of fantasy and horror classics that included " zombie massacre " and " bloodrayne ii : deliverance . " boll himself did not attend the razzie award ceremony , often thought of as the anti-oscars , but was nonetheless kept in good company . canadian comic mike myers ' box office flop " the love guru " was named worst picture of 2008 , and he was named the year 's worst actor . us celebrity and actress-wanna-be paris hilton picked up three awards for worst actress for the comedy " the hottie and the nottie , " worst supporting actress for the musical " repo : the genetic opera , " and a prize for being part of the worst couple in " hottie . " pierce brosnan - formerly in the service of her majesty as special agent 007 - won worst supporting actor dishonors for " mamma mia ! " whereas " indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull " was declared the worst " prequel , remake , rip-off or sequel . " the real thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who said hotel heiresses could n't act ?
pretty much all the critics as per tradition , the 29th annual razzies took place on the night before the oscar ceremony . according to the golden raspberry award foundation , only four past winners have appeared at the ceremony in person to accept the dubious honors : director paul verhoeven , actress halle berry , screenwriter michael ferris , and actor / director tom green . the 81st academy awards on sunday night - with a celebration of glamour and glitter that embodies hollywood - will have no problems attracting international movie stars to the event , but in the midst of a debilitating recession and a slide in viewer interest , the show will feature some important changes . for a start , you wo n't see the usual line-up of stars strutting their stuff on the red carpet .
organizers believe that viewers who are mainly interested in oscar fashions tune in to watch the stars arrive and then do n't bother with the actual ceremony .
though many well-known faces will still run the red carpet gauntlet , the actual presenters will be smuggled in and kept far from prying cameras . younger and hipper ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers promise that this year 's oscars will be different as far as the presenters go , you can expect to see many more up-and-coming hollywood stars rather than the established royalty .
the idea of having youth-friendly prize givers like zac efron and vanessa hudgens is aimed at attracting young viewers - and help rid the oscars of its stuffy image . steadily declining viewership and the widening recession caused the abc network to drop its advertising prices from $ 1.8 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- per 30-second slot to $ 1.4 million . you might see the stars , but not in all their finery .
this year 's styles will tend to be muted - in deference to the grim economy . " it used to be chic to say , ' i 'm wearing $ 16 million worth of jewels ' , " publicist howard bragman told the los angeles times .
" that 's distasteful right now . " surprise strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " the baader-meinhof complex " is competing for an oscar oscar organizers are also promising other surprise strategies aimed at revitalizing the format .
host hugh jackman , recently voted the " sexiest man alive , " marks a break with previous hosts - and comedians - jerry seinfeld , whoopi goldberg and billy crystal . jackman joked that the surprises would include everyone presenting in the nude .
he also revealed that the kodak theatre would be transformed into a dream nightclub for the event , and that the prize-giving segments would be less formal than usual . outside the official oscar ceremony , the glitterati will still be feted as though the world continued to exist in the booming economy of yesteryear .
so-called gifting suites are being set up all over town where companies hoping for some publicity , will shower celebrities with all kinds of baubles . among the goodies are the yet-to be released palm pre smartphones , koolaburra sheepskin boots , milus watches worth $ 6,000 , sakroots bags , waterford crystal glasses , stuart weitzman shoes and various essential accoutrements for the trendy hollywood jet-setters . " our gift lounges backstage are not seeing any change , " organizer samantha haft told daily usa today .
" we have n't seen anyone pull out .
it 's business as usual .
it 's a perfect opportunity to get your products into the hands of celebrities and build some buzz . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , for three raucous , over-the-top movies : " 1968 : tunnel rats , " " in the name of the king : a dungeon siege tale " and " postal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe boll does not respond kindly to his critics he was also awarded a special worst career achievement dishonor for an extraordinary range of fantasy and horror classics that included " zombie massacre " and " bloodrayne ii : deliverance . " boll himself did not attend the razzie award ceremony , often thought of as the anti-oscars , but was nonetheless kept in good company . canadian comic mike myers ' box office flop " the love guru " was named worst picture of 2008 , and he was named the year 's worst actor . us celebrity and actress-wanna-be paris hilton picked up three awards for worst actress for the comedy " the hottie and the nottie , " worst supporting actress for the musical " repo : the genetic opera , " and a prize for being part of the worst couple in " hottie . " pierce brosnan - formerly in the service of her majesty as special agent 007 - won worst supporting actor dishonors for " mamma mia ! " whereas " indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull " was declared the worst " prequel , remake , rip-off or sequel . " the real thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who said hotel heiresses could n't act ?
pretty much all the critics as per tradition , the 29th annual razzies took place on the night before the oscar ceremony . according to the golden raspberry award foundation , only four past winners have appeared at the ceremony in person to accept the dubious honors : director paul verhoeven , actress halle berry , screenwriter michael ferris , and actor / director tom green . the 81st academy awards on sunday night - with a celebration of glamour and glitter that embodies hollywood - will have no problems attracting international movie stars to the event , but in the midst of a debilitating recession and a slide in viewer interest , the show will feature some important changes . for a start , you wo n't see the usual line-up of stars strutting their stuff on the red carpet .
organizers believe that viewers who are mainly interested in oscar fashions tune in to watch the stars arrive and then do n't bother with the actual ceremony .
though many well-known faces will still run the red carpet gauntlet , the actual presenters will be smuggled in and kept far from prying cameras . younger and hipper ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers promise that this year 's oscars will be different as far as the presenters go , you can expect to see many more up-and-coming hollywood stars rather than the established royalty .
the idea of having youth-friendly prize givers like zac efron and vanessa hudgens is aimed at attracting young viewers - and help rid the oscars of its stuffy image . steadily declining viewership and the widening recession caused the abc network to drop its advertising prices from $ 1.8 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- per 30-second slot to $ 1.4 million . you might see the stars , but not in all their finery .
this year 's styles will tend to be muted - in deference to the grim economy . " it used to be chic to say , ' i 'm wearing $ 16 million worth of jewels ' , " publicist howard bragman told the los angeles times .
" that 's distasteful right now . " surprise strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " the baader-meinhof complex " is competing for an oscar oscar organizers are also promising other surprise strategies aimed at revitalizing the format .

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .

schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .

the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .

" the chancellor said that it was not permissible to have " blank spots " where regulations do not apply .
one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile . " merkel 's proposal to introduce a global charter for sustainable economic activity was also incorporated into the joint european demands . bigger role for international monetary fund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could see its funding doubled the european leaders also put forward a plan for adding an extra 195 billion euros -lrb- $ 250 billion -rrb- - double the current level of funding - to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- so it can better help to prevent future financial crises . british prime minister gordon brown said a bolstered imf would also be able to help central and eastern european countries embroiled in a growing economic crisis as western banks pull out credit . the eu leaders also stressed the need for the g20 to implement " swiftly and completely " the 47-point action plan agreed to at the group 's last meeting of government heads in november . the meeting on sunday , feb .
22 was attended by the leaders of france , britain , spain , italy , the netherlands , luxembourg and the czech republic , the holder of the rotating eu presidency .
it was called to coordinate the bloc 's position ahead of the april summit in london of the group of 20 major economic powers . the results will be discussed by all 27 european union members at summits in march . profound changes after global turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major changes , not band-aid fixes , are necessary , sarkozy said french president nicolas sarkozy said deep changes were required to the way the world conducts business . " the violence of the crisis , its depth , call for really profound changes , " he said ahead of the meeting .
" we have to start capitalism again from scratch , make it more moral ... that is why i want to see a real response . " but sunday 's meeting comes in the wake of another week of global market turmoil , which has underscored mounting concerns about the deepening sense of crisis surrounding the financial systems in central and eastern europe as well as parts of the 16-member euro zone , notably ireland and greece . at one point last week the euro hit a three-month low against the dollar with share markets slumping sharply as the euro zone confronts its first major crisis since it was formed about a decade ago . " there has not been a worldwide recession of the scale we are seeing today for several decades , " the chairman 's statement said . light on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national rescue efforts could help economies recover but the leaders attending the sunday summit also expressed optimism about the european economic outlook as the year unfolds following the adoption of national stimulus packages . " as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the fsf was established a decade ago to boost cooperation between supervisory bodies . as part of the efforts for enhancing coordination between national supervisory authorities , the eu leaders proposed doubling state funds for the imf with the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development broadening their lending practices to shore up european states facing financial pressure . the european leaders also want to ensure greater financial market transparency and accountability by controlling bodies , such as international rating agencies and hedge funds , which at their peak before the global credit crunch set in represented an industry worth more than $ 2 trillion . reducing protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the tax havens that may feel the heat the eu leaders also want to see measures to prevent " excessive risk taking " through controls on bonus payments and a crackdown on tax havens as well as so-called " uncooperative jurisdictions " such as lichtenstein , andorra and monaco . in addition , the berlin meeting warned about the economic threat posed by protectionism as nations attempt to shield their economies from recession . " at the london summit leaders should send a powerful message to this effect , " said the chairman 's summary . the chairman 's summary also called for moves to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions through the creation of new financial market watchdogs , which will called a college of supervisors . julie gregson & sean sinico -lrb- dpa / reuters / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the fsf was established a decade ago to boost cooperation between supervisory bodies . as part of the efforts for enhancing coordination between national supervisory authorities , the eu leaders proposed doubling state funds for the imf with the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development broadening their lending practices to shore up european states facing financial pressure . the european leaders also want to ensure greater financial market transparency and accountability by controlling bodies , such as international rating agencies and hedge funds , which at their peak before the global credit crunch set in represented an industry worth more than $ 2 trillion . reducing protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is one of the tax havens that may feel the heat the eu leaders also want to see measures to prevent " excessive risk taking " through controls on bonus payments and a crackdown on tax havens as well as so-called " uncooperative jurisdictions " such as lichtenstein , andorra and monaco . in addition , the berlin meeting warned about the economic threat posed by protectionism as nations attempt to shield their economies from recession . " at the london summit leaders should send a powerful message to this effect , " said the chairman 's summary . the chairman 's summary also called for moves to monitor all major cross-border financial institutions through the creation of new financial market watchdogs , which will called a college of supervisors . julie gregson & sean sinico -lrb- dpa / reuters / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , for three raucous , over-the-top movies : " 1968 : tunnel rats , " " in the name of the king : a dungeon siege tale " and " postal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe boll does not respond kindly to his critics he was also awarded a special worst career achievement dishonor for an extraordinary range of fantasy and horror classics that included " zombie massacre " and " bloodrayne ii : deliverance . " boll himself did not attend the razzie award ceremony , often thought of as the anti-oscars , but was nonetheless kept in good company . canadian comic mike myers ' box office flop " the love guru " was named worst picture of 2008 , and he was named the year 's worst actor . us celebrity and actress-wanna-be paris hilton picked up three awards for worst actress for the comedy " the hottie and the nottie , " worst supporting actress for the musical " repo : the genetic opera , " and a prize for being part of the worst couple in " hottie . " pierce brosnan - formerly in the service of her majesty as special agent 007 - won worst supporting actor dishonors for " mamma mia ! " whereas " indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull " was declared the worst " prequel , remake , rip-off or sequel . " the real thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who said hotel heiresses could n't act ?
pretty much all the critics as per tradition , the 29th annual razzies took place on the night before the oscar ceremony . according to the golden raspberry award foundation , only four past winners have appeared at the ceremony in person to accept the dubious honors : director paul verhoeven , actress halle berry , screenwriter michael ferris , and actor / director tom green . the 81st academy awards on sunday night - with a celebration of glamour and glitter that embodies hollywood - will have no problems attracting international movie stars to the event , but in the midst of a debilitating recession and a slide in viewer interest , the show will feature some important changes . for a start , you wo n't see the usual line-up of stars strutting their stuff on the red carpet .
organizers believe that viewers who are mainly interested in oscar fashions tune in to watch the stars arrive and then do n't bother with the actual ceremony .
though many well-known faces will still run the red carpet gauntlet , the actual presenters will be smuggled in and kept far from prying cameras . younger and hipper ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers promise that this year 's oscars will be different as far as the presenters go , you can expect to see many more up-and-coming hollywood stars rather than the established royalty .
the idea of having youth-friendly prize givers like zac efron and vanessa hudgens is aimed at attracting young viewers - and help rid the oscars of its stuffy image . steadily declining viewership and the widening recession caused the abc network to drop its advertising prices from $ 1.8 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- per 30-second slot to $ 1.4 million . you might see the stars , but not in all their finery .
this year 's styles will tend to be muted - in deference to the grim economy . " it used to be chic to say , ' i 'm wearing $ 16 million worth of jewels ' , " publicist howard bragman told the los angeles times .
" that 's distasteful right now . " surprise strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " the baader-meinhof complex " is competing for an oscar oscar organizers are also promising other surprise strategies aimed at revitalizing the format .
host hugh jackman , recently voted the " sexiest man alive , " marks a break with previous hosts - and comedians - jerry seinfeld , whoopi goldberg and billy crystal . jackman joked that the surprises would include everyone presenting in the nude .
he also revealed that the kodak theatre would be transformed into a dream nightclub for the event , and that the prize-giving segments would be less formal than usual . outside the official oscar ceremony , the glitterati will still be feted as though the world continued to exist in the booming economy of yesteryear .
so-called gifting suites are being set up all over town where companies hoping for some publicity , will shower celebrities with all kinds of baubles . among the goodies are the yet-to be released palm pre smartphones , koolaburra sheepskin boots , milus watches worth $ 6,000 , sakroots bags , waterford crystal glasses , stuart weitzman shoes and various essential accoutrements for the trendy hollywood jet-setters . " our gift lounges backstage are not seeing any change , " organizer samantha haft told daily usa today .
" we have n't seen anyone pull out .

but german politicians ca n't agree how much aid to dole out or who should get it . speaking at a press conference following a gathering of european union leaders on sunday , feb .
22 , in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said the european car makers should have a " fair chance " in competition with auto groups from other parts of the world . merkel said this included not only competition with us car manufacturers , as the question of state aid for the european car sector is to be discussed at a special eu summit set down for march 1 . we have a common market , " said merkel , adding that european leaders meeting in berlin agreed any national stimulus measures and financial rescue plans would have to be created in a way that " limits distortions to competition to an absolute minimum .

german politicians have been unwilling to bail out opel without guarantees it would not flow into gm 's accounts in the united states . " if the state helps opel now , then it will have to help bmw tomorrow , and then daimler the next day and all the car parts suppliers , " hans-olaf henkel , a former president of the german bdi industry federation and ibm europe chief executive , told german radio .
" and overnight , before we even noticed what hit us , we will have brought back communist east germany . " not paying to support opel would also have serious economic effects .
german finance minster peer steinbrueck told german public broadcaster ard allowing the company to collapse could cost between as much as 3 billion euros and up to 50,000 jobs in the german automobile industry . no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has n't yet promised to provide any money to opel he , however , stopped short of promising to help opel regardless of the cost . " i want to see the company 's restructuring program first , " steinbrueck said .
" i want to see what efforts it is going to take and then , as a final step , consider whether the state should provide and guarantees . " opel was the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the current economic crisis began .
it had originally projected needed 1 billion euros in loan guarantees for 2009 .
however , media reports show the carmaker will revise that figure to as much as 3.3 billion euros to stay in business until 2011 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .

" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-

in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .

until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past .

21 , behind closed doors in the president 's offices .
a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .
a private visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder urged iran to participate in finding a solution for the mideast probelm schroeder , in iran on a private visit , also met with parliament president ali larijani and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki .
in contrast to the tense meeting with ahmadinejad , schroeder 's meeting with former iranian president mohammad khatami - who plans to run against ahmadinejad in the june elections - was congenial .
the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .
opening a dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has often made it clear that it does not believe in israel 's right to exist schroeder emphasized during the meeting that after 30 years , iran should accept the offer of the new us president barack obama to open a dialogue .
schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .

in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .
taking responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder was invited to iran by german-based iranian neurosurgeon majid samii , left schroeder said iran needed to take responsibility and respect international rules , if the country wanted to be taken seriously as a regional power .
the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .
" the relations between teheran and berlin are too important to be overshadowed by a subject such as the holocaust , " attar said .
during his time in office -lrb- 1998-2005 -rrb- , schroeder never visited iran .
he had been invited to iran by a neurosurgeon who lives in schroeder 's hometown of hannover . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will use my first visit to the usa in march to hold further talks " on the issue , guttenberg was quoted as saying .
the minister said that the basis of any rescue plan for gm 's german division had to be a solid proposal from the beleaguered us corporation .
" it is urgent that general motors and opel quickly present a substantial idea on how they plan to save jobs on an economically sound basis , " guttenberg said .

but german politicians ca n't agree how much aid to dole out or who should get it . speaking at a press conference following a gathering of european union leaders on sunday , feb .
22 , in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said the european car makers should have a " fair chance " in competition with auto groups from other parts of the world . merkel said this included not only competition with us car manufacturers , as the question of state aid for the european car sector is to be discussed at a special eu summit set down for march 1 . we have a common market , " said merkel , adding that european leaders meeting in berlin agreed any national stimulus measures and financial rescue plans would have to be created in a way that " limits distortions to competition to an absolute minimum . " level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auto sales are down in both the united states and europe the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - would be responsible for making sure eu members do not provide aid to domestic markets at other countries ' expense , she added . the announcement comes as tension in the 27-member bloc increased after france unveiled plans to support its key auto makers with 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.7 billion -rrb- . french president nicolas sarkozy had added to the friction by suggesting that french car makers should relocate their eastern european plants to france to save french jobs . speaking at sunday 's press conference , sarkozy declined comment on the issue , but said he agreed with merkel and that the subject would be discussed at the march 1 summit , which would include all the eu 's leaders . european observers have also been paying close attention to us carmaker general motors as the auto giant announces plans for its european subsidiaries the american company has already forced its swedish brand saab to file for protection against bankruptcy and the future of germany 's opel remains uncertain . a spokesman for gm 's opel operation told german radio sunday that the group had drawn up a rescue plan to allow the group to restructure . possible aid for opel controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future will likely depend on its restructuring plan this would help opel meet the demands of merkel and other german political leaders for the group to prepare a restructuring plan before considering state aid for the ailing car maker .
german politicians have been unwilling to bail out opel without guarantees it would not flow into gm 's accounts in the united states . " if the state helps opel now , then it will have to help bmw tomorrow , and then daimler the next day and all the car parts suppliers , " hans-olaf henkel , a former president of the german bdi industry federation and ibm europe chief executive , told german radio .
" and overnight , before we even noticed what hit us , we will have brought back communist east germany . " not paying to support opel would also have serious economic effects .
german finance minster peer steinbrueck told german public broadcaster ard allowing the company to collapse could cost between as much as 3 billion euros and up to 50,000 jobs in the german automobile industry . no guarantees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has n't yet promised to provide any money to opel he , however , stopped short of promising to help opel regardless of the cost . " i want to see the company 's restructuring program first , " steinbrueck said .
" i want to see what efforts it is going to take and then , as a final step , consider whether the state should provide and guarantees . " opel was the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the current economic crisis began .
it had originally projected needed 1 billion euros in loan guarantees for 2009 .
however , media reports show the carmaker will revise that figure to as much as 3.3 billion euros to stay in business until 2011 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile .

pretty much all the critics as per tradition , the 29th annual razzies took place on the night before the oscar ceremony . according to the golden raspberry award foundation , only four past winners have appeared at the ceremony in person to accept the dubious honors : director paul verhoeven , actress halle berry , screenwriter michael ferris , and actor / director tom green . the 81st academy awards on sunday night - with a celebration of glamour and glitter that embodies hollywood - will have no problems attracting international movie stars to the event , but in the midst of a debilitating recession and a slide in viewer interest , the show will feature some important changes . for a start , you wo n't see the usual line-up of stars strutting their stuff on the red carpet .
organizers believe that viewers who are mainly interested in oscar fashions tune in to watch the stars arrive and then do n't bother with the actual ceremony .
though many well-known faces will still run the red carpet gauntlet , the actual presenters will be smuggled in and kept far from prying cameras . younger and hipper ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers promise that this year 's oscars will be different as far as the presenters go , you can expect to see many more up-and-coming hollywood stars rather than the established royalty .
the idea of having youth-friendly prize givers like zac efron and vanessa hudgens is aimed at attracting young viewers - and help rid the oscars of its stuffy image . steadily declining viewership and the widening recession caused the abc network to drop its advertising prices from $ 1.8 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- per 30-second slot to $ 1.4 million . you might see the stars , but not in all their finery .
this year 's styles will tend to be muted - in deference to the grim economy . " it used to be chic to say , ' i 'm wearing $ 16 million worth of jewels ' , " publicist howard bragman told the los angeles times .
" that 's distasteful right now . " surprise strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " the baader-meinhof complex " is competing for an oscar oscar organizers are also promising other surprise strategies aimed at revitalizing the format .
host hugh jackman , recently voted the " sexiest man alive , " marks a break with previous hosts - and comedians - jerry seinfeld , whoopi goldberg and billy crystal . jackman joked that the surprises would include everyone presenting in the nude .
he also revealed that the kodak theatre would be transformed into a dream nightclub for the event , and that the prize-giving segments would be less formal than usual . outside the official oscar ceremony , the glitterati will still be feted as though the world continued to exist in the booming economy of yesteryear .
so-called gifting suites are being set up all over town where companies hoping for some publicity , will shower celebrities with all kinds of baubles . among the goodies are the yet-to be released palm pre smartphones , koolaburra sheepskin boots , milus watches worth $ 6,000 , sakroots bags , waterford crystal glasses , stuart weitzman shoes and various essential accoutrements for the trendy hollywood jet-setters . " our gift lounges backstage are not seeing any change , " organizer samantha haft told daily usa today .
" we have n't seen anyone pull out .
it 's business as usual .
it 's a perfect opportunity to get your products into the hands of celebrities and build some buzz . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pretty much all the critics as per tradition , the 29th annual razzies took place on the night before the oscar ceremony . according to the golden raspberry award foundation , only four past winners have appeared at the ceremony in person to accept the dubious honors : director paul verhoeven , actress halle berry , screenwriter michael ferris , and actor / director tom green . the 81st academy awards on sunday night - with a celebration of glamour and glitter that embodies hollywood - will have no problems attracting international movie stars to the event , but in the midst of a debilitating recession and a slide in viewer interest , the show will feature some important changes . for a start , you wo n't see the usual line-up of stars strutting their stuff on the red carpet .
organizers believe that viewers who are mainly interested in oscar fashions tune in to watch the stars arrive and then do n't bother with the actual ceremony .

the idea of having youth-friendly prize givers like zac efron and vanessa hudgens is aimed at attracting young viewers - and help rid the oscars of its stuffy image . steadily declining viewership and the widening recession caused the abc network to drop its advertising prices from $ 1.8 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- per 30-second slot to $ 1.4 million . you might see the stars , but not in all their finery .
this year 's styles will tend to be muted - in deference to the grim economy . " it used to be chic to say , ' i 'm wearing $ 16 million worth of jewels ' , " publicist howard bragman told the los angeles times .
" that 's distasteful right now . " surprise strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " the baader-meinhof complex " is competing for an oscar oscar organizers are also promising other surprise strategies aimed at revitalizing the format .
host hugh jackman , recently voted the " sexiest man alive , " marks a break with previous hosts - and comedians - jerry seinfeld , whoopi goldberg and billy crystal . jackman joked that the surprises would include everyone presenting in the nude .
he also revealed that the kodak theatre would be transformed into a dream nightclub for the event , and that the prize-giving segments would be less formal than usual . outside the official oscar ceremony , the glitterati will still be feted as though the world continued to exist in the booming economy of yesteryear .
so-called gifting suites are being set up all over town where companies hoping for some publicity , will shower celebrities with all kinds of baubles . among the goodies are the yet-to be released palm pre smartphones , koolaburra sheepskin boots , milus watches worth $ 6,000 , sakroots bags , waterford crystal glasses , stuart weitzman shoes and various essential accoutrements for the trendy hollywood jet-setters . " our gift lounges backstage are not seeing any change , " organizer samantha haft told daily usa today .
" we have n't seen anyone pull out .

21 , for three raucous , over-the-top movies : " 1968 : tunnel rats , " " in the name of the king : a dungeon siege tale " and " postal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe boll does not respond kindly to his critics he was also awarded a special worst career achievement dishonor for an extraordinary range of fantasy and horror classics that included " zombie massacre " and " bloodrayne ii : deliverance . " boll himself did not attend the razzie award ceremony , often thought of as the anti-oscars , but was nonetheless kept in good company . canadian comic mike myers ' box office flop " the love guru " was named worst picture of 2008 , and he was named the year 's worst actor . us celebrity and actress-wanna-be paris hilton picked up three awards for worst actress for the comedy " the hottie and the nottie , " worst supporting actress for the musical " repo : the genetic opera , " and a prize for being part of the worst couple in " hottie . " pierce brosnan - formerly in the service of her majesty as special agent 007 - won worst supporting actor dishonors for " mamma mia ! " whereas " indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull " was declared the worst " prequel , remake , rip-off or sequel . " the real thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who said hotel heiresses could n't act ?
pretty much all the critics as per tradition , the 29th annual razzies took place on the night before the oscar ceremony . according to the golden raspberry award foundation , only four past winners have appeared at the ceremony in person to accept the dubious honors : director paul verhoeven , actress halle berry , screenwriter michael ferris , and actor / director tom green . the 81st academy awards on sunday night - with a celebration of glamour and glitter that embodies hollywood - will have no problems attracting international movie stars to the event , but in the midst of a debilitating recession and a slide in viewer interest , the show will feature some important changes . for a start , you wo n't see the usual line-up of stars strutting their stuff on the red carpet .
organizers believe that viewers who are mainly interested in oscar fashions tune in to watch the stars arrive and then do n't bother with the actual ceremony .
though many well-known faces will still run the red carpet gauntlet , the actual presenters will be smuggled in and kept far from prying cameras . younger and hipper ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers promise that this year 's oscars will be different as far as the presenters go , you can expect to see many more up-and-coming hollywood stars rather than the established royalty .
the idea of having youth-friendly prize givers like zac efron and vanessa hudgens is aimed at attracting young viewers - and help rid the oscars of its stuffy image . steadily declining viewership and the widening recession caused the abc network to drop its advertising prices from $ 1.8 million -lrb- 1.4 million euros -rrb- per 30-second slot to $ 1.4 million . you might see the stars , but not in all their finery .
this year 's styles will tend to be muted - in deference to the grim economy . " it used to be chic to say , ' i 'm wearing $ 16 million worth of jewels ' , " publicist howard bragman told the los angeles times .
" that 's distasteful right now . " surprise strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " the baader-meinhof complex " is competing for an oscar oscar organizers are also promising other surprise strategies aimed at revitalizing the format .
host hugh jackman , recently voted the " sexiest man alive , " marks a break with previous hosts - and comedians - jerry seinfeld , whoopi goldberg and billy crystal . jackman joked that the surprises would include everyone presenting in the nude .
he also revealed that the kodak theatre would be transformed into a dream nightclub for the event , and that the prize-giving segments would be less formal than usual . outside the official oscar ceremony , the glitterati will still be feted as though the world continued to exist in the booming economy of yesteryear .
so-called gifting suites are being set up all over town where companies hoping for some publicity , will shower celebrities with all kinds of baubles . among the goodies are the yet-to be released palm pre smartphones , koolaburra sheepskin boots , milus watches worth $ 6,000 , sakroots bags , waterford crystal glasses , stuart weitzman shoes and various essential accoutrements for the trendy hollywood jet-setters . " our gift lounges backstage are not seeing any change , " organizer samantha haft told daily usa today .
" we have n't seen anyone pull out .
it 's business as usual .
it 's a perfect opportunity to get your products into the hands of celebrities and build some buzz . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chancellor said that it was not permissible to have " blank spots " where regulations do not apply .
one of merkel 's coups was to incorporate a demand for the supervision of hedge funds into the european summary statement , despite initial resistance from britain , where many hedge funds are based . another was to draw up a list of countries and regions which " refuse to cooperate internationally " with a view to taking action against tax havens . the draft statement said the leaders agreed " all financial markets , products and participants must be subject to appropriate oversight or regulation , without exception and regardless of their country of domicile . " merkel 's proposal to introduce a global charter for sustainable economic activity was also incorporated into the joint european demands . bigger role for international monetary fund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could see its funding doubled the european leaders also put forward a plan for adding an extra 195 billion euros -lrb- $ 250 billion -rrb- - double the current level of funding - to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- so it can better help to prevent future financial crises . british prime minister gordon brown said a bolstered imf would also be able to help central and eastern european countries embroiled in a growing economic crisis as western banks pull out credit . the eu leaders also stressed the need for the g20 to implement " swiftly and completely " the 47-point action plan agreed to at the group 's last meeting of government heads in november . the meeting on sunday , feb .
22 was attended by the leaders of france , britain , spain , italy , the netherlands , luxembourg and the czech republic , the holder of the rotating eu presidency .
it was called to coordinate the bloc 's position ahead of the april summit in london of the group of 20 major economic powers . the results will be discussed by all 27 european union members at summits in march . profound changes after global turmoil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major changes , not band-aid fixes , are necessary , sarkozy said french president nicolas sarkozy said deep changes were required to the way the world conducts business . " the violence of the crisis , its depth , call for really profound changes , " he said ahead of the meeting .
" we have to start capitalism again from scratch , make it more moral ... that is why i want to see a real response . " but sunday 's meeting comes in the wake of another week of global market turmoil , which has underscored mounting concerns about the deepening sense of crisis surrounding the financial systems in central and eastern europe as well as parts of the 16-member euro zone , notably ireland and greece . at one point last week the euro hit a three-month low against the dollar with share markets slumping sharply as the euro zone confronts its first major crisis since it was formed about a decade ago . " there has not been a worldwide recession of the scale we are seeing today for several decades , " the chairman 's statement said . light on the horizon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national rescue efforts could help economies recover but the leaders attending the sunday summit also expressed optimism about the european economic outlook as the year unfolds following the adoption of national stimulus packages . " as these measures take effect over the coming months they will tangibly support growth , " the statement said . with this in mind , the leaders have also called for efforts aimed at helping to thaw credit markets which seized up following the us mortgage market meltdown more than year ago and have been a key factor in driving the global economy into a downturn . added protections in the meantime , the leaders have proposed creating " effective early warning mechanisms " to face up to financial firestorms in the future . these would be coordinated by a strengthened international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a brief statement afterwards said the two had exchanged ideas about regional and international issues .
ahmadinejad also urged global cooperation to solve the world 's problems .
in berlin , germany 's central council of jews criticized schroeder 's plan to meet with ahmadinejad , who has denied that the holocaust occurred .
in tehran , schroeder commented that iran appeared to have good intentions for a new beginning in relations to the west , but developments had not gone as one had hoped .
schroeder said iran and the west should set a goal of not letting talks collapse , as they have in the past years , but rather of bringing them to a successful conclusion .
eyewitnesses said the meeting took place in a tense and cool atmosphere .
there were hints that the meeting could have been cancelled after schroeder 's earlier remarks , but diplomatic channels kept it alive .

the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-

schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .

the former german chancellor added that comments about the holocaust would merely distract from attempts to find a common solution to the mideast conflict .
iranian officials reacted promptly to the criticism of the former german chancellor .
the head of the iranian chamber of industry and commerce mohammad nahawandian said , " to find common solutions , we should n't forget the recent massacre of people in gaza and should internationally condemn israel for it . "
it would be wrong to " measure the developments in the middle east with two yardsticks , " nahwandian added .
iran 's ambassador in berlin , aliresa sheikh-attar , did n't think schroeder 's criticism of ahmadinejad would damage ties between the two countries .

the two politicians spoke german , which khatami learned when he lived in hamburg as a moderate cleric before the islamic revolution in 1979 .
" we are good and old friends and when we were both in office , the countries had the best relations , " khatami told dpa news service after the meeting .
khatami said efforts were in gear to find a diplomatic solution in the conflict over iran 's uranium enrichment program , which has produced more than 1,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium , according to a report released this past week by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea . -rrb-
the amount , if subjected to further processing , would be enough to create an atomic weapon , according to non-proliferation experts .

schroeder said iran could play a positive role in afghanistan , for example by supporting kabul in its fight against the drug trade , and in iraq and in the middle east .
ahmadinejad has greeted the possibility of talks with the united states , but also demanded apologies for its alleged mistreatment of iran and talks at the highest level .
the us has charged that iran backs islamist militants in the region to stir up trouble and increase its influence .
in germany , the general secretary of the central council of jews stephan kramer criticized the schroeder-ahmadinejad meeting in an interview with the hanover daily neue presse : " mr. schroeder is greatly damaging the reputation of germany and the german government . "
kramer said that by meeting the iranian president , schroeder was supporting ahmadinejad and his government , and appealed for the former chancellor to cancel his engagement , " on the grounds of human rights . "
in his speech to the iranian chamber of industry and commerce in teheran , the former german chancellor criticized the iranian president 's stance against israel and denial of holocaust history .
" the holocaust is an historic fact and there is no sense in denying this unparalleled crime , " schroeder said .

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .

this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tending the windmills has been an arduous task for human technicians .
rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely . " the inspection system consists of three elements : an infrared radiator conducts heat to the surface of the rotor blades , a high-resolution thermal camera records the temperature pattern and thus registers flaws in the material , and an ultrasonic system and a high resolution camera are also on board , thus enabling the robot to detect damage that would remain hidden to the human eye . a specially developed carrier system ensures that the inspection robot is guided securely and precisely along the surface of a rotor blade . the advantage of this system is that it can do its job on any wind energy converter - regardless of whether it is large or small , on land or offshore , where wind farms are increasingly being built . the robot delivers an exact log of the rotor blade condition , and reportedly never fails to spot hairline cracks or other potential problems . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rotor blade damage is a routine but annoying problem that entails many hours of maintenance . but now , scientists at the fraunhofer institute for factory operation and automation -lrb- iff -rrb- in germany have said they are perfecting a generation of robots which will be able to monitor and maintain wind turbine generators on a round-the-clock basis . their latest development is riwea , a robot that inspects the rotor blades of wind energy converters . primarily made of glass-fiber reinforced plastics , rotor blades have to withstand wind , inertial forces , erosion , and other forces .
until now , humans have inspected wind energy converters at regular intervals in a time-consuming process that involves the technicians closely examining large surfaces - a rotor blade can be up to 60 meters in length - at airy heights . better than humans the researchers say they hope to make some of those inspections a thing of the past . " our robot is not just a good climber , " said dr. norbert elkmann , a project manager at the fraunhofer iff .
" it is equipped with a number of advanced sensor systems .
this enables it to inspect rotor blades closely .

the uk-born 62-year-old 's fortune has enabled him to pay millions of pounds in donations to the tories since the early 1980s .
he has been credited with helping to rescue the party 's finances in the past , once stepping in to personally guarantee its overdraft when it was reportedly £ 3m in the red .
but labour mps have long questioned whether donations through the uk-registered company bearwood complied with strict laws banning overseas contributions , and the electoral commission has now announced an investigation .
business genius lord ashcroft was partly brought up in belize and reportedly maintains extensive business interests there , and he refuses to say whether he is resident or pays taxes in the uk .
his ties with the former british colony led to a spell as its ambassador to the united nations from 1998 to 2000 .
he stepped down from the post when he was made a conservative peer , amid considerable controversy .
the tycoon had to give assurances that he would take up permanent residence in the uk .
i give the money because i support the tory principles of free markets and personal liberty lord ashcroft watchdog probes tory donor 's firm there was criticism of the peerage from within the conservative party , with former mp sir anthony grant saying : " we want to detach ourselves from this notion that people only have to give money and then they can waltz into what is , after all , part of the legislature . "
it is by no means the only controversy to have involved lord ashcroft .
his immense personal fortune has been built up through ruthless deal-making which has often shocked and unsettled the city of london .
however , even critics admit that the tycoon has a genius for making deals .
lord ashcroft made his first million at the age of 31 when he sold a cleaning company he had bought with a £ 15,000 loan five years earlier .
he then bought the hawley group , an ailing camping equipment manufacturer which he used as a vehicle to snap up a wide variety of companies .
in 1987 lord ashcroft bought the security and motor auctions group adt for £ 635m .
a decade later he sold it for £ 2.6bn , personally pocketing about £ 154m from the deal .
belize dealings lord ashcroft 's dealings in belize have also generated controversy in the past , with some politicians in the central american country having suggested an influence that has been far from healthy .
the tycoon made large donations - rumoured to total about $ 1m - to the right-wing people 's united party -lrb- pup -rrb- when it was in opposition .
in 1998 the pup came to power after defeating the centre-left united democratic party -lrb- udp -rrb- , and subsequently introduced several pieces of legislation financially advantageous to lord ashcroft .
they included a law giving tax-exempt status to some companies including his offshore holding company belize holding inc -lrb- bhi -rrb- .
the lord ashcroft-owned bank of belize was also granted the exclusive right to set up offshore companies in belize for us and uk citizens .
in an interview with a british newspaper around the time , manuel esquivel , the udp leader and belize 's former prime minister , urged uk voters to beware .
" what happened to us should be a lesson to you , " he said .
' tory principles ' lord ashcroft has been tory deputy chairman since 2005 , having previously been party treasurer from 1998 to 2001 .
as treasurer , responsible for fund-raising , mr ashcroft is said to have widened the party 's pool of donors and allowed it to recruit more staff .
the now powerful party figure is credited with devising its marginal seat strategy , pouring resources into constituencies where labour mps are defending small majorities .
he has published several books including , in 2005 , smell the coffee : a wake-up call for the conservative party .
a friend of the thatcher family , he has said that he became a donor to the party " because of my admiration for the policies of margaret thatcher " .
" i give the money because i support the tory principles of free markets and personal liberty .
and i do not seek anything for myself beyond the return of a conservative government . "
military heroes lord ashcroft settled a libel action against the times newspaper out of court in 1999 , which forms part of the subject of his book dirty politics , dirty times .
he founded the charities crimestoppers and action on addiction , and is chairman of ashcroft technology academy , in wandsworth , south-west london .
his who 's who entry list of recreations includes " researching the victoria cross " , a pastime which resulted in the book victoria cross heroes .
this was followed by last year 's sequel , special forces heroes .
he reportedly holds the largest collection of victoria crosses in private hands , comprising more than 150 of the medals .

the uk-born 62-year-old 's fortune has enabled him to pay millions of pounds in donations to the tories since the early 1980s .
he has been credited with helping to rescue the party 's finances in the past , once stepping in to personally guarantee its overdraft when it was reportedly £ 3m in the red .
but labour mps have long questioned whether donations through the uk-registered company bearwood complied with strict laws banning overseas contributions , and the electoral commission has now announced an investigation .
business genius lord ashcroft was partly brought up in belize and reportedly maintains extensive business interests there , and he refuses to say whether he is resident or pays taxes in the uk .
his ties with the former british colony led to a spell as its ambassador to the united nations from 1998 to 2000 .
he stepped down from the post when he was made a conservative peer , amid considerable controversy .
the tycoon had to give assurances that he would take up permanent residence in the uk .
i give the money because i support the tory principles of free markets and personal liberty lord ashcroft watchdog probes tory donor 's firm there was criticism of the peerage from within the conservative party , with former mp sir anthony grant saying : " we want to detach ourselves from this notion that people only have to give money and then they can waltz into what is , after all , part of the legislature . "
it is by no means the only controversy to have involved lord ashcroft .
his immense personal fortune has been built up through ruthless deal-making which has often shocked and unsettled the city of london .
however , even critics admit that the tycoon has a genius for making deals .
lord ashcroft made his first million at the age of 31 when he sold a cleaning company he had bought with a £ 15,000 loan five years earlier .
he then bought the hawley group , an ailing camping equipment manufacturer which he used as a vehicle to snap up a wide variety of companies .
in 1987 lord ashcroft bought the security and motor auctions group adt for £ 635m .
a decade later he sold it for £ 2.6bn , personally pocketing about £ 154m from the deal .
belize dealings lord ashcroft 's dealings in belize have also generated controversy in the past , with some politicians in the central american country having suggested an influence that has been far from healthy .
the tycoon made large donations - rumoured to total about $ 1m - to the right-wing people 's united party -lrb- pup -rrb- when it was in opposition .
in 1998 the pup came to power after defeating the centre-left united democratic party -lrb- udp -rrb- , and subsequently introduced several pieces of legislation financially advantageous to lord ashcroft .
they included a law giving tax-exempt status to some companies including his offshore holding company belize holding inc -lrb- bhi -rrb- .
the lord ashcroft-owned bank of belize was also granted the exclusive right to set up offshore companies in belize for us and uk citizens .
in an interview with a british newspaper around the time , manuel esquivel , the udp leader and belize 's former prime minister , urged uk voters to beware .
" what happened to us should be a lesson to you , " he said .
' tory principles ' lord ashcroft has been tory deputy chairman since 2005 , having previously been party treasurer from 1998 to 2001 .
as treasurer , responsible for fund-raising , mr ashcroft is said to have widened the party 's pool of donors and allowed it to recruit more staff .
the now powerful party figure is credited with devising its marginal seat strategy , pouring resources into constituencies where labour mps are defending small majorities .
he has published several books including , in 2005 , smell the coffee : a wake-up call for the conservative party .
a friend of the thatcher family , he has said that he became a donor to the party " because of my admiration for the policies of margaret thatcher " .
" i give the money because i support the tory principles of free markets and personal liberty .
and i do not seek anything for myself beyond the return of a conservative government . "
military heroes lord ashcroft settled a libel action against the times newspaper out of court in 1999 , which forms part of the subject of his book dirty politics , dirty times .

earlier this month facebook became the most recent site to sign up to openid , joining the board of the scheme that provides users with a single digital identity which can then be used across many websites .
microsoft and google were early adopters of the single sign-on scheme , and have since been joined by the likes of aol , yahoo , ibm and paypal .
" the idea is that just as you can use e-mail anywhere on the web to sign up for a new service , you should be able to do the same thing with an open id - but without having to create a new password , " chris messina , an open id board member told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
' reusable and durable ' mr messina , who describes himself as a " social web advocate , " said that open id would be much more convenient than the current system of individuals having to create separate accounts for each website they visit .
" would n't it be nice if you could just use these accounts over and over again without having to divulge a password ? " he said .
from bbc world service more from digital planetdownload the digital planet podcast " that would also mean you have to remember fewer passwords , and gives you more control over your online personas .
" longer term though , it is also important that people are able to establish themselves on the web in a way that is reusable and durable - so they can create connections from one place to another , and those connections go with them . "
he admitted that the risk of what would happen if open id got hacked was " a very good question " - but added that the risks in the current system are even greater .
" a lot of people on a lot of websites today require you to sign up and provide an e-mail address in the case of forgetting your password and things of that nature , so they can send you a link with a new password to access your account , " he said .
" the problem though is that , since you 're using only one or two e-mail addresses , if your e-mail gets hacked then not only can you be locked out of your e-mail account but nefarious parties could then use your e-mail to reset all of your different passwords .
" the difference here is that with open id , you 're able to choose the level of security that you might use .
this allows you to avoid being stuck in the situation where you 're giving passwords away to a number of different websites . "
different solutions it is also hoped that the open id system will reduce people 's vulnerability to phishing scams , as they will not be typing in their username and password into a fake website set up to get their personal details .
additionally , mr messina said open id will be the key to unlocking what has been termed " cloud computing " - the practice of doing traditionally desktop-based tasks , such as word processing or accounting , on the web .
" just as e-mail created the boom over the last 10 years in terms of the way people communicate , open id should lead the next wave forward in terms of collaborating online , " he said .
technology commentator bill thompson said cloud computing requires a sophisticated identification system of the type that open id offers .
however , he added that this did not automatically mean open id was the best option .
" it 's just one solution to the problem , " he said .
" there 's no guarantee open id will be the one that takes off - but at the moment it is well-placed to do so . "

earlier this month facebook became the most recent site to sign up to openid , joining the board of the scheme that provides users with a single digital identity which can then be used across many websites .
microsoft and google were early adopters of the single sign-on scheme , and have since been joined by the likes of aol , yahoo , ibm and paypal .
" the idea is that just as you can use e-mail anywhere on the web to sign up for a new service , you should be able to do the same thing with an open id - but without having to create a new password , " chris messina , an open id board member told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
' reusable and durable ' mr messina , who describes himself as a " social web advocate , " said that open id would be much more convenient than the current system of individuals having to create separate accounts for each website they visit .
" would n't it be nice if you could just use these accounts over and over again without having to divulge a password ? " he said .

" longer term though , it is also important that people are able to establish themselves on the web in a way that is reusable and durable - so they can create connections from one place to another , and those connections go with them . "
he admitted that the risk of what would happen if open id got hacked was " a very good question " - but added that the risks in the current system are even greater .
" a lot of people on a lot of websites today require you to sign up and provide an e-mail address in the case of forgetting your password and things of that nature , so they can send you a link with a new password to access your account , " he said .
" the problem though is that , since you 're using only one or two e-mail addresses , if your e-mail gets hacked then not only can you be locked out of your e-mail account but nefarious parties could then use your e-mail to reset all of your different passwords .
" the difference here is that with open id , you 're able to choose the level of security that you might use .
this allows you to avoid being stuck in the situation where you 're giving passwords away to a number of different websites . "
different solutions it is also hoped that the open id system will reduce people 's vulnerability to phishing scams , as they will not be typing in their username and password into a fake website set up to get their personal details .
facebook are now on the board of the open id scheme additionally , mr messina said open id will be the key to unlocking what has been termed " cloud computing " - the practice of doing traditionally desktop-based tasks , such as word processing or accounting , on the web .
" just as e-mail created the boom over the last 10 years in terms of the way people communicate , open id should lead the next wave forward in terms of collaborating online , " he said .
technology commentator bill thompson said cloud computing requires a sophisticated identification system of the type that open id offers .
however , he added that this did not automatically mean open id was the best option .
" it 's just one solution to the problem , " he said .
" there 's no guarantee open id will be the one that takes off - but at the moment it is well-placed to do so . "
digital planet is broadcast on bbcworld service on tuesday at 1232 gmt and repeated at 1632 gmt , 2032 gmt and on wednesday at 0032 gmt .
