nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .
they 're awaiting trial in what would be the first such prosecution in the netherlands .
the men were captured as they allegedly attacked a dutch cargo ship in january in the gulf of aden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.04.2009 german farm minister rejects pig patent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers worry about the effect on their livlihoods german agriculture minister ilse aigner has come out strongly against a european patent application for a test to check pigs for a gene that makes them produce more meat . " breeding livestock through cross-breeding and selective breeding must remain a patent-free zone , " aigner is quoted as saying in a pre-released interview with the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " it would not be acceptable for a firm to patent a genetically altered animal and afterwards demand license fees from breeders , whose animals exhibited this gene , " she said .
hundreds of people demonstrated earlier this week in front of the european union patent office in munich against the patent , which is owned by the us company , newsham choice genetics , whose initial application was approved last july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers and environmentalists have been protesting against the patent farmers , environmentalists and politicians say the patent opens the door to further commercial exploitation of bioengineering processes and undermines the livelihoods of farmers .
german states favor ban following this week 's protests , the major german farming states of bavaria and hesse have also come out in favor of a blanket ban for both plant and animal patents .
aigner also said there was " clearly room for improving current european patent law . "

zaia told reporters the option to increase food stocks to avert such threats was discussed , but a final declaration with specific measures will only be made on monday , at the end of the three-day meeting .
germany 's agriculture minister , ilse aigner , said g8 nations would push to come up with specific solutions to ensure greater food production worldwide .
these include access to land , water and strengthening " development cooperation " between rich and poor nations , she said .

the aid agency has accused industrialized nations of investing much more in their own agricultural sectors - stating an estimated $ 125 billion dollars was spent in 2008 in the form of direct payments to farmers .

baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .
in a separate incident in april , a 60-year-old man opened fire at a courthouse hearing an inheritance case in which he was entangled .
he killed his sister-in-law and wounded two others before turning the gun on himself .
a similar program was initiated following a massacre eight years ago in erfurt , when a student killed 16 people as well as himself .
unwanted firearms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has said fingerprint scanners installed on gun case locks are one safe-guard being considered according to der spiegel , hundreds of german citizens have handed over unwanted weapons in recent weeks that they either inherited or simply do n't use .
in the rems murr region alone - where winnenden , the site of the march shooting , is located - 370 weapons have been handed over to authorities since the massacre .
der spiegel also reports that a newly established taskforce in munich has collected 422 firearms , while three times as many as the average number of guns have been handed over in recent weeks in the northern city of bremen .
in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "
in the letter , rech wrote that he wanted to make use of the population 's readiness to handover dangerous firearms .
he particularly highlighted the need to fight " the unacceptable supply of illegal weapons , which we can not accurately estimate . "
the proposal was already put to the federal interior ministry and state interior ministers by rech in late march , where it was " positively received . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.04.2009 german social democrats pledge more money for low-income earners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has kicked off this year 's election season leaders of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have unanimously approved an election manifesto ahead of september 's federal poll , hoping the promise of more cash will win over voters . key points of the center-left spd 's platform are tax cuts and state handouts for low-income groups and families with children .
these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "
the spd currently trails the cdu by about eight percentage points . cg / tt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .

germany 's agriculture minister , ilse aigner , said g8 nations would push to come up with specific solutions to ensure greater food production worldwide .

the aid agency has accused industrialized nations of investing much more in their own agricultural sectors - stating an estimated $ 125 billion dollars was spent in 2008 in the form of direct payments to farmers .

baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .
in a separate incident in april , a 60-year-old man opened fire at a courthouse hearing an inheritance case in which he was entangled .
he killed his sister-in-law and wounded two others before turning the gun on himself .
a similar program was initiated following a massacre eight years ago in erfurt , when a student killed 16 people as well as himself .
unwanted firearms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has said fingerprint scanners installed on gun case locks are one safe-guard being considered according to der spiegel , hundreds of german citizens have handed over unwanted weapons in recent weeks that they either inherited or simply do n't use .
in the rems murr region alone - where winnenden , the site of the march shooting , is located - 370 weapons have been handed over to authorities since the massacre .
der spiegel also reports that a newly established taskforce in munich has collected 422 firearms , while three times as many as the average number of guns have been handed over in recent weeks in the northern city of bremen .
in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "
in the letter , rech wrote that he wanted to make use of the population 's readiness to handover dangerous firearms .
he particularly highlighted the need to fight " the unacceptable supply of illegal weapons , which we can not accurately estimate . "
the proposal was already put to the federal interior ministry and state interior ministers by rech in late march , where it was " positively received . "
federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble will meet with his state colleagues in early june for a conference , where changes to gun laws are on the agenda . cg / tt , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.04.2009 german social democrats pledge more money for low-income earners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has kicked off this year 's election season leaders of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have unanimously approved an election manifesto ahead of september 's federal poll , hoping the promise of more cash will win over voters . key points of the center-left spd 's platform are tax cuts and state handouts for low-income groups and families with children .
these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .
turn to the left ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "
the spd currently trails the cdu by about eight percentage points . cg / tt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy 's agriculture minister , luca zaia , whose country currently holds the g8 presidency , said all members agree " something must be done " to safeguard food supplies threatened by sudden price hikes and speculation .
zaia told reporters the option to increase food stocks to avert such threats was discussed , but a final declaration with specific measures will only be made on monday , at the end of the three-day meeting .
germany 's agriculture minister , ilse aigner , said g8 nations would push to come up with specific solutions to ensure greater food production worldwide .
these include access to land , water and strengthening " development cooperation " between rich and poor nations , she said .
food prices on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food riots in haiti turned deadly in 2008 the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- has warned that 2009 could see large spikes in world food prices - similar to those in 2008 that triggered food riots in dozens of countries .
a policy document prepared ahead of the talks mentioned calls for " immediate interventions " - aimed at doubling global agriculture production by 2050 .
ahead of the summit , however , zaia all but ruled out upfront financial aid .
" if you ask me whether we will come up with a package for agriculture at the end ?
no , it is not our competence , " he said .
the g8 ministers met on saturday evening with delegates from the so-called g5 emerging economies of brazil , india , mexico , china , as well as those from argentina , egypt and mexico .
the aim of this meeting is to draw up a document to be put to g8 leaders at their next summit in july .

in a document handed out to summit delegates , oxfam noted that agriculture aid , which represented some 18 percent of development assistance in the eighties , was down to only 4 percent in 2007 , totaling just under $ 6 billion .
the aid agency has accused industrialized nations of investing much more in their own agricultural sectors - stating an estimated $ 125 billion dollars was spent in 2008 in the form of direct payments to farmers .
the meeting has " an important role to play and we hope the concrete decisions will be taken -lrb- especially -rrb- in support of investment in developing countries , " said chris leather from oxfam . cg / tt , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

" the global challenge to reduce food emergency " is the title of the report the agriculture ministers of the g8 nations - that is , the us , canada , russia , japan , britain , france , germany and italy - were given ahead of their meetings with ministers from the g5 -lrb- brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa -rrb- . starting saturday in the town of cison di valmarino , near treviso in northeastern italy , that combined group of leaders will begin confronting the global challenge , determined to prove that the world does have the means to feed its hungry millions . since food prices skyrocketed in 2008 , leading to riots and panic buying in some regions , the world has sought to boost farm output and food reserve stocks . some nations , such as india , instituted tight export controls on staples like wheat and rice .
others , like south korea and saudi arabia , have bought land overseas to help grow food for their populations . prices have dropped off since last year but experts warn that they could take off again once the world economy starts recovering . looking ahead the summit , which runs through monday , aims to put in place some concrete proposals on food security that could be presented to g8 leaders at their summit in la maddalena , sardinia in july . among them is a proposed global grain reserve , meant to stabilize food supply in times of crisis and avoid price shocks , but details have yet to be worked out . in addition to g8 and g5 leaders , agricultural ministers from argentina , australia and egypt are expected at the talks , along with representatives from the african union , the world bank and other international institutions . mrh / mr , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

bayern munich stay in the title race with a win over arminia bielefeld , and a hat-trick from mario gomez fires stuttgart over cologne . wolfsburg 's 2-1 win over bayer leverkusen marked the 10th straight win for felix magath 's table-topping squad .
that 's the longest winning streak the bundesliga has seen since borussia moenchengladbach did the same in the 1986-1987 season . " it 's not normal and it 's not something that you will necessarily experience again , " said magath of his team 's winning streak .
" we 've got to take this experience for what it 's worth and be thankful for what we 've accomplished , but nothing more than that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's felix magath has led his team to 10 straight wins brazilian striker grafite scored both goals to keep wolfsburg 's hopes for their first bundesliga title alive .
the first came on a penalty kick in the 23rd minute .
leverkusen 's toni kroos scored the equalizer nine minutes into the second half . as the end of the game approached , it looked as if leverkusen might escape with a point .
but grafite landed the game-winner five minutes before the end to extend wolfsburg 's winning streak . the final goal was grafite 's 22nd on the season - he now leads all scorers in the bundesliga . bayern still alive bayern munich stay close on wolfsburg 's heels despite only managing one goal at 15th-placed arminia bielefeld .
the game was scoreless until the 65th minute when luca toni headed in a corner from franck ribery . bayern is still three points behind wolfsburg in the table with six games left to play . " that 's 18 points , " said bayern 's coach juergen klinsmann of the final six games .
" maybe we wo n't get them all , but we 'll try to stay with -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- and hopefully , sooner or later , pull ahead of them . " of the six remaining matches , four are home games for klinsmann 's team . hat-trick for gomez bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and stuttgart have had much to celebrate lately stuttgart continued to climb up the table and were led by three goals from striker mario gomez against cologne .
gomez headed the first goal home in the 16th minute and found the back of the net again in the 55th and 71st minutes , propelling him up to second on the bundesliga 's top scorer 's list .
cologne were unable to capitalize on several scoring opportunities to avoid the 3-0 shutout . the win moves stuttgart into a tie for third place with hamburg , with both teams on 51 points , but hamburg play sunday against hanover 96 .
stuttgart trail wolfsburg by six points . with stuttgart flirting with a spot in next year 's champions league , the battle for the remaining international spots remains intense . borussia dortmund got a win on the road against bochum , thanks to a first half header from patrick owomoyela and a blast from outside the box in the second half from nelson valdez .
dortmund trail fifth place hertha berlin by three points with 46 and are tied with schalke 04 , who clobbered energie cottbus 4-0 on friday .
berlin host werder bremen on sunday . no improvement for hoffenheim still no good news this year for hoffenheim , who were on the road against last place karlsruhe .
the match-up was a clash of the bundesliga 's two worst teams of 2009 : hoffenheim have n't won a game in ten tries , and karlsruhe have only scored four goals since the start of the second half . although the single point gained from the 2-2 draw is little consolation for hoffenheim , there was a bright spot for karlsruhe as sebastian freis ' goal in the 33rd minutes snapped an eight game skid of scoreless games . sejad salihovic put hoffenheim on the board first in the 28th minute and set up the second goal for selim teber just after the break .
but giovanni federico earned karlsruhe an equalizer midway through the second half to save the point . relegation looms large for the struggling borussia moenchengladbach , and saturday 's 4-1 loss to eintracht frankfurt did not help their chances of remaining in the top flight .

he said he did n't have the impression that the director was looking to generate headlines , or that he was denouncing one side or the other in the middle east conflict . knabe 's production is due to open on may 2 . gb / ncy , dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

bayern munich stay in the title race with a win over arminia bielefeld , and a hat-trick from mario gomez fires stuttgart over cologne . wolfsburg 's 2-1 win over bayer leverkusen marked the 10th straight win for felix magath 's table-topping squad .
that 's the longest winning streak the bundesliga has seen since borussia moenchengladbach did the same in the 1986-1987 season . " it 's not normal and it 's not something that you will necessarily experience again , " said magath of his team 's winning streak .
" we 've got to take this experience for what it 's worth and be thankful for what we 've accomplished , but nothing more than that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's felix magath has led his team to 10 straight wins brazilian striker grafite scored both goals to keep wolfsburg 's hopes for their first bundesliga title alive .
the first came on a penalty kick in the 23rd minute .
leverkusen 's toni kroos scored the equalizer nine minutes into the second half . as the end of the game approached , it looked as if leverkusen might escape with a point .
but grafite landed the game-winner five minutes before the end to extend wolfsburg 's winning streak . the final goal was grafite 's 22nd on the season - he now leads all scorers in the bundesliga . bayern still alive bayern munich stay close on wolfsburg 's heels despite only managing one goal at 15th-placed arminia bielefeld .
the game was scoreless until the 65th minute when luca toni headed in a corner from franck ribery . bayern is still three points behind wolfsburg in the table with six games left to play . " that 's 18 points , " said bayern 's coach juergen klinsmann of the final six games .
" maybe we wo n't get them all , but we 'll try to stay with -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- and hopefully , sooner or later , pull ahead of them . " of the six remaining matches , four are home games for klinsmann 's team . hat-trick for gomez bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and stuttgart have had much to celebrate lately stuttgart continued to climb up the table and were led by three goals from striker mario gomez against cologne .
gomez headed the first goal home in the 16th minute and found the back of the net again in the 55th and 71st minutes , propelling him up to second on the bundesliga 's top scorer 's list .
cologne were unable to capitalize on several scoring opportunities to avoid the 3-0 shutout . the win moves stuttgart into a tie for third place with hamburg , with both teams on 51 points , but hamburg play sunday against hanover 96 .
stuttgart trail wolfsburg by six points . with stuttgart flirting with a spot in next year 's champions league , the battle for the remaining international spots remains intense . borussia dortmund got a win on the road against bochum , thanks to a first half header from patrick owomoyela and a blast from outside the box in the second half from nelson valdez .
dortmund trail fifth place hertha berlin by three points with 46 and are tied with schalke 04 , who clobbered energie cottbus 4-0 on friday .
berlin host werder bremen on sunday . no improvement for hoffenheim still no good news this year for hoffenheim , who were on the road against last place karlsruhe .
the match-up was a clash of the bundesliga 's two worst teams of 2009 : hoffenheim have n't won a game in ten tries , and karlsruhe have only scored four goals since the start of the second half . although the single point gained from the 2-2 draw is little consolation for hoffenheim , there was a bright spot for karlsruhe as sebastian freis ' goal in the 33rd minutes snapped an eight game skid of scoreless games . sejad salihovic put hoffenheim on the board first in the 28th minute and set up the second goal for selim teber just after the break .
but giovanni federico earned karlsruhe an equalizer midway through the second half to save the point . relegation looms large for the struggling borussia moenchengladbach , and saturday 's 4-1 loss to eintracht frankfurt did not help their chances of remaining in the top flight .

gomez headed the first goal home in the 16th minute and found the back of the net again in the 55th and 71st minutes , propelling him up to second on the bundesliga 's top scorer 's list .

berlin host werder bremen on sunday . no improvement for hoffenheim still no good news this year for hoffenheim , who were on the road against last place karlsruhe .
the match-up was a clash of the bundesliga 's two worst teams of 2009 : hoffenheim have n't won a game in ten tries , and karlsruhe have only scored four goals since the start of the second half . although the single point gained from the 2-2 draw is little consolation for hoffenheim , there was a bright spot for karlsruhe as sebastian freis ' goal in the 33rd minutes snapped an eight game skid of scoreless games . sejad salihovic put hoffenheim on the board first in the 28th minute and set up the second goal for selim teber just after the break .
but giovanni federico earned karlsruhe an equalizer midway through the second half to save the point . relegation looms large for the struggling borussia moenchengladbach , and saturday 's 4-1 loss to eintracht frankfurt did not help their chances of remaining in the top flight .

" breeding livestock through cross-breeding and selective breeding must remain a patent-free zone , " aigner is quoted as saying in a pre-released interview with the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " it would not be acceptable for a firm to patent a genetically altered animal and afterwards demand license fees from breeders , whose animals exhibited this gene , " she said .
hundreds of people demonstrated earlier this week in front of the european union patent office in munich against the patent , which is owned by the us company , newsham choice genetics , whose initial application was approved last july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers and environmentalists have been protesting against the patent farmers , environmentalists and politicians say the patent opens the door to further commercial exploitation of bioengineering processes and undermines the livelihoods of farmers .
german states favor ban following this week 's protests , the major german farming states of bavaria and hesse have also come out in favor of a blanket ban for both plant and animal patents .
aigner also said there was " clearly room for improving current european patent law . "
germany is the world 's fourth largest meat producer and almost a quarter of the european union 's pork is raised in the country .
pork also plays a key role in the german diet - from sausages and cold cuts , to ham hocks and hearty roasts .
christoph then , a patent expert with greenpeace , said his organization feared that a growing monopolization of animal and plant breeding would lead to a small number of companies dominating the market and dictating prices .

nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .
they 're awaiting trial in what would be the first such prosecution in the netherlands .
the men were captured as they allegedly attacked a dutch cargo ship in january in the gulf of aden .

regional analysts and security experts say that without political stability in somalia , which has been mired in conflict for 18 years , the pirate gangs will continue to thrive .
most of somalia 's pirate gangs operate from the semi-autonomous northern region of puntland , where many of them say they first took to the seas to stop illegal fishing by european fleets and the dumping of toxic waste .

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

bayern munich stay in the title race with a win over arminia bielefeld , and a hat-trick from mario gomez fires stuttgart over cologne . wolfsburg 's 2-1 win over bayer leverkusen marked the 10th straight win for felix magath 's table-topping squad .
that 's the longest winning streak the bundesliga has seen since borussia moenchengladbach did the same in the 1986-1987 season . " it 's not normal and it 's not something that you will necessarily experience again , " said magath of his team 's winning streak .
" we 've got to take this experience for what it 's worth and be thankful for what we 've accomplished , but nothing more than that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's felix magath has led his team to 10 straight wins brazilian striker grafite scored both goals to keep wolfsburg 's hopes for their first bundesliga title alive .
the first came on a penalty kick in the 23rd minute .
leverkusen 's toni kroos scored the equalizer nine minutes into the second half . as the end of the game approached , it looked as if leverkusen might escape with a point .
but grafite landed the game-winner five minutes before the end to extend wolfsburg 's winning streak . the final goal was grafite 's 22nd on the season - he now leads all scorers in the bundesliga . bayern still alive bayern munich stay close on wolfsburg 's heels despite only managing one goal at 15th-placed arminia bielefeld .
the game was scoreless until the 65th minute when luca toni headed in a corner from franck ribery . bayern is still three points behind wolfsburg in the table with six games left to play . " that 's 18 points , " said bayern 's coach juergen klinsmann of the final six games .
" maybe we wo n't get them all , but we 'll try to stay with -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- and hopefully , sooner or later , pull ahead of them . " of the six remaining matches , four are home games for klinsmann 's team . hat-trick for gomez bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and stuttgart have had much to celebrate lately stuttgart continued to climb up the table and were led by three goals from striker mario gomez against cologne .
gomez headed the first goal home in the 16th minute and found the back of the net again in the 55th and 71st minutes , propelling him up to second on the bundesliga 's top scorer 's list .
cologne were unable to capitalize on several scoring opportunities to avoid the 3-0 shutout . the win moves stuttgart into a tie for third place with hamburg , with both teams on 51 points , but hamburg play sunday against hanover 96 .
stuttgart trail wolfsburg by six points . with stuttgart flirting with a spot in next year 's champions league , the battle for the remaining international spots remains intense . borussia dortmund got a win on the road against bochum , thanks to a first half header from patrick owomoyela and a blast from outside the box in the second half from nelson valdez .
dortmund trail fifth place hertha berlin by three points with 46 and are tied with schalke 04 , who clobbered energie cottbus 4-0 on friday .
berlin host werder bremen on sunday . no improvement for hoffenheim still no good news this year for hoffenheim , who were on the road against last place karlsruhe .
the match-up was a clash of the bundesliga 's two worst teams of 2009 : hoffenheim have n't won a game in ten tries , and karlsruhe have only scored four goals since the start of the second half . although the single point gained from the 2-2 draw is little consolation for hoffenheim , there was a bright spot for karlsruhe as sebastian freis ' goal in the 33rd minutes snapped an eight game skid of scoreless games . sejad salihovic put hoffenheim on the board first in the 28th minute and set up the second goal for selim teber just after the break .
but giovanni federico earned karlsruhe an equalizer midway through the second half to save the point . relegation looms large for the struggling borussia moenchengladbach , and saturday 's 4-1 loss to eintracht frankfurt did not help their chances of remaining in the top flight .

nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .
they 're awaiting trial in what would be the first such prosecution in the netherlands .
the men were captured as they allegedly attacked a dutch cargo ship in january in the gulf of aden .
belgian ship feared hijacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch nato forces are currently patrolling the waters in the gulf of aden meanwhile a belgian-registered ship with a 10-member international crew is suspected to have been hijacked by somali pirates .
" we have hijacked a belgian ship , " an unnamed pirate source told reuters in mogadischu by satellite telephone .
" we will take it to haradheere , " he said , referring to a port located on the cost of central somalia .
a spokesman from the belgian government crisis center said the ship - identified as the dredging vessel , the pompei - sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
authorities have not been able to make contact with it since , and satellite pictures showed that the ship was not moving .
an emergency meeting between senior government and shipping officials has been convened in brussels .
a question of political stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama says his country will also up efforts to reduce piracy somali pirates have already attacked more than 80 boats this year , while 15 cargo ships and nearly 300 crew members are currently being held hostage .
regional analysts and security experts say that without political stability in somalia , which has been mired in conflict for 18 years , the pirate gangs will continue to thrive .
most of somalia 's pirate gangs operate from the semi-autonomous northern region of puntland , where many of them say they first took to the seas to stop illegal fishing by european fleets and the dumping of toxic waste .
the somali government plans to present its proposals to combat the sea gangs at a somali donors ' meeting in brussels next week . cg / tt , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .

"
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german states -pipe- 18.04.2009 german state proposes gun amnesty after school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following march 's shooting , hundreds of germans have voluntarily handed in firearms a southern german state - the scene of a deadly school shooting in march - is proposing amnesty for people who hand in illegal firearms . according to a report to be published on monday , april 20 , in the german weekly der spiegel , weapons turned in to authorities in the state of baden-wuerttemberg would be accepted with no questions asked - provided they have not been previously been used to commit a crime .
baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .
in a separate incident in april , a 60-year-old man opened fire at a courthouse hearing an inheritance case in which he was entangled .
he killed his sister-in-law and wounded two others before turning the gun on himself .
a similar program was initiated following a massacre eight years ago in erfurt , when a student killed 16 people as well as himself .
unwanted firearms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has said fingerprint scanners installed on gun case locks are one safe-guard being considered according to der spiegel , hundreds of german citizens have handed over unwanted weapons in recent weeks that they either inherited or simply do n't use .
in the rems murr region alone - where winnenden , the site of the march shooting , is located - 370 weapons have been handed over to authorities since the massacre .
der spiegel also reports that a newly established taskforce in munich has collected 422 firearms , while three times as many as the average number of guns have been handed over in recent weeks in the northern city of bremen .
in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "
in the letter , rech wrote that he wanted to make use of the population 's readiness to handover dangerous firearms .
he particularly highlighted the need to fight " the unacceptable supply of illegal weapons , which we can not accurately estimate . "
the proposal was already put to the federal interior ministry and state interior ministers by rech in late march , where it was " positively received . "
federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble will meet with his state colleagues in early june for a conference , where changes to gun laws are on the agenda . cg / tt , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .

"
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .

bayern munich stay in the title race with a win over arminia bielefeld , and a hat-trick from mario gomez fires stuttgart over cologne . wolfsburg 's 2-1 win over bayer leverkusen marked the 10th straight win for felix magath 's table-topping squad .
that 's the longest winning streak the bundesliga has seen since borussia moenchengladbach did the same in the 1986-1987 season . " it 's not normal and it 's not something that you will necessarily experience again , " said magath of his team 's winning streak .
" we 've got to take this experience for what it 's worth and be thankful for what we 've accomplished , but nothing more than that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's felix magath has led his team to 10 straight wins brazilian striker grafite scored both goals to keep wolfsburg 's hopes for their first bundesliga title alive .
the first came on a penalty kick in the 23rd minute .
leverkusen 's toni kroos scored the equalizer nine minutes into the second half . as the end of the game approached , it looked as if leverkusen might escape with a point .
but grafite landed the game-winner five minutes before the end to extend wolfsburg 's winning streak . the final goal was grafite 's 22nd on the season - he now leads all scorers in the bundesliga . bayern still alive bayern munich stay close on wolfsburg 's heels despite only managing one goal at 15th-placed arminia bielefeld .
the game was scoreless until the 65th minute when luca toni headed in a corner from franck ribery . bayern is still three points behind wolfsburg in the table with six games left to play . " that 's 18 points , " said bayern 's coach juergen klinsmann of the final six games .
" maybe we wo n't get them all , but we 'll try to stay with -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- and hopefully , sooner or later , pull ahead of them . " of the six remaining matches , four are home games for klinsmann 's team . hat-trick for gomez bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and stuttgart have had much to celebrate lately stuttgart continued to climb up the table and were led by three goals from striker mario gomez against cologne .
gomez headed the first goal home in the 16th minute and found the back of the net again in the 55th and 71st minutes , propelling him up to second on the bundesliga 's top scorer 's list .
cologne were unable to capitalize on several scoring opportunities to avoid the 3-0 shutout . the win moves stuttgart into a tie for third place with hamburg , with both teams on 51 points , but hamburg play sunday against hanover 96 .
stuttgart trail wolfsburg by six points . with stuttgart flirting with a spot in next year 's champions league , the battle for the remaining international spots remains intense . borussia dortmund got a win on the road against bochum , thanks to a first half header from patrick owomoyela and a blast from outside the box in the second half from nelson valdez .
dortmund trail fifth place hertha berlin by three points with 46 and are tied with schalke 04 , who clobbered energie cottbus 4-0 on friday .
berlin host werder bremen on sunday . no improvement for hoffenheim still no good news this year for hoffenheim , who were on the road against last place karlsruhe .
the match-up was a clash of the bundesliga 's two worst teams of 2009 : hoffenheim have n't won a game in ten tries , and karlsruhe have only scored four goals since the start of the second half . although the single point gained from the 2-2 draw is little consolation for hoffenheim , there was a bright spot for karlsruhe as sebastian freis ' goal in the 33rd minutes snapped an eight game skid of scoreless games . sejad salihovic put hoffenheim on the board first in the 28th minute and set up the second goal for selim teber just after the break .
but giovanni federico earned karlsruhe an equalizer midway through the second half to save the point . relegation looms large for the struggling borussia moenchengladbach , and saturday 's 4-1 loss to eintracht frankfurt did not help their chances of remaining in the top flight .

baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .

he particularly highlighted the need to fight " the unacceptable supply of illegal weapons , which we can not accurately estimate . "
the proposal was already put to the federal interior ministry and state interior ministers by rech in late march , where it was " positively received . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's felix magath has led his team to 10 straight wins brazilian striker grafite scored both goals to keep wolfsburg 's hopes for their first bundesliga title alive .
the first came on a penalty kick in the 23rd minute .

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .
turn to the left ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "
the spd currently trails the cdu by about eight percentage points . cg / tt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .
they 're awaiting trial in what would be the first such prosecution in the netherlands .
the men were captured as they allegedly attacked a dutch cargo ship in january in the gulf of aden .
belgian ship feared hijacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch nato forces are currently patrolling the waters in the gulf of aden meanwhile a belgian-registered ship with a 10-member international crew is suspected to have been hijacked by somali pirates .
" we have hijacked a belgian ship , " an unnamed pirate source told reuters in mogadischu by satellite telephone .
" we will take it to haradheere , " he said , referring to a port located on the cost of central somalia .
a spokesman from the belgian government crisis center said the ship - identified as the dredging vessel , the pompei - sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
authorities have not been able to make contact with it since , and satellite pictures showed that the ship was not moving .
an emergency meeting between senior government and shipping officials has been convened in brussels .
a question of political stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama says his country will also up efforts to reduce piracy somali pirates have already attacked more than 80 boats this year , while 15 cargo ships and nearly 300 crew members are currently being held hostage .
regional analysts and security experts say that without political stability in somalia , which has been mired in conflict for 18 years , the pirate gangs will continue to thrive .

this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .

the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .

bayern munich stay in the title race with a win over arminia bielefeld , and a hat-trick from mario gomez fires stuttgart over cologne . wolfsburg 's 2-1 win over bayer leverkusen marked the 10th straight win for felix magath 's table-topping squad .
that 's the longest winning streak the bundesliga has seen since borussia moenchengladbach did the same in the 1986-1987 season . " it 's not normal and it 's not something that you will necessarily experience again , " said magath of his team 's winning streak .
" we 've got to take this experience for what it 's worth and be thankful for what we 've accomplished , but nothing more than that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's felix magath has led his team to 10 straight wins brazilian striker grafite scored both goals to keep wolfsburg 's hopes for their first bundesliga title alive .
the first came on a penalty kick in the 23rd minute .
leverkusen 's toni kroos scored the equalizer nine minutes into the second half . as the end of the game approached , it looked as if leverkusen might escape with a point .
but grafite landed the game-winner five minutes before the end to extend wolfsburg 's winning streak . the final goal was grafite 's 22nd on the season - he now leads all scorers in the bundesliga . bayern still alive bayern munich stay close on wolfsburg 's heels despite only managing one goal at 15th-placed arminia bielefeld .
the game was scoreless until the 65th minute when luca toni headed in a corner from franck ribery . bayern is still three points behind wolfsburg in the table with six games left to play . " that 's 18 points , " said bayern 's coach juergen klinsmann of the final six games .
" maybe we wo n't get them all , but we 'll try to stay with -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- and hopefully , sooner or later , pull ahead of them . " of the six remaining matches , four are home games for klinsmann 's team . hat-trick for gomez bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and stuttgart have had much to celebrate lately stuttgart continued to climb up the table and were led by three goals from striker mario gomez against cologne .
gomez headed the first goal home in the 16th minute and found the back of the net again in the 55th and 71st minutes , propelling him up to second on the bundesliga 's top scorer 's list .
cologne were unable to capitalize on several scoring opportunities to avoid the 3-0 shutout . the win moves stuttgart into a tie for third place with hamburg , with both teams on 51 points , but hamburg play sunday against hanover 96 .
stuttgart trail wolfsburg by six points . with stuttgart flirting with a spot in next year 's champions league , the battle for the remaining international spots remains intense . borussia dortmund got a win on the road against bochum , thanks to a first half header from patrick owomoyela and a blast from outside the box in the second half from nelson valdez .
dortmund trail fifth place hertha berlin by three points with 46 and are tied with schalke 04 , who clobbered energie cottbus 4-0 on friday .
berlin host werder bremen on sunday . no improvement for hoffenheim still no good news this year for hoffenheim , who were on the road against last place karlsruhe .
the match-up was a clash of the bundesliga 's two worst teams of 2009 : hoffenheim have n't won a game in ten tries , and karlsruhe have only scored four goals since the start of the second half . although the single point gained from the 2-2 draw is little consolation for hoffenheim , there was a bright spot for karlsruhe as sebastian freis ' goal in the 33rd minutes snapped an eight game skid of scoreless games . sejad salihovic put hoffenheim on the board first in the 28th minute and set up the second goal for selim teber just after the break .
but giovanni federico earned karlsruhe an equalizer midway through the second half to save the point . relegation looms large for the struggling borussia moenchengladbach , and saturday 's 4-1 loss to eintracht frankfurt did not help their chances of remaining in the top flight .

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

obama also presented a new 30-million-dollar -lrb- 23-million-euro -rrb- initiative to fight drug trafficking and boost cooperation on security issues . gb / ncy , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the staging includes a bloody machinegun battle and a gang rape . scenes too drastic to stomach , actors say german media reports quote a spokeswoman for the chorus as saying that rehearsing these drastic scenes had been psychologically unbearable and had made many of the chorus members physically ill . apparently some people were n't accustomed to this sort of thing , said wunderlich , adding that other theaters were doing more shocking things , like the production of macbeth in duesseldorf , where actors throw real feces around the stage . wunderlich said the chorus still had enough people to perform and that some of the singers had even praised knabe 's work .
he said he did n't have the impression that the director was looking to generate headlines , or that he was denouncing one side or the other in the middle east conflict . knabe 's production is due to open on may 2 . gb / ncy , dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.04.2009 german farm minister rejects pig patent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers worry about the effect on their livlihoods german agriculture minister ilse aigner has come out strongly against a european patent application for a test to check pigs for a gene that makes them produce more meat . " breeding livestock through cross-breeding and selective breeding must remain a patent-free zone , " aigner is quoted as saying in a pre-released interview with the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " it would not be acceptable for a firm to patent a genetically altered animal and afterwards demand license fees from breeders , whose animals exhibited this gene , " she said .
hundreds of people demonstrated earlier this week in front of the european union patent office in munich against the patent , which is owned by the us company , newsham choice genetics , whose initial application was approved last july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers and environmentalists have been protesting against the patent farmers , environmentalists and politicians say the patent opens the door to further commercial exploitation of bioengineering processes and undermines the livelihoods of farmers .
german states favor ban following this week 's protests , the major german farming states of bavaria and hesse have also come out in favor of a blanket ban for both plant and animal patents .
aigner also said there was " clearly room for improving current european patent law . "
germany is the world 's fourth largest meat producer and almost a quarter of the european union 's pork is raised in the country .
pork also plays a key role in the german diet - from sausages and cold cuts , to ham hocks and hearty roasts .

" breeding livestock through cross-breeding and selective breeding must remain a patent-free zone , " aigner is quoted as saying in a pre-released interview with the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " it would not be acceptable for a firm to patent a genetically altered animal and afterwards demand license fees from breeders , whose animals exhibited this gene , " she said .
hundreds of people demonstrated earlier this week in front of the european union patent office in munich against the patent , which is owned by the us company , newsham choice genetics , whose initial application was approved last july .

aigner also said there was " clearly room for improving current european patent law . "

nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .
they 're awaiting trial in what would be the first such prosecution in the netherlands .
the men were captured as they allegedly attacked a dutch cargo ship in january in the gulf of aden .
belgian ship feared hijacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch nato forces are currently patrolling the waters in the gulf of aden meanwhile a belgian-registered ship with a 10-member international crew is suspected to have been hijacked by somali pirates .
" we have hijacked a belgian ship , " an unnamed pirate source told reuters in mogadischu by satellite telephone .
" we will take it to haradheere , " he said , referring to a port located on the cost of central somalia .

these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "

these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german states -pipe- 18.04.2009 german state proposes gun amnesty after school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following march 's shooting , hundreds of germans have voluntarily handed in firearms a southern german state - the scene of a deadly school shooting in march - is proposing amnesty for people who hand in illegal firearms . according to a report to be published on monday , april 20 , in the german weekly der spiegel , weapons turned in to authorities in the state of baden-wuerttemberg would be accepted with no questions asked - provided they have not been previously been used to commit a crime .
baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .
in a separate incident in april , a 60-year-old man opened fire at a courthouse hearing an inheritance case in which he was entangled .
he killed his sister-in-law and wounded two others before turning the gun on himself .
a similar program was initiated following a massacre eight years ago in erfurt , when a student killed 16 people as well as himself .
unwanted firearms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has said fingerprint scanners installed on gun case locks are one safe-guard being considered according to der spiegel , hundreds of german citizens have handed over unwanted weapons in recent weeks that they either inherited or simply do n't use .
in the rems murr region alone - where winnenden , the site of the march shooting , is located - 370 weapons have been handed over to authorities since the massacre .
der spiegel also reports that a newly established taskforce in munich has collected 422 firearms , while three times as many as the average number of guns have been handed over in recent weeks in the northern city of bremen .
in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "
in the letter , rech wrote that he wanted to make use of the population 's readiness to handover dangerous firearms .

baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .
in a separate incident in april , a 60-year-old man opened fire at a courthouse hearing an inheritance case in which he was entangled .

in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "

obama also presented a new 30-million-dollar -lrb- 23-million-euro -rrb- initiative to fight drug trafficking and boost cooperation on security issues . gb / ncy , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.04.2009 german social democrats pledge more money for low-income earners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has kicked off this year 's election season leaders of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have unanimously approved an election manifesto ahead of september 's federal poll , hoping the promise of more cash will win over voters . key points of the center-left spd 's platform are tax cuts and state handouts for low-income groups and families with children .
these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .
turn to the left ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "
the spd currently trails the cdu by about eight percentage points . cg / tt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .
they 're awaiting trial in what would be the first such prosecution in the netherlands .
the men were captured as they allegedly attacked a dutch cargo ship in january in the gulf of aden .
belgian ship feared hijacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch nato forces are currently patrolling the waters in the gulf of aden meanwhile a belgian-registered ship with a 10-member international crew is suspected to have been hijacked by somali pirates .
" we have hijacked a belgian ship , " an unnamed pirate source told reuters in mogadischu by satellite telephone .
" we will take it to haradheere , " he said , referring to a port located on the cost of central somalia .
a spokesman from the belgian government crisis center said the ship - identified as the dredging vessel , the pompei - sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
authorities have not been able to make contact with it since , and satellite pictures showed that the ship was not moving .
an emergency meeting between senior government and shipping officials has been convened in brussels .
a question of political stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama says his country will also up efforts to reduce piracy somali pirates have already attacked more than 80 boats this year , while 15 cargo ships and nearly 300 crew members are currently being held hostage .
regional analysts and security experts say that without political stability in somalia , which has been mired in conflict for 18 years , the pirate gangs will continue to thrive .
most of somalia 's pirate gangs operate from the semi-autonomous northern region of puntland , where many of them say they first took to the seas to stop illegal fishing by european fleets and the dumping of toxic waste .
the somali government plans to present its proposals to combat the sea gangs at a somali donors ' meeting in brussels next week . cg / tt , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

" breeding livestock through cross-breeding and selective breeding must remain a patent-free zone , " aigner is quoted as saying in a pre-released interview with the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " it would not be acceptable for a firm to patent a genetically altered animal and afterwards demand license fees from breeders , whose animals exhibited this gene , " she said .
hundreds of people demonstrated earlier this week in front of the european union patent office in munich against the patent , which is owned by the us company , newsham choice genetics , whose initial application was approved last july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers and environmentalists have been protesting against the patent farmers , environmentalists and politicians say the patent opens the door to further commercial exploitation of bioengineering processes and undermines the livelihoods of farmers .
german states favor ban following this week 's protests , the major german farming states of bavaria and hesse have also come out in favor of a blanket ban for both plant and animal patents .
aigner also said there was " clearly room for improving current european patent law . "
germany is the world 's fourth largest meat producer and almost a quarter of the european union 's pork is raised in the country .
pork also plays a key role in the german diet - from sausages and cold cuts , to ham hocks and hearty roasts .
christoph then , a patent expert with greenpeace , said his organization feared that a growing monopolization of animal and plant breeding would lead to a small number of companies dominating the market and dictating prices .
not really genetic technology ?
the newsham pig testing kit was originally developed by us biotech company , monsanto , which was recently in the news after germany banned the use of its genetically modified corn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german culinary highlight : stuffed pork stomach with mashed potatoes the kit allows farmers to identify a particular gene in pigs that yields robust animals with body fat and meat proportions sought by the pork industry .

nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .

nato lieutenant commander alexandre fernandes said the dutch ship chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " - a yemeni fishing dhow that 's believed to have been hijacked last thursday .
" we have freed the hostages , we have freed the dhow and we have seized the weapons , " fernandes said .
" the pirates did not fight and no gunfire was exchanged . "
fernandes said the commandos briefly detained the seven gunmen for questioning , but could not confirm that they had been arrested .
" nato does not have a detainment policy , " he said .
" the warship must follow its national law . "
" they can only arrest them if the pirates are from the netherlands , the victims are from the netherlands , or if they are in netherlands waters . "
dutch authorities already have five somali pirates in custody .
they 're awaiting trial in what would be the first such prosecution in the netherlands .
the men were captured as they allegedly attacked a dutch cargo ship in january in the gulf of aden .
belgian ship feared hijacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch nato forces are currently patrolling the waters in the gulf of aden meanwhile a belgian-registered ship with a 10-member international crew is suspected to have been hijacked by somali pirates .
" we have hijacked a belgian ship , " an unnamed pirate source told reuters in mogadischu by satellite telephone .
" we will take it to haradheere , " he said , referring to a port located on the cost of central somalia .
a spokesman from the belgian government crisis center said the ship - identified as the dredging vessel , the pompei - sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
authorities have not been able to make contact with it since , and satellite pictures showed that the ship was not moving .
an emergency meeting between senior government and shipping officials has been convened in brussels .
a question of political stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama says his country will also up efforts to reduce piracy somali pirates have already attacked more than 80 boats this year , while 15 cargo ships and nearly 300 crew members are currently being held hostage .
regional analysts and security experts say that without political stability in somalia , which has been mired in conflict for 18 years , the pirate gangs will continue to thrive .
most of somalia 's pirate gangs operate from the semi-autonomous northern region of puntland , where many of them say they first took to the seas to stop illegal fishing by european fleets and the dumping of toxic waste .
the somali government plans to present its proposals to combat the sea gangs at a somali donors ' meeting in brussels next week . cg / tt , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have now begun referring to bagram as " obama 's guantanamo . "
an estimated 650 inmates are being held at the prison north of kabul , but the public rarely receives any details about how they 're being treated , says german green party politician and afghanistan expert , winfried nachtwei .
" up until now , i think it 's only fair to describe bagram as a black hole , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was applauded for vowing to close guantanamo aside from red cross officials , no outsiders are allowed to visit the prison , of which there are also no public photos .
only prison personnel and former inmates know for sure exactly what goes on at bagram .
several thousand prisoners have passed through the compound in recent years , according to ferdinand muggenthaler of amnesty international .
" in the initial period especially there were many reports of torture and mistreatment at bagram , " he said .
" we know that prisoners were hung by chains from their hands , that they were deprived of sleep , and that they were locked up together in small cells in impossible conditions .
and there were at least two deaths in which several soldiers were convicted , although their sentences were laughable . "
the us government has defended its policy on bagram , saying the prison is located in a war zone , and american law therefore does n't apply .
unlike prisoners in guantanamo , bagram inmates have previously been unable to challenge their detention in us courts - an untenable situation , says muggenthaler .
" the prisoners in bagram must get access to proper judicial procedures , " the amnesty international representative said .
" they have to be able to challenge their detention in the us and only be detained if they are convicted during a proper court procedure . "
glimpse of hope in court ruling but in what could become a historic decision , a us federal judge recently ruled that non-afghan citizens rendered by the us to bagram have a constitutional right to challenge their detention in us civilian courts .
judge john bates ruled that the cases of three bagram detainees are " virtually identical " to prisoners at guantanamo , and that the three should thus enjoy the same legal rights .
human rights activists have welcomed the decision as a huge step forward , as well as a stunning rejection of the arguments of the bush and obama administrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with obama 's new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan , bagram is likely to become more important the fact that the three detainees concerned in the ruling are neither afghan citizens nor were arrested in afghanistan improved their legal position .
the men were illegally transported or " rendered " to bagram from abroad - a practice amnesty international is demanding president obama end .
" nothing 's changed in this respect , " said muggenthaler .
" the cia still has the right to kidnap people and then transport them somewhere , for example to bagram , even if they 're now being treated better there now than they were in the past . "
plans to expand bagram pardiss kebriaei , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights , does n't think the obama administration will shut down the military prison in bagram .
indeed , she says the opposite may be true .
" there have been plans that we 've read about of the us building more permanent facilities at bagram and in fact , building a facility that would hold over 1,000 detainees in addition to the nearly 700 who are there right now , " she said .
" there 's new construction happening at the base , there 's greater permanence .
so given the fact that the us plans to send more troops to afghanistan and plans on being present in afghanistan for the foreseeable future , i think detentions will also increase , and this will be an important base for the united states . "
the subject of bagram has so far received little coverage in the german media .
german politicians - including those who usually take every opportunity to lobby for guantanamo 's closure - have been conspicuously quiet on the subject .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has largely been a lone voice in demanding for the afghan prison to be shut down .
meanwhile , human rights activists say that bagram is well on the way to becoming a second guantanamo .
they 're hoping that on this issue , as on so many others , president obama will choose to take a different path from his predecessor , george w. bush .

these promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier knows that the economy is set to be the main battleground in the vote " we know that crisis management is necessary , and that is the core of this program , " the social democrats ' candidate for the chancellery , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , told journalists on saturday , april 18 .
the spd is seeking to distance itself from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- as germany 's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on sept .
27 .
this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .
the much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's dirk niebel labeled the plan as " typically socialist " the party platform , which steinmeier will officially unveil on sunday , includes a 300-euro -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- tax rebate for people on low wages , in return for not filing a tax return .
the spd says the plan will not just help low-income earners , but also help cut red tape .
but the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on thursday , when the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung leaked the plans .
chairman for the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would hinder rather than help .
he said it would only complicate people 's taxes , and labeled it " the worst form of rip-off . "
secretary-general from the business-oriented free democratic party , dirk niebel , described the scheme as typically socialist .
his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the social democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent .
families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break .
the measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more , as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions .
the party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue .
the campaign trail begins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say merkel should n't be turning her back on steinmeier and the coalition the social democrats currently share power with their main political rival , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a right-left " grand-coalition . "
both sides , however , seem ready to sever ties after september 's election , although influential voices in both camps argue that , especially in difficult times , the grand coalition is the most prudent option .
the conservative cdu opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll .
" tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible , " cdu campaign manager ronald pofalla said last week .
" tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs . "

this year 's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis , which has hit key sectors of german industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay .
other key issues for the spd will be a move to ban the right-extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021 .
the social democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn until the next election .

the staging includes a bloody machinegun battle and a gang rape . scenes too drastic to stomach , actors say german media reports quote a spokeswoman for the chorus as saying that rehearsing these drastic scenes had been psychologically unbearable and had made many of the chorus members physically ill . apparently some people were n't accustomed to this sort of thing , said wunderlich , adding that other theaters were doing more shocking things , like the production of macbeth in duesseldorf , where actors throw real feces around the stage . wunderlich said the chorus still had enough people to perform and that some of the singers had even praised knabe 's work .
he said he did n't have the impression that the director was looking to generate headlines , or that he was denouncing one side or the other in the middle east conflict . knabe 's production is due to open on may 2 . gb / ncy , dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .

in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "
in the letter , rech wrote that he wanted to make use of the population 's readiness to handover dangerous firearms .
he particularly highlighted the need to fight " the unacceptable supply of illegal weapons , which we can not accurately estimate . "

others , like south korea and saudi arabia , have bought land overseas to help grow food for their populations . prices have dropped off since last year but experts warn that they could take off again once the world economy starts recovering . looking ahead the summit , which runs through monday , aims to put in place some concrete proposals on food security that could be presented to g8 leaders at their summit in la maddalena , sardinia in july . among them is a proposed global grain reserve , meant to stabilize food supply in times of crisis and avoid price shocks , but details have yet to be worked out . in addition to g8 and g5 leaders , agricultural ministers from argentina , australia and egypt are expected at the talks , along with representatives from the african union , the world bank and other international institutions . mrh / mr , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aid agency has accused industrialized nations of investing much more in their own agricultural sectors - stating an estimated $ 125 billion dollars was spent in 2008 in the form of direct payments to farmers .
the meeting has " an important role to play and we hope the concrete decisions will be taken -lrb- especially -rrb- in support of investment in developing countries , " said chris leather from oxfam . cg / tt , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german states -pipe- 18.04.2009 german state proposes gun amnesty after school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following march 's shooting , hundreds of germans have voluntarily handed in firearms a southern german state - the scene of a deadly school shooting in march - is proposing amnesty for people who hand in illegal firearms . according to a report to be published on monday , april 20 , in the german weekly der spiegel , weapons turned in to authorities in the state of baden-wuerttemberg would be accepted with no questions asked - provided they have not been previously been used to commit a crime .
baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .
in a separate incident in april , a 60-year-old man opened fire at a courthouse hearing an inheritance case in which he was entangled .
he killed his sister-in-law and wounded two others before turning the gun on himself .
a similar program was initiated following a massacre eight years ago in erfurt , when a student killed 16 people as well as himself .
unwanted firearms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has said fingerprint scanners installed on gun case locks are one safe-guard being considered according to der spiegel , hundreds of german citizens have handed over unwanted weapons in recent weeks that they either inherited or simply do n't use .
in the rems murr region alone - where winnenden , the site of the march shooting , is located - 370 weapons have been handed over to authorities since the massacre .
der spiegel also reports that a newly established taskforce in munich has collected 422 firearms , while three times as many as the average number of guns have been handed over in recent weeks in the northern city of bremen .
in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "
in the letter , rech wrote that he wanted to make use of the population 's readiness to handover dangerous firearms .
he particularly highlighted the need to fight " the unacceptable supply of illegal weapons , which we can not accurately estimate . "
the proposal was already put to the federal interior ministry and state interior ministers by rech in late march , where it was " positively received . "
federal interior minister wolfgang schaeuble will meet with his state colleagues in early june for a conference , where changes to gun laws are on the agenda . cg / tt , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

baden-wuerttemberg 's interior ministry confirmed to news agency ap that a working group would consider the proposal on tuesday .
the initiative to lower the number of illegally owned guns in germany comes less than a month after a 17-year-old shot dead 15 people in baden-wuerttemberg and then himself with a pistol he stole from his parents ' bedroom .
in a separate incident in april , a 60-year-old man opened fire at a courthouse hearing an inheritance case in which he was entangled .
he killed his sister-in-law and wounded two others before turning the gun on himself .
a similar program was initiated following a massacre eight years ago in erfurt , when a student killed 16 people as well as himself .
unwanted firearms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has said fingerprint scanners installed on gun case locks are one safe-guard being considered according to der spiegel , hundreds of german citizens have handed over unwanted weapons in recent weeks that they either inherited or simply do n't use .
in the rems murr region alone - where winnenden , the site of the march shooting , is located - 370 weapons have been handed over to authorities since the massacre .
der spiegel also reports that a newly established taskforce in munich has collected 422 firearms , while three times as many as the average number of guns have been handed over in recent weeks in the northern city of bremen .
in a letter seen by ap from baden-wuerttemberg 's interior minister heribert rech to justice minister ulrich goll , an official firearm amnesty initiative should be repeated " as fast as possible . "
in the letter , rech wrote that he wanted to make use of the population 's readiness to handover dangerous firearms .
he particularly highlighted the need to fight " the unacceptable supply of illegal weapons , which we can not accurately estimate . "
the proposal was already put to the federal interior ministry and state interior ministers by rech in late march , where it was " positively received . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.04.2009 german farm minister rejects pig patent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers worry about the effect on their livlihoods german agriculture minister ilse aigner has come out strongly against a european patent application for a test to check pigs for a gene that makes them produce more meat . " breeding livestock through cross-breeding and selective breeding must remain a patent-free zone , " aigner is quoted as saying in a pre-released interview with the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " it would not be acceptable for a firm to patent a genetically altered animal and afterwards demand license fees from breeders , whose animals exhibited this gene , " she said .
hundreds of people demonstrated earlier this week in front of the european union patent office in munich against the patent , which is owned by the us company , newsham choice genetics , whose initial application was approved last july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers and environmentalists have been protesting against the patent farmers , environmentalists and politicians say the patent opens the door to further commercial exploitation of bioengineering processes and undermines the livelihoods of farmers .
german states favor ban following this week 's protests , the major german farming states of bavaria and hesse have also come out in favor of a blanket ban for both plant and animal patents .
aigner also said there was " clearly room for improving current european patent law . "
germany is the world 's fourth largest meat producer and almost a quarter of the european union 's pork is raised in the country .
pork also plays a key role in the german diet - from sausages and cold cuts , to ham hocks and hearty roasts .
christoph then , a patent expert with greenpeace , said his organization feared that a growing monopolization of animal and plant breeding would lead to a small number of companies dominating the market and dictating prices .
not really genetic technology ?
the newsham pig testing kit was originally developed by us biotech company , monsanto , which was recently in the news after germany banned the use of its genetically modified corn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german culinary highlight : stuffed pork stomach with mashed potatoes the kit allows farmers to identify a particular gene in pigs that yields robust animals with body fat and meat proportions sought by the pork industry .
once pigs with the gene are identified , farmers can select them for intensive breeding .
christoph then argues that the process involved here is only a selective breeding tool , not genetic technology , and therefore should not be patentable . gb / ncy , dpa / epd / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" breeding livestock through cross-breeding and selective breeding must remain a patent-free zone , " aigner is quoted as saying in a pre-released interview with the sunday edition of the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " it would not be acceptable for a firm to patent a genetically altered animal and afterwards demand license fees from breeders , whose animals exhibited this gene , " she said .
hundreds of people demonstrated earlier this week in front of the european union patent office in munich against the patent , which is owned by the us company , newsham choice genetics , whose initial application was approved last july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers and environmentalists have been protesting against the patent farmers , environmentalists and politicians say the patent opens the door to further commercial exploitation of bioengineering processes and undermines the livelihoods of farmers .
german states favor ban following this week 's protests , the major german farming states of bavaria and hesse have also come out in favor of a blanket ban for both plant and animal patents .
aigner also said there was " clearly room for improving current european patent law . "
germany is the world 's fourth largest meat producer and almost a quarter of the european union 's pork is raised in the country .
pork also plays a key role in the german diet - from sausages and cold cuts , to ham hocks and hearty roasts .
christoph then , a patent expert with greenpeace , said his organization feared that a growing monopolization of animal and plant breeding would lead to a small number of companies dominating the market and dictating prices .
not really genetic technology ?
the newsham pig testing kit was originally developed by us biotech company , monsanto , which was recently in the news after germany banned the use of its genetically modified corn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german culinary highlight : stuffed pork stomach with mashed potatoes the kit allows farmers to identify a particular gene in pigs that yields robust animals with body fat and meat proportions sought by the pork industry .
once pigs with the gene are identified , farmers can select them for intensive breeding .
christoph then argues that the process involved here is only a selective breeding tool , not genetic technology , and therefore should not be patentable . gb / ncy , dpa / epd / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first came on a penalty kick in the 23rd minute .
leverkusen 's toni kroos scored the equalizer nine minutes into the second half . as the end of the game approached , it looked as if leverkusen might escape with a point .

cologne were unable to capitalize on several scoring opportunities to avoid the 3-0 shutout . the win moves stuttgart into a tie for third place with hamburg , with both teams on 51 points , but hamburg play sunday against hanover 96 .
stuttgart trail wolfsburg by six points . with stuttgart flirting with a spot in next year 's champions league , the battle for the remaining international spots remains intense . borussia dortmund got a win on the road against bochum , thanks to a first half header from patrick owomoyela and a blast from outside the box in the second half from nelson valdez .
