" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .
ukraine denies stealing and has accused russia of engineering the crisis . unacceptable earlier in the week , the two countries had come in for heavy criticism . " this situation is completely unacceptable , " said a statement from the eu 's presidency , currently held by the czech republic , and the bloc 's executive arm , the european commission .
" without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest russian and ukrainian authorities to the european union , gas supplies to some eu member states have been substantially cut . " " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said . " the czech presidency and the commission will intensify the dialogue with both parties so that they can reach an agreement swiftly , " it added . gas deliveries threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis comes at a bad time - the arrival of winter several eastern european countries have seen gas deliveries via ukraine fall sharply in the last few days . according to media reports , all supplies of russian gas via ukraine to bulgaria , turkey , greece , macedonia and were halted on tuesday . european union member states austria and romania said deliveries were down 90 percent and 75 percent respectively , and german energy firms warned there could be gas shortages in europe 's biggest economy if the dispute dragged on and sub-zero temperatures persisted .
" even our possibilities will reach their limits if these drastic cuts in shipments last and if temperatures continue to stay at very low levels , " e.on ruhrgas chief executive bernhard reutersberg said .
discrediting both countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is switching off the gas eu diplomats meeting in brussels on monday said that the row risks " discrediting " both countries . at the emergency meeting of eu national representatives , " more and more countries " said that " russia and ukraine are discrediting themselves as reliable energy sources , " an eu diplomat close to the talks told dpa news agency . some countries , especially those from central and eastern europe who have seen fluctuations in their gas supplies since the russian-ukrainian row began , " said that it is more important than ever to diversify and pay more attention to energy security , " the diplomat said . the meeting stopped short of calling for concrete action , instead agreeing that the dispute is a purely bilateral commercial one , and not an issue in which the eu should try to mediate - despite ukrainian calls for eu involvement . but diplomats also agreed that eu foreign ministers should discuss the issue further at an informal meeting in prague on thursday , the first time the issue has been passed to senior eu politicians , even on an informal level . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it be that an old problem in resurfacing in europe ? the fears were sparked after an anonymous caller to a greek radio station said that the far-left group revolutionary struggle had been behind an attack on monday , january 5 that left a greek policeman in critical condition . there was no immediate word on the authenticity of the caller , who said further attacks were imminent . but authorities were talking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of this teenager on dec .

" there are extremists who are ready to use such violence - not just firebombs but killings - to keep the upheaval going , " costas ifantis , professor of political science at athens university , told reuters news agency . what some greeks fear most is the revival of november 17 group , or n17 , the left-wing , anti-capitalist organization that carried out dozens of assassinations and bombing attacks over three decades in greece and only disbanded in 2002 .

" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it be that an old problem in resurfacing in europe ? the fears were sparked after an anonymous caller to a greek radio station said that the far-left group revolutionary struggle had been behind an attack on monday , january 5 that left a greek policeman in critical condition . there was no immediate word on the authenticity of the caller , who said further attacks were imminent . but authorities were talking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of this teenager on dec .
6 sparked the unrest " this is a group clearly trying to murder police , " greek police chief vassilis tsiatouras , adding that revolutionary struggle had carried out other acts of violence in the past . they included firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the us embassy in athens in 2007 .
the us state department has said it believes the group to have been behind nine such attacks since 2003 . " -lsb- the -rsb- attempted murder of three officers aims to undermine our country 's democratic stability , " greek president karolos papoulias said in a statement . new version of an old threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been solidarity demonstrations in hamburg monday 's attack comes after weeks of riots among left-wing youths angered by incident last december in which a greek police officer shot to death a 15-year-old . now , some fear extremist groups could use the volatile mood in the country to help restart left-wing terrorism . " there are extremists who are ready to use such violence - not just firebombs but killings - to keep the upheaval going , " costas ifantis , professor of political science at athens university , told reuters news agency . what some greeks fear most is the revival of november 17 group , or n17 , the left-wing , anti-capitalist organization that carried out dozens of assassinations and bombing attacks over three decades in greece and only disbanded in 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's major left-wing terrorist organizations disbanded with the end of the cold war but one expert says there are differences . " what you have are spontaneous , arbitrary attacks , " former us diplomat in athens , john brady kiesling told bbc news .
" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package , which could amount to between 40-50 billion euros -lrb- $ 55-69 billion -rrb- over the next two years , is expected to include investments in schools , public works and energy efficiency . with general elections looming in september , the two sides went into the talks with different ideas on how to shield europe 's biggest economy from the global economic downturn . although both parties agreed on the need for greater investments , the cdu favours a plan that includes income tax cuts to spur domestic demand , while the center-left spd is against such a move , arguing for lower health insurance contributions instead . prospect of tax cuts cheers investors the prospect of tax cuts brought a sense of cautious optimism to european stock markets on monday .
the sentix research group also noted that sentiment among euro-zone investors had improved for the first time in seven months in january , with an expectations index recording its strongest rise since august 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors in germany and the us were buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts " in the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact , " sentix told reuters news agency .
" we assume many indicators will follow the early indication from sentix in the coming weeks and months . " in november , merkel 's government unveiled its first stimulus package , which totalled about 31 billion euros .
experts said this was not enough to revive the economy because it included only about 12 billion euros in new spending . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said a formal decision on the new package would be taken at another meeting of coalition leaders on jan .
12 . the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , agreed at a separate meeting on sunday evening to make tax cuts a central plank of the new stimulus measures . cdu , spd have different goals the spd , which unveiled its own 40-billion-euro package on sunday , wants the creation of a special investment fund for community projects as well as higher taxes for the nation 's top earners . other measures under discussion are a bonus for families with children and incentives to help germany 's ailing car industry . despite their differences , the two sides are expected to hammer out a compromise in the coming week , senior officials from both parties said monday . " everybody knows we can not afford to let the stimulus package fail , " said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd chairman who will be challenging merkel for the chancellorship when the nation goes to the polls on sept .

none of the european countries would tolerate rocket fire on their citizens , and they must understand that hamas is a terrorist organization of the worst order that uses its population of women and children as human shields , " the president said . conditions for ceasefire faced with increasing international calls for a gaza ceasefire , israeli premier ehud olmert said tuesday that a ceasefire would only be possible if there were firm commitments to a stop to rocket attacks and to the smuggling of weapons into gaza from egypt . in remarks reported by israeli radio , olmert said israel was not under any illusion that there would be no israeli casualties in the military incursion in gaza targeting the radical islamist hamas . olmert also said he knew there would be protests from the international community against the military incursion .

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

countries throughout the continent are reporting an increase of anti-jewish acts . french president nicolas sarkozy warned on tuesday , jan .
6 that his country would not tolerate violence between muslim and jewish communities because of the ongoing conflict .
the admonition came after a burning car was rammed into the gates of a synagogue in toulouse late monday evening .
no one was hurt , but local jewish leader armand partouche said that people were inside the building at the time and could have been injured or even killed . he said his community was nervous . " we really fear that anti-semitism will spring up again and that the current conflict -lsb- in gaza -rsb- will be transposed to our beautiful republic , " partouche told ap news agency . french interior minister michele alliot-marie condemned the attack as " stupid and revolting . " " my concern is that the situation should not degenerate in our country , that the violence not be imported , " she told afp news agency . france has the eu 's largest muslim and its largest jewish communities , and tensions have risen since israel 's military reaction to hamas-sponsored rocket attacks began late in december . but it 's not just in france that middle east violence is threading to spill over onto european streets . " all antwerpers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european muslims have also made their feelings known with peaceful protests in belgium , the government announced on tuesday that it was taking extra precautions to prevent gaza-related unrest , after police reported that a gang had tried to set fire to a door of a synagogue in antwerp . it was the latest in a series of incidents including street scuffles between muslims and jews in the city .
leaders from both communities have appealed for calm . " the jews and muslims of antwerp do not share the same views on what is happening in the middle east , but that is no reason to bring the conflict here , " community leaders said in a joint statement .
" we are all antwerpers , flemish , belgian and neighbors . " and the problem is making itself felt in britain and denmark as well . " over the last week , we 've now seen over 20 , perhaps 25 , anti-semitic incidents that appear to be related to the violence in gaza and southern israel , " mark gardner of the community security trust , a jewish advocacy in britain , told afp . and in denmark a 27-year-old man of palestinian descent is being investigated for the shooting of two israelis last week . danish authorities say the shooting could have been related to anger stemming from the ongoing conflict in the gaza strip . anti-jewish acts by european muslims have spiked before in recent years , most notably during the palestinian uprising in 2000 and in 2002 during the war in afghanistan and us preparations for the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 expert says journalists are needed , if not wanted , in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap left by journalists shut out of the gaza conflict has been filled by citizens dw-world spoke to german media expert jo groebel about the importance of citizen journalism in reporting the conflict in the middle east - and the opportunity that presents for professional journalists . dw-world.de : has widespread use of the internet changed the way this crisis is reported compared to earlier conflicts in the region ?
jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package , which could amount to between 40-50 billion euros -lrb- $ 55-69 billion -rrb- over the next two years , is expected to include investments in schools , public works and energy efficiency . with general elections looming in september , the two sides went into the talks with different ideas on how to shield europe 's biggest economy from the global economic downturn . although both parties agreed on the need for greater investments , the cdu favours a plan that includes income tax cuts to spur domestic demand , while the center-left spd is against such a move , arguing for lower health insurance contributions instead . prospect of tax cuts cheers investors the prospect of tax cuts brought a sense of cautious optimism to european stock markets on monday .
the sentix research group also noted that sentiment among euro-zone investors had improved for the first time in seven months in january , with an expectations index recording its strongest rise since august 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors in germany and the us were buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts " in the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact , " sentix told reuters news agency .

" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .
ukraine denies stealing and has accused russia of engineering the crisis . unacceptable earlier in the week , the two countries had come in for heavy criticism . " this situation is completely unacceptable , " said a statement from the eu 's presidency , currently held by the czech republic , and the bloc 's executive arm , the european commission .
" without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest russian and ukrainian authorities to the european union , gas supplies to some eu member states have been substantially cut . " " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said . " the czech presidency and the commission will intensify the dialogue with both parties so that they can reach an agreement swiftly , " it added . gas deliveries threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis comes at a bad time - the arrival of winter several eastern european countries have seen gas deliveries via ukraine fall sharply in the last few days . according to media reports , all supplies of russian gas via ukraine to bulgaria , turkey , greece , macedonia and were halted on tuesday . european union member states austria and romania said deliveries were down 90 percent and 75 percent respectively , and german energy firms warned there could be gas shortages in europe 's biggest economy if the dispute dragged on and sub-zero temperatures persisted .
" even our possibilities will reach their limits if these drastic cuts in shipments last and if temperatures continue to stay at very low levels , " e.on ruhrgas chief executive bernhard reutersberg said .

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the admonition came after a burning car was rammed into the gates of a synagogue in toulouse late monday evening .
no one was hurt , but local jewish leader armand partouche said that people were inside the building at the time and could have been injured or even killed . he said his community was nervous . " we really fear that anti-semitism will spring up again and that the current conflict -lsb- in gaza -rsb- will be transposed to our beautiful republic , " partouche told ap news agency . french interior minister michele alliot-marie condemned the attack as " stupid and revolting . " " my concern is that the situation should not degenerate in our country , that the violence not be imported , " she told afp news agency . france has the eu 's largest muslim and its largest jewish communities , and tensions have risen since israel 's military reaction to hamas-sponsored rocket attacks began late in december . but it 's not just in france that middle east violence is threading to spill over onto european streets .

leaders from both communities have appealed for calm . " the jews and muslims of antwerp do not share the same views on what is happening in the middle east , but that is no reason to bring the conflict here , " community leaders said in a joint statement .
" we are all antwerpers , flemish , belgian and neighbors . " and the problem is making itself felt in britain and denmark as well .

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .

can it be that an old problem in resurfacing in europe ? the fears were sparked after an anonymous caller to a greek radio station said that the far-left group revolutionary struggle had been behind an attack on monday , january 5 that left a greek policeman in critical condition . there was no immediate word on the authenticity of the caller , who said further attacks were imminent . but authorities were talking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of this teenager on dec .
6 sparked the unrest " this is a group clearly trying to murder police , " greek police chief vassilis tsiatouras , adding that revolutionary struggle had carried out other acts of violence in the past . they included firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the us embassy in athens in 2007 .
the us state department has said it believes the group to have been behind nine such attacks since 2003 . " -lsb- the -rsb- attempted murder of three officers aims to undermine our country 's democratic stability , " greek president karolos papoulias said in a statement . new version of an old threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been solidarity demonstrations in hamburg monday 's attack comes after weeks of riots among left-wing youths angered by incident last december in which a greek police officer shot to death a 15-year-old . now , some fear extremist groups could use the volatile mood in the country to help restart left-wing terrorism . " there are extremists who are ready to use such violence - not just firebombs but killings - to keep the upheaval going , " costas ifantis , professor of political science at athens university , told reuters news agency . what some greeks fear most is the revival of november 17 group , or n17 , the left-wing , anti-capitalist organization that carried out dozens of assassinations and bombing attacks over three decades in greece and only disbanded in 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's major left-wing terrorist organizations disbanded with the end of the cold war but one expert says there are differences . " what you have are spontaneous , arbitrary attacks , " former us diplomat in athens , john brady kiesling told bbc news .
" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .
ukraine denies stealing and has accused russia of engineering the crisis . unacceptable earlier in the week , the two countries had come in for heavy criticism . " this situation is completely unacceptable , " said a statement from the eu 's presidency , currently held by the czech republic , and the bloc 's executive arm , the european commission .
" without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest russian and ukrainian authorities to the european union , gas supplies to some eu member states have been substantially cut . " " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said . " the czech presidency and the commission will intensify the dialogue with both parties so that they can reach an agreement swiftly , " it added . gas deliveries threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis comes at a bad time - the arrival of winter several eastern european countries have seen gas deliveries via ukraine fall sharply in the last few days . according to media reports , all supplies of russian gas via ukraine to bulgaria , turkey , greece , macedonia and were halted on tuesday . european union member states austria and romania said deliveries were down 90 percent and 75 percent respectively , and german energy firms warned there could be gas shortages in europe 's biggest economy if the dispute dragged on and sub-zero temperatures persisted .
" even our possibilities will reach their limits if these drastic cuts in shipments last and if temperatures continue to stay at very low levels , " e.on ruhrgas chief executive bernhard reutersberg said .
discrediting both countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is switching off the gas eu diplomats meeting in brussels on monday said that the row risks " discrediting " both countries . at the emergency meeting of eu national representatives , " more and more countries " said that " russia and ukraine are discrediting themselves as reliable energy sources , " an eu diplomat close to the talks told dpa news agency . some countries , especially those from central and eastern europe who have seen fluctuations in their gas supplies since the russian-ukrainian row began , " said that it is more important than ever to diversify and pay more attention to energy security , " the diplomat said . the meeting stopped short of calling for concrete action , instead agreeing that the dispute is a purely bilateral commercial one , and not an issue in which the eu should try to mediate - despite ukrainian calls for eu involvement . but diplomats also agreed that eu foreign ministers should discuss the issue further at an informal meeting in prague on thursday , the first time the issue has been passed to senior eu politicians , even on an informal level . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .

the package , which could amount to between 40-50 billion euros -lrb- $ 55-69 billion -rrb- over the next two years , is expected to include investments in schools , public works and energy efficiency . with general elections looming in september , the two sides went into the talks with different ideas on how to shield europe 's biggest economy from the global economic downturn . although both parties agreed on the need for greater investments , the cdu favours a plan that includes income tax cuts to spur domestic demand , while the center-left spd is against such a move , arguing for lower health insurance contributions instead . prospect of tax cuts cheers investors the prospect of tax cuts brought a sense of cautious optimism to european stock markets on monday .
the sentix research group also noted that sentiment among euro-zone investors had improved for the first time in seven months in january , with an expectations index recording its strongest rise since august 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors in germany and the us were buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts " in the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact , " sentix told reuters news agency .
" we assume many indicators will follow the early indication from sentix in the coming weeks and months . " in november , merkel 's government unveiled its first stimulus package , which totalled about 31 billion euros .
experts said this was not enough to revive the economy because it included only about 12 billion euros in new spending . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said a formal decision on the new package would be taken at another meeting of coalition leaders on jan .
12 . the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , agreed at a separate meeting on sunday evening to make tax cuts a central plank of the new stimulus measures . cdu , spd have different goals the spd , which unveiled its own 40-billion-euro package on sunday , wants the creation of a special investment fund for community projects as well as higher taxes for the nation 's top earners . other measures under discussion are a bonus for families with children and incentives to help germany 's ailing car industry . despite their differences , the two sides are expected to hammer out a compromise in the coming week , senior officials from both parties said monday . " everybody knows we can not afford to let the stimulus package fail , " said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd chairman who will be challenging merkel for the chancellorship when the nation goes to the polls on sept .

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

countries throughout the continent are reporting an increase of anti-jewish acts . french president nicolas sarkozy warned on tuesday , jan .
6 that his country would not tolerate violence between muslim and jewish communities because of the ongoing conflict .
the admonition came after a burning car was rammed into the gates of a synagogue in toulouse late monday evening .
no one was hurt , but local jewish leader armand partouche said that people were inside the building at the time and could have been injured or even killed . he said his community was nervous . " we really fear that anti-semitism will spring up again and that the current conflict -lsb- in gaza -rsb- will be transposed to our beautiful republic , " partouche told ap news agency . french interior minister michele alliot-marie condemned the attack as " stupid and revolting . " " my concern is that the situation should not degenerate in our country , that the violence not be imported , " she told afp news agency . france has the eu 's largest muslim and its largest jewish communities , and tensions have risen since israel 's military reaction to hamas-sponsored rocket attacks began late in december . but it 's not just in france that middle east violence is threading to spill over onto european streets . " all antwerpers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european muslims have also made their feelings known with peaceful protests in belgium , the government announced on tuesday that it was taking extra precautions to prevent gaza-related unrest , after police reported that a gang had tried to set fire to a door of a synagogue in antwerp . it was the latest in a series of incidents including street scuffles between muslims and jews in the city .
leaders from both communities have appealed for calm . " the jews and muslims of antwerp do not share the same views on what is happening in the middle east , but that is no reason to bring the conflict here , " community leaders said in a joint statement .
" we are all antwerpers , flemish , belgian and neighbors . " and the problem is making itself felt in britain and denmark as well . " over the last week , we 've now seen over 20 , perhaps 25 , anti-semitic incidents that appear to be related to the violence in gaza and southern israel , " mark gardner of the community security trust , a jewish advocacy in britain , told afp . and in denmark a 27-year-old man of palestinian descent is being investigated for the shooting of two israelis last week . danish authorities say the shooting could have been related to anger stemming from the ongoing conflict in the gaza strip . anti-jewish acts by european muslims have spiked before in recent years , most notably during the palestinian uprising in 2000 and in 2002 during the war in afghanistan and us preparations for the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it be that an old problem in resurfacing in europe ? the fears were sparked after an anonymous caller to a greek radio station said that the far-left group revolutionary struggle had been behind an attack on monday , january 5 that left a greek policeman in critical condition . there was no immediate word on the authenticity of the caller , who said further attacks were imminent . but authorities were talking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of this teenager on dec .
6 sparked the unrest " this is a group clearly trying to murder police , " greek police chief vassilis tsiatouras , adding that revolutionary struggle had carried out other acts of violence in the past . they included firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the us embassy in athens in 2007 .
the us state department has said it believes the group to have been behind nine such attacks since 2003 . " -lsb- the -rsb- attempted murder of three officers aims to undermine our country 's democratic stability , " greek president karolos papoulias said in a statement . new version of an old threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been solidarity demonstrations in hamburg monday 's attack comes after weeks of riots among left-wing youths angered by incident last december in which a greek police officer shot to death a 15-year-old . now , some fear extremist groups could use the volatile mood in the country to help restart left-wing terrorism . " there are extremists who are ready to use such violence - not just firebombs but killings - to keep the upheaval going , " costas ifantis , professor of political science at athens university , told reuters news agency . what some greeks fear most is the revival of november 17 group , or n17 , the left-wing , anti-capitalist organization that carried out dozens of assassinations and bombing attacks over three decades in greece and only disbanded in 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's major left-wing terrorist organizations disbanded with the end of the cold war but one expert says there are differences . " what you have are spontaneous , arbitrary attacks , " former us diplomat in athens , john brady kiesling told bbc news .
" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , that the military offensive against palestinian rocket squads launched by israel in late december has left up to 600 dead and as many as 3000 injured in gaza so far . many gazans have been left without electricity or running water , thousands have been displaced from their homes and residents say food supplies are running thin . death toll rising meanwhile , three soldiers were killed and 24 injured overnight by friendly fire , the israeli military confirmed tuesday morning . an israeli tank fired a shell by mistake at a building in which the soldiers had taken cover during fighting with armed palestinians , a military spokeswoman said .
one of the injured soldiers was in critical conditions and three others in serious condition , she said . the incident came a week after israel unleashed a massive air and naval bombing campaign against hamas targets in gaza aiming to stop rocket fire , and occurred as fighting between the israeli troops and local fighters of the islamic hamas movement intensified after darkness on monday . according to israeli media , israeli tanks firing cannons and machine guns and supported by helicopter gunships for the first time advanced into populated areas in the southern gaza strip and destroyed several houses , while the palestinian fighters confronted them with mortar shells . the israeli army claimed tuesday that it has killed 130 hamas fighters since saturday , while hamas resumed its artillery attacks in the morning , firing at least three rockets into the southern israeli eshkol region . israel 's image the european union troika , consisting of czech foreign minister karl schwarzenberg ; swedish foreign minister carl bildt and eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner , also met with peres in jerusalem tuesday morning - only for peres to blast european efforts to seek a halt to the gaza conflict . israel was not worried about its international image , his office said . " europe must open its eyes .
we are not in the business of public relations or improving our image .
we are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , " the nobel peace prize winning leader told an eu ministerial delegation . eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner told peres that " israel 's image is being destroyed " because of its refusal to listen to international ceasefire appeals , the president 's office said in a statement . peres said israel was " fighting a comprehensive war against murderous terror , which is of iran 's making .
none of the european countries would tolerate rocket fire on their citizens , and they must understand that hamas is a terrorist organization of the worst order that uses its population of women and children as human shields , " the president said . conditions for ceasefire faced with increasing international calls for a gaza ceasefire , israeli premier ehud olmert said tuesday that a ceasefire would only be possible if there were firm commitments to a stop to rocket attacks and to the smuggling of weapons into gaza from egypt . in remarks reported by israeli radio , olmert said israel was not under any illusion that there would be no israeli casualties in the military incursion in gaza targeting the radical islamist hamas . olmert also said he knew there would be protests from the international community against the military incursion .
but israel could no longer accept the steady barrage of rockets being fired at its border areas , he insisted . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .
ukraine denies stealing and has accused russia of engineering the crisis . unacceptable earlier in the week , the two countries had come in for heavy criticism . " this situation is completely unacceptable , " said a statement from the eu 's presidency , currently held by the czech republic , and the bloc 's executive arm , the european commission .
" without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest russian and ukrainian authorities to the european union , gas supplies to some eu member states have been substantially cut . " " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 expert says journalists are needed , if not wanted , in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap left by journalists shut out of the gaza conflict has been filled by citizens dw-world spoke to german media expert jo groebel about the importance of citizen journalism in reporting the conflict in the middle east - and the opportunity that presents for professional journalists . dw-world.de : has widespread use of the internet changed the way this crisis is reported compared to earlier conflicts in the region ?
jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 opinion : the eu is wasting another chance in the mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who speaks for the eu when it comes to mideast diplomacy ?
is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.01.2009 porsche boosts stake in vw to over 50 percent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche will soon be in the driving seat at vw german luxury carmaker porsche has taken over europe 's biggest carmaker volkswagen after purchasing more than 50 percent of its shares .
with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .

forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 opinion : the eu is wasting another chance in the mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who speaks for the eu when it comes to mideast diplomacy ?
is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

6 , that the military offensive against palestinian rocket squads launched by israel in late december has left up to 600 dead and as many as 3000 injured in gaza so far . many gazans have been left without electricity or running water , thousands have been displaced from their homes and residents say food supplies are running thin . death toll rising meanwhile , three soldiers were killed and 24 injured overnight by friendly fire , the israeli military confirmed tuesday morning . an israeli tank fired a shell by mistake at a building in which the soldiers had taken cover during fighting with armed palestinians , a military spokeswoman said .
one of the injured soldiers was in critical conditions and three others in serious condition , she said . the incident came a week after israel unleashed a massive air and naval bombing campaign against hamas targets in gaza aiming to stop rocket fire , and occurred as fighting between the israeli troops and local fighters of the islamic hamas movement intensified after darkness on monday . according to israeli media , israeli tanks firing cannons and machine guns and supported by helicopter gunships for the first time advanced into populated areas in the southern gaza strip and destroyed several houses , while the palestinian fighters confronted them with mortar shells . the israeli army claimed tuesday that it has killed 130 hamas fighters since saturday , while hamas resumed its artillery attacks in the morning , firing at least three rockets into the southern israeli eshkol region . israel 's image the european union troika , consisting of czech foreign minister karl schwarzenberg ; swedish foreign minister carl bildt and eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner , also met with peres in jerusalem tuesday morning - only for peres to blast european efforts to seek a halt to the gaza conflict . israel was not worried about its international image , his office said . " europe must open its eyes .
we are not in the business of public relations or improving our image .
we are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , " the nobel peace prize winning leader told an eu ministerial delegation . eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner told peres that " israel 's image is being destroyed " because of its refusal to listen to international ceasefire appeals , the president 's office said in a statement . peres said israel was " fighting a comprehensive war against murderous terror , which is of iran 's making .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 opinion : the eu is wasting another chance in the mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who speaks for the eu when it comes to mideast diplomacy ?
is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.01.2009 porsche boosts stake in vw to over 50 percent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche will soon be in the driving seat at vw german luxury carmaker porsche has taken over europe 's biggest carmaker volkswagen after purchasing more than 50 percent of its shares .
with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 expert says journalists are needed , if not wanted , in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap left by journalists shut out of the gaza conflict has been filled by citizens dw-world spoke to german media expert jo groebel about the importance of citizen journalism in reporting the conflict in the middle east - and the opportunity that presents for professional journalists . dw-world.de : has widespread use of the internet changed the way this crisis is reported compared to earlier conflicts in the region ?
jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 expert says journalists are needed , if not wanted , in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap left by journalists shut out of the gaza conflict has been filled by citizens dw-world spoke to german media expert jo groebel about the importance of citizen journalism in reporting the conflict in the middle east - and the opportunity that presents for professional journalists . dw-world.de : has widespread use of the internet changed the way this crisis is reported compared to earlier conflicts in the region ?
jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders from both communities have appealed for calm . " the jews and muslims of antwerp do not share the same views on what is happening in the middle east , but that is no reason to bring the conflict here , " community leaders said in a joint statement .

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said .

the package , which could amount to between 40-50 billion euros -lrb- $ 55-69 billion -rrb- over the next two years , is expected to include investments in schools , public works and energy efficiency . with general elections looming in september , the two sides went into the talks with different ideas on how to shield europe 's biggest economy from the global economic downturn . although both parties agreed on the need for greater investments , the cdu favours a plan that includes income tax cuts to spur domestic demand , while the center-left spd is against such a move , arguing for lower health insurance contributions instead . prospect of tax cuts cheers investors the prospect of tax cuts brought a sense of cautious optimism to european stock markets on monday .
the sentix research group also noted that sentiment among euro-zone investors had improved for the first time in seven months in january , with an expectations index recording its strongest rise since august 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors in germany and the us were buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts " in the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact , " sentix told reuters news agency .
" we assume many indicators will follow the early indication from sentix in the coming weeks and months . " in november , merkel 's government unveiled its first stimulus package , which totalled about 31 billion euros .
experts said this was not enough to revive the economy because it included only about 12 billion euros in new spending . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said a formal decision on the new package would be taken at another meeting of coalition leaders on jan .
12 . the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , agreed at a separate meeting on sunday evening to make tax cuts a central plank of the new stimulus measures . cdu , spd have different goals the spd , which unveiled its own 40-billion-euro package on sunday , wants the creation of a special investment fund for community projects as well as higher taxes for the nation 's top earners . other measures under discussion are a bonus for families with children and incentives to help germany 's ailing car industry . despite their differences , the two sides are expected to hammer out a compromise in the coming week , senior officials from both parties said monday . " everybody knows we can not afford to let the stimulus package fail , " said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd chairman who will be challenging merkel for the chancellorship when the nation goes to the polls on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.01.2009 porsche boosts stake in vw to over 50 percent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche will soon be in the driving seat at vw german luxury carmaker porsche has taken over europe 's biggest carmaker volkswagen after purchasing more than 50 percent of its shares .
with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .
ukraine denies stealing and has accused russia of engineering the crisis . unacceptable earlier in the week , the two countries had come in for heavy criticism . " this situation is completely unacceptable , " said a statement from the eu 's presidency , currently held by the czech republic , and the bloc 's executive arm , the european commission .
" without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest russian and ukrainian authorities to the european union , gas supplies to some eu member states have been substantially cut . " " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said . " the czech presidency and the commission will intensify the dialogue with both parties so that they can reach an agreement swiftly , " it added . gas deliveries threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis comes at a bad time - the arrival of winter several eastern european countries have seen gas deliveries via ukraine fall sharply in the last few days . according to media reports , all supplies of russian gas via ukraine to bulgaria , turkey , greece , macedonia and were halted on tuesday . european union member states austria and romania said deliveries were down 90 percent and 75 percent respectively , and german energy firms warned there could be gas shortages in europe 's biggest economy if the dispute dragged on and sub-zero temperatures persisted .
" even our possibilities will reach their limits if these drastic cuts in shipments last and if temperatures continue to stay at very low levels , " e.on ruhrgas chief executive bernhard reutersberg said .

jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .

can it be that an old problem in resurfacing in europe ? the fears were sparked after an anonymous caller to a greek radio station said that the far-left group revolutionary struggle had been behind an attack on monday , january 5 that left a greek policeman in critical condition . there was no immediate word on the authenticity of the caller , who said further attacks were imminent . but authorities were talking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of this teenager on dec .
6 sparked the unrest " this is a group clearly trying to murder police , " greek police chief vassilis tsiatouras , adding that revolutionary struggle had carried out other acts of violence in the past . they included firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the us embassy in athens in 2007 .
the us state department has said it believes the group to have been behind nine such attacks since 2003 . " -lsb- the -rsb- attempted murder of three officers aims to undermine our country 's democratic stability , " greek president karolos papoulias said in a statement . new version of an old threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been solidarity demonstrations in hamburg monday 's attack comes after weeks of riots among left-wing youths angered by incident last december in which a greek police officer shot to death a 15-year-old . now , some fear extremist groups could use the volatile mood in the country to help restart left-wing terrorism . " there are extremists who are ready to use such violence - not just firebombs but killings - to keep the upheaval going , " costas ifantis , professor of political science at athens university , told reuters news agency . what some greeks fear most is the revival of november 17 group , or n17 , the left-wing , anti-capitalist organization that carried out dozens of assassinations and bombing attacks over three decades in greece and only disbanded in 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's major left-wing terrorist organizations disbanded with the end of the cold war but one expert says there are differences . " what you have are spontaneous , arbitrary attacks , " former us diplomat in athens , john brady kiesling told bbc news .
" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.01.2009 porsche boosts stake in vw to over 50 percent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche will soon be in the driving seat at vw german luxury carmaker porsche has taken over europe 's biggest carmaker volkswagen after purchasing more than 50 percent of its shares .
with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 opinion : the eu is wasting another chance in the mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who speaks for the eu when it comes to mideast diplomacy ?
is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .
ukraine denies stealing and has accused russia of engineering the crisis . unacceptable earlier in the week , the two countries had come in for heavy criticism . " this situation is completely unacceptable , " said a statement from the eu 's presidency , currently held by the czech republic , and the bloc 's executive arm , the european commission .
" without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest russian and ukrainian authorities to the european union , gas supplies to some eu member states have been substantially cut . " " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said . " the czech presidency and the commission will intensify the dialogue with both parties so that they can reach an agreement swiftly , " it added . gas deliveries threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis comes at a bad time - the arrival of winter several eastern european countries have seen gas deliveries via ukraine fall sharply in the last few days . according to media reports , all supplies of russian gas via ukraine to bulgaria , turkey , greece , macedonia and were halted on tuesday . european union member states austria and romania said deliveries were down 90 percent and 75 percent respectively , and german energy firms warned there could be gas shortages in europe 's biggest economy if the dispute dragged on and sub-zero temperatures persisted .
" even our possibilities will reach their limits if these drastic cuts in shipments last and if temperatures continue to stay at very low levels , " e.on ruhrgas chief executive bernhard reutersberg said .
discrediting both countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is switching off the gas eu diplomats meeting in brussels on monday said that the row risks " discrediting " both countries . at the emergency meeting of eu national representatives , " more and more countries " said that " russia and ukraine are discrediting themselves as reliable energy sources , " an eu diplomat close to the talks told dpa news agency . some countries , especially those from central and eastern europe who have seen fluctuations in their gas supplies since the russian-ukrainian row began , " said that it is more important than ever to diversify and pay more attention to energy security , " the diplomat said . the meeting stopped short of calling for concrete action , instead agreeing that the dispute is a purely bilateral commercial one , and not an issue in which the eu should try to mediate - despite ukrainian calls for eu involvement . but diplomats also agreed that eu foreign ministers should discuss the issue further at an informal meeting in prague on thursday , the first time the issue has been passed to senior eu politicians , even on an informal level . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the injured soldiers was in critical conditions and three others in serious condition , she said . the incident came a week after israel unleashed a massive air and naval bombing campaign against hamas targets in gaza aiming to stop rocket fire , and occurred as fighting between the israeli troops and local fighters of the islamic hamas movement intensified after darkness on monday . according to israeli media , israeli tanks firing cannons and machine guns and supported by helicopter gunships for the first time advanced into populated areas in the southern gaza strip and destroyed several houses , while the palestinian fighters confronted them with mortar shells . the israeli army claimed tuesday that it has killed 130 hamas fighters since saturday , while hamas resumed its artillery attacks in the morning , firing at least three rockets into the southern israeli eshkol region . israel 's image the european union troika , consisting of czech foreign minister karl schwarzenberg ; swedish foreign minister carl bildt and eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner , also met with peres in jerusalem tuesday morning - only for peres to blast european efforts to seek a halt to the gaza conflict . israel was not worried about its international image , his office said . " europe must open its eyes .
we are not in the business of public relations or improving our image .
we are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , " the nobel peace prize winning leader told an eu ministerial delegation . eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner told peres that " israel 's image is being destroyed " because of its refusal to listen to international ceasefire appeals , the president 's office said in a statement . peres said israel was " fighting a comprehensive war against murderous terror , which is of iran 's making .
none of the european countries would tolerate rocket fire on their citizens , and they must understand that hamas is a terrorist organization of the worst order that uses its population of women and children as human shields , " the president said . conditions for ceasefire faced with increasing international calls for a gaza ceasefire , israeli premier ehud olmert said tuesday that a ceasefire would only be possible if there were firm commitments to a stop to rocket attacks and to the smuggling of weapons into gaza from egypt . in remarks reported by israeli radio , olmert said israel was not under any illusion that there would be no israeli casualties in the military incursion in gaza targeting the radical islamist hamas . olmert also said he knew there would be protests from the international community against the military incursion .
but israel could no longer accept the steady barrage of rockets being fired at its border areas , he insisted . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 opinion : the eu is wasting another chance in the mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who speaks for the eu when it comes to mideast diplomacy ?
is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 expert says journalists are needed , if not wanted , in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap left by journalists shut out of the gaza conflict has been filled by citizens dw-world spoke to german media expert jo groebel about the importance of citizen journalism in reporting the conflict in the middle east - and the opportunity that presents for professional journalists . dw-world.de : has widespread use of the internet changed the way this crisis is reported compared to earlier conflicts in the region ?
jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

the israeli military said it was checking the reports . witnesses said the school was hit shortly after local militants fired mortar shells from near the school at the israeli tanks . most of those killed had been outside at the time the projectile struck , but people inside were also injured by shrapnel . local palestinian television showed bloodstains and shoes and slippers scattered on the ground .
severely injured palestinians could also be seen being carried into palestinian ambulances . unrwa staff said the school was waving a blue un flag and that the agency had passed the gps coordinates to israel of its schools and shelters in gaza . more schools under fire even so , four unwra schools had been caught in the crossfire over the past days .
another unwra school in gaza city sheltering some 400 civilians was hit just overnight , with three palestinians killed as they used flashlights to go to the toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been pounded from the air , sea and land hassanein said the death toll in the gaza strip since the beginning of the israeli air and ground offensive on december 27 now topped 630 , while over 2,600 have been wounded .
at least a quarter of the dead are civilians , according to un staff on the ground . more than 80 palestinians were killed tuesday since midnight , including at least 12 members of the same family , al-daia , when israel shelled or rocketed their house their house in southern gaza city 's zaytoun neighborhood . reports state israeli troops have surrounded gaza city israeli ground troops , who entered gaza on saturday after a week of relentless airstrikes , have encircled gaza city - which faces the mediterranean on the west - from the south , east and north . in addition to the outskirts of jabaliya , a crowded camp considered the hub of palestinian rocket-launching squads , they are also on the outskirts of khan younis in the south . a palestinian militant leader denied reports that the ground troops had advanced into populated areas , saying they were still occupying largely open areas . but residents said local militants confronting those ground troops have been launching anti-tank missiles and mortar shells at them from behind and from the roofs of nearby civilian buildings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground troops have reportedly surrounded gaza city when israeli fighter jets or helicopter gunships then locate the source of the fire and strike back , the militants have run away and civilians are killed in their stead , they said . hamas ' armed wing , the qassam brigades , confirmed in a statement sent to journalists that its militants were confronting the israeli soldiers with anti-tank missiles and mortar shells , as well as roadside bombs , and " face to face " exchanges of fire . six israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground fighting started saturday , three of them late monday when an israeli tank erroneously shelled a house on the outskirts of jabaliya , in which the troops had taken cover .

another unwra school in gaza city sheltering some 400 civilians was hit just overnight , with three palestinians killed as they used flashlights to go to the toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been pounded from the air , sea and land hassanein said the death toll in the gaza strip since the beginning of the israeli air and ground offensive on december 27 now topped 630 , while over 2,600 have been wounded .

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days .

turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the israeli military said it was checking the reports . witnesses said the school was hit shortly after local militants fired mortar shells from near the school at the israeli tanks . most of those killed had been outside at the time the projectile struck , but people inside were also injured by shrapnel . local palestinian television showed bloodstains and shoes and slippers scattered on the ground .
severely injured palestinians could also be seen being carried into palestinian ambulances . unrwa staff said the school was waving a blue un flag and that the agency had passed the gps coordinates to israel of its schools and shelters in gaza . more schools under fire even so , four unwra schools had been caught in the crossfire over the past days .
another unwra school in gaza city sheltering some 400 civilians was hit just overnight , with three palestinians killed as they used flashlights to go to the toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been pounded from the air , sea and land hassanein said the death toll in the gaza strip since the beginning of the israeli air and ground offensive on december 27 now topped 630 , while over 2,600 have been wounded .

the admonition came after a burning car was rammed into the gates of a synagogue in toulouse late monday evening .
no one was hurt , but local jewish leader armand partouche said that people were inside the building at the time and could have been injured or even killed . he said his community was nervous . " we really fear that anti-semitism will spring up again and that the current conflict -lsb- in gaza -rsb- will be transposed to our beautiful republic , " partouche told ap news agency . french interior minister michele alliot-marie condemned the attack as " stupid and revolting . " " my concern is that the situation should not degenerate in our country , that the violence not be imported , " she told afp news agency . france has the eu 's largest muslim and its largest jewish communities , and tensions have risen since israel 's military reaction to hamas-sponsored rocket attacks began late in december . but it 's not just in france that middle east violence is threading to spill over onto european streets .

leaders from both communities have appealed for calm . " the jews and muslims of antwerp do not share the same views on what is happening in the middle east , but that is no reason to bring the conflict here , " community leaders said in a joint statement .
" we are all antwerpers , flemish , belgian and neighbors . " and the problem is making itself felt in britain and denmark as well .

countries throughout the continent are reporting an increase of anti-jewish acts . french president nicolas sarkozy warned on tuesday , jan .
6 that his country would not tolerate violence between muslim and jewish communities because of the ongoing conflict .
the admonition came after a burning car was rammed into the gates of a synagogue in toulouse late monday evening .
no one was hurt , but local jewish leader armand partouche said that people were inside the building at the time and could have been injured or even killed . he said his community was nervous . " we really fear that anti-semitism will spring up again and that the current conflict -lsb- in gaza -rsb- will be transposed to our beautiful republic , " partouche told ap news agency . french interior minister michele alliot-marie condemned the attack as " stupid and revolting . " " my concern is that the situation should not degenerate in our country , that the violence not be imported , " she told afp news agency . france has the eu 's largest muslim and its largest jewish communities , and tensions have risen since israel 's military reaction to hamas-sponsored rocket attacks began late in december . but it 's not just in france that middle east violence is threading to spill over onto european streets . " all antwerpers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european muslims have also made their feelings known with peaceful protests in belgium , the government announced on tuesday that it was taking extra precautions to prevent gaza-related unrest , after police reported that a gang had tried to set fire to a door of a synagogue in antwerp . it was the latest in a series of incidents including street scuffles between muslims and jews in the city .
leaders from both communities have appealed for calm . " the jews and muslims of antwerp do not share the same views on what is happening in the middle east , but that is no reason to bring the conflict here , " community leaders said in a joint statement .
" we are all antwerpers , flemish , belgian and neighbors . " and the problem is making itself felt in britain and denmark as well . " over the last week , we 've now seen over 20 , perhaps 25 , anti-semitic incidents that appear to be related to the violence in gaza and southern israel , " mark gardner of the community security trust , a jewish advocacy in britain , told afp . and in denmark a 27-year-old man of palestinian descent is being investigated for the shooting of two israelis last week . danish authorities say the shooting could have been related to anger stemming from the ongoing conflict in the gaza strip . anti-jewish acts by european muslims have spiked before in recent years , most notably during the palestinian uprising in 2000 and in 2002 during the war in afghanistan and us preparations for the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 expert says journalists are needed , if not wanted , in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap left by journalists shut out of the gaza conflict has been filled by citizens dw-world spoke to german media expert jo groebel about the importance of citizen journalism in reporting the conflict in the middle east - and the opportunity that presents for professional journalists . dw-world.de : has widespread use of the internet changed the way this crisis is reported compared to earlier conflicts in the region ?
jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .

jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sentix research group also noted that sentiment among euro-zone investors had improved for the first time in seven months in january , with an expectations index recording its strongest rise since august 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors in germany and the us were buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts " in the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact , " sentix told reuters news agency .
" we assume many indicators will follow the early indication from sentix in the coming weeks and months . " in november , merkel 's government unveiled its first stimulus package , which totalled about 31 billion euros .
experts said this was not enough to revive the economy because it included only about 12 billion euros in new spending . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said a formal decision on the new package would be taken at another meeting of coalition leaders on jan .
12 . the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , agreed at a separate meeting on sunday evening to make tax cuts a central plank of the new stimulus measures . cdu , spd have different goals the spd , which unveiled its own 40-billion-euro package on sunday , wants the creation of a special investment fund for community projects as well as higher taxes for the nation 's top earners . other measures under discussion are a bonus for families with children and incentives to help germany 's ailing car industry . despite their differences , the two sides are expected to hammer out a compromise in the coming week , senior officials from both parties said monday . " everybody knows we can not afford to let the stimulus package fail , " said foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd chairman who will be challenging merkel for the chancellorship when the nation goes to the polls on sept .

one of the injured soldiers was in critical conditions and three others in serious condition , she said . the incident came a week after israel unleashed a massive air and naval bombing campaign against hamas targets in gaza aiming to stop rocket fire , and occurred as fighting between the israeli troops and local fighters of the islamic hamas movement intensified after darkness on monday . according to israeli media , israeli tanks firing cannons and machine guns and supported by helicopter gunships for the first time advanced into populated areas in the southern gaza strip and destroyed several houses , while the palestinian fighters confronted them with mortar shells . the israeli army claimed tuesday that it has killed 130 hamas fighters since saturday , while hamas resumed its artillery attacks in the morning , firing at least three rockets into the southern israeli eshkol region . israel 's image the european union troika , consisting of czech foreign minister karl schwarzenberg ; swedish foreign minister carl bildt and eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner , also met with peres in jerusalem tuesday morning - only for peres to blast european efforts to seek a halt to the gaza conflict . israel was not worried about its international image , his office said .

none of the european countries would tolerate rocket fire on their citizens , and they must understand that hamas is a terrorist organization of the worst order that uses its population of women and children as human shields , " the president said . conditions for ceasefire faced with increasing international calls for a gaza ceasefire , israeli premier ehud olmert said tuesday that a ceasefire would only be possible if there were firm commitments to a stop to rocket attacks and to the smuggling of weapons into gaza from egypt . in remarks reported by israeli radio , olmert said israel was not under any illusion that there would be no israeli casualties in the military incursion in gaza targeting the radical islamist hamas . olmert also said he knew there would be protests from the international community against the military incursion .

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

is it the european delegation under czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , or the previous president of the eu , france 's nicolas sarkozy ? sarkozy is currently in the mideast as one of the leaders of the newly minted economic and political entity , the mediterranean union .
sarkozy and egyptian president hosni mubarak are currently sharing a two-year mediterranean union presidency . on jan .
4 , 2008 , france and egypt , along with turkey , condemned the israeli ground invasion in gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph hasselbach technically speaking , the eu group plays a decisive role .
according to brussels , the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are not treading the same ground , but instead are there to complement one another .
an embarrassing image eu comission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily said that any effort is welcome , as long as it sends a unified eu message to the parties in the conflict .
but that is an idealized way of thinking .
in reality , the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict .
on the one side is the weak czech eu presidency , hindered by internal squabbling over europe .
clearly , they should be the leaders - but they either will not or can not take on that role .
on the other hand there is the french president , who fairly bristles with self confidence and ambition , and would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president .
he wants to lead and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to .
kouchner 's troublesome role especially troublesome is the position of french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
in this case he is not part of sarkozy 's group - he is one of schwarzenberg 's troika .
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict .
schwarzenberg focuses on the right of israel to defend itself , and kouchner says israel 's military actions are disproportionate .
what 's more , the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically in the name of the german government .
as understandable as every individual attempt is , the eu should n't be surprised that it is unsuccessful diplomatically , given the variety of messages it is sending .
the result can be seen in the attitudes of the israeli government , which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant .
wasted opportunity ?
but actually , there is a good chance that the europeans could play a constructive role in the region .
the us under george w. bush failed in the middle east and the president elect , barack obama , will need time to find his footing in foreign policy .
sarkozy wanted , and wants , to make the eu into a foreign policy actor on the mideast stage that can hold its own with the usa .
but once more that opportunity is being lost - through sarkozy 's own misplaced efforts .

can it be that an old problem in resurfacing in europe ? the fears were sparked after an anonymous caller to a greek radio station said that the far-left group revolutionary struggle had been behind an attack on monday , january 5 that left a greek policeman in critical condition . there was no immediate word on the authenticity of the caller , who said further attacks were imminent . but authorities were talking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of this teenager on dec .
6 sparked the unrest " this is a group clearly trying to murder police , " greek police chief vassilis tsiatouras , adding that revolutionary struggle had carried out other acts of violence in the past . they included firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the us embassy in athens in 2007 .
the us state department has said it believes the group to have been behind nine such attacks since 2003 . " -lsb- the -rsb- attempted murder of three officers aims to undermine our country 's democratic stability , " greek president karolos papoulias said in a statement . new version of an old threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been solidarity demonstrations in hamburg monday 's attack comes after weeks of riots among left-wing youths angered by incident last december in which a greek police officer shot to death a 15-year-old . now , some fear extremist groups could use the volatile mood in the country to help restart left-wing terrorism . " there are extremists who are ready to use such violence - not just firebombs but killings - to keep the upheaval going , " costas ifantis , professor of political science at athens university , told reuters news agency . what some greeks fear most is the revival of november 17 group , or n17 , the left-wing , anti-capitalist organization that carried out dozens of assassinations and bombing attacks over three decades in greece and only disbanded in 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's major left-wing terrorist organizations disbanded with the end of the cold war but one expert says there are differences . " what you have are spontaneous , arbitrary attacks , " former us diplomat in athens , john brady kiesling told bbc news .
" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .

skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package , which could amount to between 40-50 billion euros -lrb- $ 55-69 billion -rrb- over the next two years , is expected to include investments in schools , public works and energy efficiency . with general elections looming in september , the two sides went into the talks with different ideas on how to shield europe 's biggest economy from the global economic downturn . although both parties agreed on the need for greater investments , the cdu favours a plan that includes income tax cuts to spur domestic demand , while the center-left spd is against such a move , arguing for lower health insurance contributions instead . prospect of tax cuts cheers investors the prospect of tax cuts brought a sense of cautious optimism to european stock markets on monday .
the sentix research group also noted that sentiment among euro-zone investors had improved for the first time in seven months in january , with an expectations index recording its strongest rise since august 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors in germany and the us were buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts " in the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact , " sentix told reuters news agency .

one of the injured soldiers was in critical conditions and three others in serious condition , she said . the incident came a week after israel unleashed a massive air and naval bombing campaign against hamas targets in gaza aiming to stop rocket fire , and occurred as fighting between the israeli troops and local fighters of the islamic hamas movement intensified after darkness on monday . according to israeli media , israeli tanks firing cannons and machine guns and supported by helicopter gunships for the first time advanced into populated areas in the southern gaza strip and destroyed several houses , while the palestinian fighters confronted them with mortar shells . the israeli army claimed tuesday that it has killed 130 hamas fighters since saturday , while hamas resumed its artillery attacks in the morning , firing at least three rockets into the southern israeli eshkol region . israel 's image the european union troika , consisting of czech foreign minister karl schwarzenberg ; swedish foreign minister carl bildt and eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner , also met with peres in jerusalem tuesday morning - only for peres to blast european efforts to seek a halt to the gaza conflict . israel was not worried about its international image , his office said . " europe must open its eyes .
we are not in the business of public relations or improving our image .
we are fighting against terror , and we have every right to defend our citizens , " the nobel peace prize winning leader told an eu ministerial delegation . eu external relations commissioner benita ferraro-waldner told peres that " israel 's image is being destroyed " because of its refusal to listen to international ceasefire appeals , the president 's office said in a statement . peres said israel was " fighting a comprehensive war against murderous terror , which is of iran 's making .
none of the european countries would tolerate rocket fire on their citizens , and they must understand that hamas is a terrorist organization of the worst order that uses its population of women and children as human shields , " the president said . conditions for ceasefire faced with increasing international calls for a gaza ceasefire , israeli premier ehud olmert said tuesday that a ceasefire would only be possible if there were firm commitments to a stop to rocket attacks and to the smuggling of weapons into gaza from egypt . in remarks reported by israeli radio , olmert said israel was not under any illusion that there would be no israeli casualties in the military incursion in gaza targeting the radical islamist hamas . olmert also said he knew there would be protests from the international community against the military incursion .
but israel could no longer accept the steady barrage of rockets being fired at its border areas , he insisted . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can it be that an old problem in resurfacing in europe ? the fears were sparked after an anonymous caller to a greek radio station said that the far-left group revolutionary struggle had been behind an attack on monday , january 5 that left a greek policeman in critical condition . there was no immediate word on the authenticity of the caller , who said further attacks were imminent . but authorities were talking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of this teenager on dec .
6 sparked the unrest " this is a group clearly trying to murder police , " greek police chief vassilis tsiatouras , adding that revolutionary struggle had carried out other acts of violence in the past . they included firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the us embassy in athens in 2007 .
the us state department has said it believes the group to have been behind nine such attacks since 2003 . " -lsb- the -rsb- attempted murder of three officers aims to undermine our country 's democratic stability , " greek president karolos papoulias said in a statement . new version of an old threat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been solidarity demonstrations in hamburg monday 's attack comes after weeks of riots among left-wing youths angered by incident last december in which a greek police officer shot to death a 15-year-old . now , some fear extremist groups could use the volatile mood in the country to help restart left-wing terrorism . " there are extremists who are ready to use such violence - not just firebombs but killings - to keep the upheaval going , " costas ifantis , professor of political science at athens university , told reuters news agency . what some greeks fear most is the revival of november 17 group , or n17 , the left-wing , anti-capitalist organization that carried out dozens of assassinations and bombing attacks over three decades in greece and only disbanded in 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's major left-wing terrorist organizations disbanded with the end of the cold war but one expert says there are differences . " what you have are spontaneous , arbitrary attacks , " former us diplomat in athens , john brady kiesling told bbc news .
" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i spoke with -lrb- gazprom chairman -rrb- alexei miller , " dubina said .
" we will take up the discussions again on thursday . " gazprom and naftogaz broke off talks on the last day of 2008 after failing to agree on a host of issues including gas pricing , transit fees , and contract terms for on-shipment of russian gas to european markets duing 2009 . the break-down in negotiations led to a total russian cut-off of gas supplies sent to ukraine , and roughly a one-quarter reduction of russian gas moving onward to europe . the eu depends on russia for around a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 percent of which is pumped through ukraine . moscow has since accused ukraine of illegally removing gas transiting its country for clients further downstream in europe .
ukraine denies stealing and has accused russia of engineering the crisis . unacceptable earlier in the week , the two countries had come in for heavy criticism . " this situation is completely unacceptable , " said a statement from the eu 's presidency , currently held by the czech republic , and the bloc 's executive arm , the european commission .

the christian democratic politician was put into a coma due to the serious head injuries he sustained on the slopes on new years day .
beata c. , a mother of four , died a few hours after the high-speed collision . local prosecutors have said that he was now being investigated for suspected homicide as a result of negligence , an offence which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison under austrian law . unlike althaus , the woman was not wearing a safety helmet , and local police and doctors reportedly maintained that althaus 's headwear probably saved his life . the accident promptly triggered calls for ski helmets to become mandatoryamong austrian politicians , who cited statistics showing that over 80 percent of head injuries could be prevented by helmets . in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the woman who died was not wearing a helmet whether or not a law is passed , the consumers have already taken note : " demand for skiing helmets has risen drastically , " said werner haizmann , president of the association of german sports retailers , estimating that sales are up by nearly 50 percent . stores across the country confirm that up to three times as many skiing helmets have been sold in the least few days . at the munich sports store schuster , one sales assistant told ap that sales this year are unprecedently high : " in the last three years they 've become increasingly fashionable but it 's getting hysterical , " he said . and while children 's helmets have generally been the bestsellers , these days adult models are equally popular .
at the high end of the market , a helmet can cost up to 150 euros and tends to be bought by both beginners and more advanced skiers - not least because new technology helps athletes reach faster speeds than ever before . safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmets could become mandatory and consequently , the designs are getting ever more daring .
today 's skiing helmets sport panda patterns or fur covers .
skiers can even hit the slopes with a helmet designed to look like a watermelon , if they dare . but safety comes first . now that a helmet has become an essential part of any skier 's equipment , almost every manufacturer includes them in their catalogue .
most have the same basic structure and manufacturers have learned to distinguish the subtle details of their models , such as lightness . a good helmet can be adjusted to fit the head and will also include a ventilation system : getting sweaty can mean a skier could freeze . some manufacturers have developed adjustable ear protectors for its helmets , which are designed not to block out too much sound , while others have integrated diode lights into its children 's models so parents can find their children in the fog . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when there is a political window , they will mount an attack - without the level of preparation that n17 used . " " they are dangerous , but not nearly as dangerous , " kiesling added . most western european countries have been free of significant left-wing terrorism with the demise of groups like germany 's raf and italy 's red brigades in the late 1980s and early ' 90s . but the unrest in greece has drawn expressions of solidarity from would-be revolutionaries in many parts of europe , and an escalation of the conflict would raise at least the spectre of a resurgent form of left-wing terrorism on the continent . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the czech eu presidency and the european commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute , " the eu statement said .

" even our possibilities will reach their limits if these drastic cuts in shipments last and if temperatures continue to stay at very low levels , " e.on ruhrgas chief executive bernhard reutersberg said .

the package , which could amount to between 40-50 billion euros -lrb- $ 55-69 billion -rrb- over the next two years , is expected to include investments in schools , public works and energy efficiency . with general elections looming in september , the two sides went into the talks with different ideas on how to shield europe 's biggest economy from the global economic downturn . although both parties agreed on the need for greater investments , the cdu favours a plan that includes income tax cuts to spur domestic demand , while the center-left spd is against such a move , arguing for lower health insurance contributions instead . prospect of tax cuts cheers investors the prospect of tax cuts brought a sense of cautious optimism to european stock markets on monday .
the sentix research group also noted that sentiment among euro-zone investors had improved for the first time in seven months in january , with an expectations index recording its strongest rise since august 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors in germany and the us were buoyed by the prospect of tax cuts " in the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact , " sentix told reuters news agency .

with the move , it also attains indirect control over sweden-based scania . in a short statement released monday , jan .
5 , stuttgart-based porsche said that by buying new vw shares , it " will increase its participation to 50.76 percent " of the group 's capital , compared with 42 percent before . under swedish law , porsche now has to make a mandatory offer for outstanding shares in the heavy truckmaker scania , in which vw is lead shareholder . porsche " is not bound by pre-acquisition prices and is only obliged to offer the minimum price prescribed by law , " the statement said .
porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche has no " strategic interest " in the company , it added , nor is it interested in acquiring scania shares . scania speculation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is n't interested in scania porsche is reported to have said the minimum price for the takeover offer would be calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average stock exchange price of the scania shares during the 20 trading days prior to publication of the acquisition of the majority in volkswagen .
vw controls about 68.6 percent of the votes and around 37.7 percent of the capital in scania .
it is also the biggest single shareholder in scania 's german rival man , and is pushing for closer cooperation between the two companies under its own guidance .
according to ap , scania shares closed down 2.7 percent at 80.25 kronor -lrb- $ 10.42 -rrb- in stockholm .
forced delay porsche originally planned to acquire more than 50 percent of vw 's stock last year but was forced to delay the operation after the value of shares soared amid frantic stock market speculation . a massive short squeeze in late october briefly made vw the world 's most valuable company , with its share price rocketing to just over 1,000 euros from 210 euros in two trading sessions . on monday , vw shares closed at 254.74 euros , close to the range porsche had set for itself of between 200-250 euros . majority control porsche 's takeover sees a family-controlled company that makes just 100,000 sports cars a year obtain control of a national institution that makes five million vehicles every year . a porsche spokesman confirmed that the company planned to increase its stake in vw to 75 percent at some point this year , given a favorable market environment .
having more than 75 percent would allow it to seal a so-called domination contract giving it full financial control . german law ensures that a minority investor that owns 25 percent of a company 's shares can block strategic decisions , but in the case of vw that level is currently set by law at 20 percent , the amount owned by the state of lower saxony , where vw is based . porsche has challenged the so-called vw law and has received support from the european commission , which has threatened to haul berlin into european court again after a revised version of the law retained the 20 percent minority blocking threshold . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 06.01.2009 expert says journalists are needed , if not wanted , in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gap left by journalists shut out of the gaza conflict has been filled by citizens dw-world spoke to german media expert jo groebel about the importance of citizen journalism in reporting the conflict in the middle east - and the opportunity that presents for professional journalists . dw-world.de : has widespread use of the internet changed the way this crisis is reported compared to earlier conflicts in the region ?
jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?
the media have always been a major instrument of war .
some people even say they are more important to influencing public opinion than traditional arms and weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalism 's hour has arrived , groebel says now with this informal media , we have an even greater likelihood that each involved party tries to influence the respective informal communication , and its even simpler to do that than to try and influence traditional journalists - at least as long as these journalists try to maintain their ethics and independence .
are there any advantages to the proliferation of home-grown reports ?
at best , we get a very authentic picture of the events .
but we still have to be extremely careful in taking sides one way or the other , because there is such a high percentage of manipulation or opinion-influencing on the internet .
how does the media 's use of this kind of ' citizen reporting ' affect public opinion ?
can ideas more easily be swayed this way - or do people just seek out information on the internet that will verify their own ideologies ?
we can see can see there has been a certain change of opinion in this conflict .
in the beginning , polls showed that people applauded the israeli attack as a justified reaction to the permanent bombings and attacks from the hamas side .
right now the image has slightly changed .
we suddenly see there are innocent victims .
and it shows that in such a complex , broad , ongoing situation , opinions are open for change - and thus also for manipulation on the internet .
it just means we have to be more and more careful about drawing final conclusions based on subjective impressions and individual images .
so how can the end user get a balanced view of the gaza-israel conflict , given the diversity of sources available ?
instead of immediately taking sides , one should be as careful as possible , and try to get as much different information as possible - from journalists , from political statements , and also from the blogs and other sources , not just from one single source .
then you should try and combine those impressions .
that 's the way to get an objective view .
not to be glib , but how many people have the time to do that kind of research and synthesis ?
this proves my point , that it is still the hour of the journalist .
even if journalists don ’ t have immediate access to events , or have more problems in getting access - it is still up to them to act as a reliable filter or interpreter of events .
they should evaluate the second and third sources , and summarize what has been reported and present it to the public .
i believe as long as we are living in a world where journalists have professional training and ethics to follow , they are still the best source to trust .
on the other hand , journalists need to make it clear if certain information is ambivalent , or if there is no clear-cut view .
it means the end user does n't need to combine all these sources .
can we draw any conclusions from this conflict about the larger questions of citizen journalism versus sponsored journalism ?
blogs and any informal communication on the internet are no alternative for professional journalism .
only professional journalists have to be responsible .
they have a professional code and particular training .
this case of the israel-palestinian war shows clearly that there is no alternative to professional journalism - and definitely not citizen-based communication .
at best they interact and cooperate , but one does not replace the other .

jo groebel : the internet has in a remarkable and nearly dramatic way changed the way events like the conflict between the gaza region and israel have been reported .
in earlier times it was always the case that of course , an army tried to avoid most uncontrolled reporting by journalists .
now , even if an army tries on the one hand to block journalistic access to an event , there is an alternative public sphere where each individual who is part of the event can create a report , as long as they have access to the internet or a computer .
the problem , and the challenge , is that these reports are not automatically steered by journalistic ethics or a professional approach .
does this mean both hamas and israel have a greater chance of using citizen journalists to manipulate content and spread their own propaganda ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the israeli military said it was checking the reports . witnesses said the school was hit shortly after local militants fired mortar shells from near the school at the israeli tanks . most of those killed had been outside at the time the projectile struck , but people inside were also injured by shrapnel . local palestinian television showed bloodstains and shoes and slippers scattered on the ground .

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but huber said omv was not the only supplier to these customers . europeans forced to dig into reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipes may reach the eu but the gas is n't the flow of russian gas supply was also terminated at the ukrainian-romanian border , shutting gas to bulgaria , greece and macedonia , the bulgarian supplier bulgargaz said . bulgargaz chief executive dimitar gogov said his country had enough reserves " for a few days . " neighboring romania reported that the main pipeline bringing russian gas and covering two-thirds of its supply was shut down . turkish energy minister hilmi guler confirmed the complete cut-off of gas shipped through the balkans .
turkey hopes to increase deliveries of russian gas via an alternative pipeline under the black sea , he said . in prague , the czech gas importer rwe transgas said the flow of russian gas dropped by a " serious " 75 percent early tuesday .
the company said it would increase its supplies of gas from norway and dip into underground reserve to compensate . but if average nationwide temperatures fall below minus 5 degrees centigrade , these alternative gas sources would last for " weeks " only , rwe transgas executive jan nehoda said tuesday . eu changes its tune and condemns cuts the european union - which had previously remained aloof from what it called an inter-company dispute - on tuesday condemned as " completely unacceptable " russia 's latest the cut-off of natural gas to eu members . the czech government , current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the european commission demanded " that gas supplies be restored immediately to the eu and that the two parties resume negotiations at once , " a joint statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek talked tough and warned russia and ukraine czech prime minister mirek topolanek was less diplomatic , telling reporters in prague " other countries should not be held hostage - this is a message for both sides . " national gas suppliers in several eu-member states said the crisis underscored the importance for alternative supply routes for gas to europe , such as the nabucco pipeline , which bypasses both russia and ukraine to carry gas to europe from the caspian sea . europe is heavily dependent on russian natural gas deliveries , with moscow providing eu nations roughly one-quarter of all gas consumed , 80 per cent of it coming to market from pipelines crossing ukraine . " gazprom is doing everything in its power not to allow a reduction of gas to europe , but its powers are not boundless , " gazprom deputy chairman alexander medvedev told russian state television vesti 24 . putin gives gazprom the ok to raise stakes russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday gave gazprom the order to go ahead with a further 20 percent cut gas to ukraine by 65.3 million cubic meters per day - the amount moscow says kiev is stealing from european clients further downstream . gazprom had already fully cut deliveries of gas intended for ukrainian customers after talks on non-payments by kiev and gas pricing for 2009 expired on new year 's eve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and gazprom ceo alexei miller are turning the screw briefing putin in a televised meeting , gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed gazprom lower the supplies of gas earmarked for europe via ukraine by an amount equal to the volume it suspects kiev of diverting . he added that kiev 's debt would soon amount to billions of dollars if the deadlock continues .
gazprom claims an outstanding $ 614 million for late payments on 2008 supplies . ukrainian officials were quick to reject the russian claims , saying they had paid russia in full for all gas used through the end of 2008 , and that russian cut-offs in early 2009 were punitive . reductions in russian gas flow through ukraine are necessary to maintain pressure in gas pipelines , said naftogaz 's dubina . feeding the stand-off and polemics is long-simmering political tension between the two post-soviet neighbors . the current conflict came to a head at the end of 2008 with the expiration of the russo-ukrainian contracts for gas shipments .
ukraine rejected a price increase to $ 250 - from $ 179.50 - per 1,000 cubic meters on russian gas . gazprom cut the taps to ukraine in retaliation , and raised its asking price to 450 dollars .
ukraine countered with a demand the price of shipping gas paid by russia to ukraine be hiked from $ 1.6 to $ 2 per 1,000 cubic meters , an offer rejected outright by the russians . european customers pay a higher price to gazprom than ukraine , but industry analysts say kiev 's unwillingness to agree on a current market price is grounded on widespread industry expectations the price of natural gas will fall sharply in coming months , following the slump in global oil prices . moscow 's relations with ukraine have grown increasingly acrimonious over moves by kiev 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during its war with russia in august . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

transport alliance sewta makes its recommendations in a £ 350m five-year plan for a sustainable regional transport network in south east wales .
sewta said its findings were based on the " uncomfortable truth " that present transport trends could not continue .
its plan would reduce social exclusion , promote health and prosperity and protect the environment , it claimed .
sewta , the south east wales transport alliance , is a consortium comprising the region 's 10 local authorities working in partnership with public transport operators and users groups .
its regional transport plan -lrb- rtp -rrb- for 2010-2015 calls for improved accessibility for all , a shift towards alternative modes of travel and reduced climate change emissions .
it recommends that as rail serves most of the key towns in the region , and provides a vital link along many of the main traffic corridors , investment should be continued in increasing rail capacity and frequency .
as more people travel by bus than train in wales , it also aims to significantly improve the quality of bus services .
sewta 's key proposals more investment in public transport improved accessibility for all to reduce social exclusion reduced climate change emissions improved regional connectivity improved integration , information and ticketing promotion of sustainable travel choices better use of the existing road infrastructure source : sewta sewta 's report , moving people , puts dependence on the car as one of the main causes of poor health in the region , which it said has clear social , economic and environmental consequences .
" over time an increasing dependence on the car has led to high levels of traffic congestion and an inefficient transport system overall .
traffic congestion costs the local economy £ 600m a year , " said the report .
" building more and more roads is not an effective solution to these problems , and providing a sustainable transport system which meets wales ' national , international , economic and social needs is the biggest challenge the rtp must tackle . "
it said " effective and sustainable " transport connections to the rest of wales and beyond were vital to the region 's economy and people .
' significant impact ' walking was the most widely available form of exercise and accounted for one quarter of all journeys , but the report found men are walking 40 % less than 15 years ago , and women 25 % less .
it said that while cycling is a sustainable and practical means of making journeys , it currently accounts for fewer than 1 % of transport forms .
consequently , the consortium proposes a ' smarter choices ' programme to provide better opportunities for people to walk and cycle , including as part of linked trips by public transport .
sewta chairman jeffrey james said the plan would have a significant impact on the way people in the area would travel .
" the threat of climate change must challenge the way our travel behaviour impacts on the environment , " he added .

transport alliance sewta makes its recommendations in a £ 350m five-year plan for a sustainable regional transport network in south east wales .
sewta said its findings were based on the " uncomfortable truth " that present transport trends could not continue .
its plan would reduce social exclusion , promote health and prosperity and protect the environment , it claimed .
sewta , the south east wales transport alliance , is a consortium comprising the region 's 10 local authorities working in partnership with public transport operators and users groups .
its regional transport plan -lrb- rtp -rrb- for 2010-2015 calls for improved accessibility for all , a shift towards alternative modes of travel and reduced climate change emissions .
it recommends that as rail serves most of the key towns in the region , and provides a vital link along many of the main traffic corridors , investment should be continued in increasing rail capacity and frequency .
as more people travel by bus than train in wales , it also aims to significantly improve the quality of bus services .
sewta 's key proposals more investment in public transport improved accessibility for all to reduce social exclusion reduced climate change emissions improved regional connectivity improved integration , information and ticketing promotion of sustainable travel choices better use of the existing road infrastructure source : sewta sewta 's report , moving people , puts dependence on the car as one of the main causes of poor health in the region , which it said has clear social , economic and environmental consequences .
" over time an increasing dependence on the car has led to high levels of traffic congestion and an inefficient transport system overall .
traffic congestion costs the local economy £ 600m a year , " said the report .
" building more and more roads is not an effective solution to these problems , and providing a sustainable transport system which meets wales ' national , international , economic and social needs is the biggest challenge the rtp must tackle . "
it said " effective and sustainable " transport connections to the rest of wales and beyond were vital to the region 's economy and people .
' significant impact ' walking was the most widely available form of exercise and accounted for one quarter of all journeys , but the report found men are walking 40 % less than 15 years ago , and women 25 % less .
it said that while cycling is a sustainable and practical means of making journeys , it currently accounts for fewer than 1 % of transport forms .
consequently , the consortium proposes a ' smarter choices ' programme to provide better opportunities for people to walk and cycle , including as part of linked trips by public transport .
sewta chairman jeffrey james said the plan would have a significant impact on the way people in the area would travel .
" the threat of climate change must challenge the way our travel behaviour impacts on the environment , " he added .
the report has been submitted to the welsh assembly government , which will assess sewta 's plan and its request for funding , by march .

advertisement madoff is confronted by reporters as he leaves court in new york us prosecutors have called for bernard madoff to be locked up until his trial after it emerged he had been sending valuables to family and friends .
the prosecutor said that a single one of the packages sent in the post was worth more than $ 1m -lrb- £ 685,000 -rrb- .
they included jewellery , watches , pens , cufflinks and a $ 200 pair of mittens .
mr madoff 's lawyer , ira sorkin , said that his client had not realised that the mailings violated the freezing of his assets .
he also said that some of the items sent belonged to mrs madoff and so were not covered by the freeze .
the parcels were sent to mr madoff 's brother , his son and daughter-in-law and another new york couple .
' not a threat ' mr sorkin said that it had been members of mr madoff 's family who had brought the mailings to the attention of the authorities .
mr madoff was accused last month of running a fraudulent $ 50bn scheme , which involved existing investors ' returns being funded by cash from new investors .
at a bail hearing , judge ronald ellis told both sides to submit written arguments and said he would rule later on whether mr madoff would have to go to prison until his trial .
" he 's not a threat to the community and there 's no danger he 's going to flee , " mr sorkin said .
mr madoff is currently under house arrest in his new york penthouse .

cardiff council says it has secured £ 200,000 for the historic grade ii listed buildings at cathays cemetery .
the chapels were the subject of a local campaign after being placed on a list of threatened victorian buildings .
john farnhill , of friends of cathays cemetery , said : " it 's been a long campaign that 's finally come to fruition . "
cathays cemetery in cardiff is one of the largest victorian cemeteries in the uk .
it opened in 1859 and covers more than 100 acres -lrb- 40 hectares -rrb- .
civic leaders and members of influential families are buried there .
the finely decorated gothic perpendicular-style twin chapels with central bell tower were built in the same year the cemetery opened , at a cost of £ 5,300 .
one chapel was used for anglican services while the other was used by non-conformists .
the restoration work will see the both roofs made weather proof .
the lord mayor of cardiff , kate lloyd , was due to ceremonially " remove the first slate " from the roof .
the local authority said it was looking for further funding to fully restore the buildings .
mr farnhill said the action group had been set up in 2006 with the challenge of having the chapel restored .
he said : " we raised a petition with over 1,000 signatures on it which we gave to the council , and obviously somebody is listening because work is about to start .
" the initial roofing work will take 12 weeks and this will be the first phase of the restoration , preventing further deterioration to the building .
" it 's an important first step and we will be looking to work with the council on further phases . "
the group is planning an open day at the cemetery in july , to be held in conjunction with cardiff council 's bereavement services .

advertisement restoration work on cathays cemetery 's two run-down victorian chapels has begun .
the first phase of restoration work on two endangered chapels will begin on the 150th anniversary of their opening .
cardiff council says it has secured £ 200,000 for the historic grade ii listed buildings at cathays cemetery .
the chapels were the subject of a local campaign after being placed on a list of threatened victorian buildings .
john farnhill , of friends of cathays cemetery , said : " it 's been a long campaign that 's finally come to fruition . "
cathays cemetery in cardiff is one of the largest victorian cemeteries in the uk .
it opened in 1859 and covers more than 100 acres -lrb- 40 hectares -rrb- .
civic leaders and members of influential families are buried there .
the finely decorated gothic perpendicular-style twin chapels with central bell tower were built in the same year the cemetery opened , at a cost of £ 5,300 .
one chapel was used for anglican services while the other was used by non-conformists .
the restoration work will see the both roofs made weather proof .
the lord mayor of cardiff , kate lloyd , was due to ceremonially " remove the first slate " from the roof .
the local authority said it was looking for further funding to fully restore the buildings .
mr farnhill said the action group had been set up in 2006 with the challenge of having the chapel restored .
he said : " we raised a petition with over 1,000 signatures on it which we gave to the council , and obviously somebody is listening because work is about to start .
" the initial roofing work will take 12 weeks and this will be the first phase of the restoration , preventing further deterioration to the building .
" it 's an important first step and we will be looking to work with the council on further phases . "

the north wales hotel group said its members missed out on funding which was usually concentrated in large resorts .
the group includes the trearddur bay hotel and tre-ysgawen hall hotel on anglesey , the quay hotel in conwy , and soughton hall hotel in flintshire .
a spokesperson for visit wales - the welsh assembly government body responsible for promoting wales - congratulated the group .
tony riley , of the quay hotel , said the group decided to form because its members were not in the " honey pot " tourist locations which usually attract funding .
' fight for business ' experts have predicted a gloomy year for hotels and the leisure industry as the economic downturn continues .
but mr riley said pooling resources and cross-promoting businesses would help put north wales " on the map " .
each member has invested " a few thousand pounds " into the venture and the group will visit tourist fairs across wales and the uk .
mr riley said : " this is an important initiative for us in 2009 .
" we are not knocking visit wales but we need to fight for business .
" there are over 200 jobs involved across the four hotels and tourism puts back £ 10 million into the local economy each year . "
a visit wales spokesperson welcomed the move , adding : " it is recognised that during the current economic climate we all need to work in close partnership in order to succeed .
" we congratulate the group for taking the initiative and wish them well during 2009 . "

one act from the top five is being unveiled every day this week , counting down to friday , when the number one will be revealed .
empire of the sun are on a spiritual mission .
dressed as extras from a psychedelic star wars , the duo are on an epic journey to seek out ancient cultures across the globe , searching for inner enlightenment while creating a musical dynasty that will last for ever .
it seems like a tall order .
but the ambitious , enigmatic and utterly egotastic empire of the sun are dead set on their task .
so their debut album , the story it tells and the places it takes them is " a walk to finding the inner being " , singer luke steele says .
" it 's kind of like a spiritual road movie .
" we went to shanghai and met the emperors , and we went to mexico and met the aztecs , and now we 're going to iceland .
" it 's now or never and we have to push the limit .
there 's no holding back and there 's nothing to lose .
we really want to make something otherworldly and special . "
steele , who also fronts indie group the sleepy jackson , has teamed up with nick littlemore of electronic outfit pnau , who is friends with sir elton john , has worked with the killers and been in a band with ladyhawke .
together , the pair 's 1980s-influenced soft pop synthesisers and blissed-out space beats have already taken them into the australian top 10 .
the music is coupled with a striking image of two colourful , cosmic crusaders that has been inspired by movie characters and rosily-remembered childhood idols . "
music is magic , and with imagination combined it can be completely epic " luke steele -lrb- right -rrb- empire of the sun interview on bbc radio 1 newsbeat " we are superheroes .
we are emperor steele and lord littlemore , " proclaims the singer .
in the video for their first single , walking on a dream , the pair are seen in front of the shanghai skyline striking overblown , dramatic poses .
steele grandly waves huge feathers and a big red stick while wearing white face paint , a bright blue oriental frock coat , gold ceremonial neckwear and a tall ornamental crown that looks like it might have been a rather nice lampshade in a former life .
" we 've done the band thing , which is great , but we wanted it to be a lot more epic and theatrical , " he declares .
" we want to start something a bit bigger than what bands have been for the past 20 years .
we want to bring entertainment and colour and positivity and melody back into it . "
the album , also called walking on a dream , was made over two years between other projects .
" i was only ever in town for a night in sydney , where the studio was , so it was all quite spontaneous , " steele says .
" i 'm really good at writing top lines and coming up with chord progressions and production . "
littlemore is all of the above plus is " amazing in terms of writing words " , the singer says .
" he 's quite romantic with his words .
he 's like a beat poet . "
the group borrowed their name from a 1984 jg ballard novel , which was adapted for the screen by steven spielberg in 1987 .
" we wanted something quite epic , " steele says , citing the history of chinese emperors and the importance of the sun to the aztecs .
" and obviously jesus christ is the son of god and everything , " he adds , slightly inexplicably .
" we were looking for a name and we saw that and it just seemed so fitting . "
steele has become so immersed in the band 's mythology that he has even named his daughter , born in october , sunny tiger .
-lrb- the band also have a song called tiger by your side and tigers feature in their graphics . -rrb-
the singer now wants to blow the minds of young fans in the same way that pop stars did when he was growing up in the 1980s .
" we 're so visual , " he says .
" we want to make something that as a child you see and you just love because it 's so colourful and it 's got imagination .
" music is magic , and with imagination combined it can be completely epic .
we 've been both on the road doing shows for the last 10 years and we wanted something that 's higher - visually , mentally , physically , a bigger level , a bigger vision that can last for ever . "

finnoula earley foresees bumpy times during 2009 " the disruption in the financial markets worsened throughout 2008 and had larger implications for the real economy than we anticipated a year ago , " said fionnuala earley .
" we did not anticipate the speed of house price falls or the extent of the global and domestic economic slowdown , " she added .
downturn the nationwide 's survey confirms last week 's report from the halifax which also said that prices had dropped by 16 % in 2008 .
last year saw the biggest annual house price drop on record , which was prompted by a sharp fall in the availability of mortgage funds from lenders who had been hit by the international credit crunch .
this led to a sudden drop of in demand from buyers at a time when house prices had already reached record levels , as a result of which sales are currently down by 60 % .
with mortgage approvals suffering an even bigger fall , sales and prices are expected to continue to drop for the time being .
" prices have further to fall before significant numbers of buyers will be willing to return to the market , " said ms earley .
recession ms earley warned that the developing economic recession would drag the housing market down further .

more from today programme " until the economy and the labour market stabilise , it is hard to imagine households becoming upbeat about the immediate future for house prices and this will hinder the pace of recovery , " she said .
" in addition , the wider economic recession also impacts negatively on household expectations of future incomes . "
the royal institution of chartered surveyors , -lrb- rics -rrb- added to its voice to the calls for government action to reinvigorate mortgage lending .
" i think to secure an improvement in transaction activity what we will need to see is some measures taken to increase the supply of mortgage finance , " said simon rubinsohn , the rics chief economist .
regional changes the biggest fall in house prices last year was in northern ireland where prices dropped by 34.2 % , partly reversing the huge house price boom seen in the previous few years .
in scotland however , prices were much more resilient , falling by only 8.1 % .
elsewhere in england and wales the drop in prices was more uniform , ranging from 11 % in northern england to 16.6 % in east anglia .
prices are still highest in london where they average £ 257,963 .

to put it another way , the uk 's second biggest fashion retailer is selling one in twenty fewer skirts and shirts in shops unaffected by new openings .
this sounds disastrous .
but investors in its shares may actually breathe a small sigh of relief that its performance in the last five months of 2008 was n't even worse , given the gloom that 's engulfed the high street .
also there 's comfort to be had from next 's announcement that it 's on course to make profits in line with city forecasts of more than £ 415m before tax .
debenhams under pressure at debenhams too the theme is that it could all have been a lot worse , as the leading department store chain reported like for like sales down 3.5 % in the 18 weeks to the beginning of january .
although debenhams is widely viewed as having too much debt , barring an unexpected calamity both it and next will still be standing after the downturn in consumer spending which has exterminated weaker rivals .
what will particularly impress debenhams ' creditors is that the gross value of its transactions and profits have risen , the business is generating cash , and net debt has fallen but it wo n't be easy .
sterling problems next warns that the coming headache will be a massive increase in costs caused by the sharp devaluation of sterling .
in next 's case this does n't bite until the autumn and winter of this year , because it has hedged its currency exposure until then .
for most big retailers , including marks & spencer , the big impact of the weakened pound will come in the middle of the year .
there will be a horrible choice for next , m & s , primark and the rest , who buy most of their stock outside the uk .
should they absorb an estimated 20 % currency-related increase in the cost of clothing and other goods manufactured for them in china , india , hungary and so on ?
that , of course , would mean that their profits - which are already on a crash diet - would be squeezed further .
or , in a period of feeble consumer demand , is there any chance they 'll be able to pass on the cost increases to cash-strapped consumers ?
discounting their ability to pass on the costs to us will depend on the intensity of competition at the time .
right now , with tesco announcing yet another round of price cuts , there 's no sign of an easing up in the competitive assault .
in fact one of the reasons that the sales of debs and next were n't even worse was the significant discounting that took place in the christmas fortnight .
anyone who made the mistake - as i did - of venturing to a mall or shopping centre in late december will know that we have n't been wholly weaned off our spend-spend-spend habits .
there was a mob , frantically looking for bargains .
but we 're all back at work now , the last woolworths have shut their doors forever , and a chill wind is blowing through the economy .
those who run our biggest stores tell me they 're braced for the worst of winters .

but ryanair , which already owns 29.82 % of aer lingus , asked other aer lingus shareholders to accept the deal .
ryanair says it now has had acceptances totalling just 29.83 % of aer lingus shares , including its own stake .
its offer has been extended for five weeks .
" the offer has been extended and will remain open for acceptance until 1pm dublin time on 13 february , 2009 , " ryanair said in a statement .
aer lingus management had urged shareholders not to back the takeover when it was launched ahead of christmas , saying that it contained " nothing new " .
and the airline 's workers , which control a 14 % stake , have worries over job prospects , despite assurances from ryanair .
ryanair has offered 1.40 euros a share for the former state airline , just half the price of a previous offer in 2006 which was blocked by the eu on competition grounds .
this time ryanair says it plans to operate both airlines as separate companies with distinctive brands .
the 2006 offer was strongly opposed by major aer lingus shareholders , including the irish government , company employees , pilots and their pension fund .

and only more recently still that indonesia 's corruption eradication commission has started to flex its muscles inside the country 's parliament .
the arrest of several mps and the tapping of phones in the parliament building has led to a new nervousness among the country 's elected officials .
some admit to leaving their biggest , shiniest cars at home , or avoiding any discussion of financial matters by telephone - for fear of being called in by investigators .
the conviction of a sitting mp on corruption charges will drive home the point that parliament is no longer immune .
tackling the pervasive culture of corruption here was never going to be easy .
but nasution , now beginning an eight-year jail sentence , is one of the clearest signs yet that things are - slowly - changing .

advertisement cuddly toys that purr , birds to be shot and tiny pc virus scanners are among gadgets unveiled at ces the global economic downturn has not put many people off attending this week 's consumer electronics show .
about 130,000 people are expected to travel to las vegas for the show .
the show is the highlight of the hi-tech calendar and is a showcase for top gadgets of 2009 .
" it will be a bright spot compared to the uncertainty in the rest of the economy , " said gary shapiro , head of the consumer electronics association that stages ces .

consumer electronics association 's tim herbert on the demand for home entertainment mr shapiro said he expected the 2009 show to be among the top two or three in terms of attendees and exhibitors .
in 2008 attendance was slightly higher at 140,000 but , said mr shapiro , the number of exhibitors at ces had held steady despite the wider economic woe .
" i think we will see positive feelings there , " he said .
the 2009 show will see more than 2,700 companies showing off their wares across more than 1.7m square feet of exhibition space .
it is not clear how positive these statistics are because most firms paid well in advance for their stand space - most long before the global economic slowdown made itself felt .
downturn in previous years microsoft founder bill gates has opened the show but in 2009 steve ballmer , microsoft chief executive , will take on the task , delivering the keynote which will kick off the show on 7 january .
with rumours of microsoft about to announce significant layoffs the opening keynote could sound a sour note .
bill gates gave his last ces speech in 2008 but , said mr shapiro , the technology industry had survived many previous downturns .
" they always seems like the worst when you are experiencing them , " he said .
" but as a tech industry we are doing very well and people want to buy things and want to invest . "
he predicted that the technology industry would do well during the downturn as companies look to innovative products , be they in software or hardware , to cut costs and help their employees do more with less .
" industry leaders come because they want to see how the technology will be changing their business , he said .
location , location the show , said mr shapiro , reflected some of those larger themes with areas set aside for green products and those to do with sustainable development .
other big themes for the show included a big focus on mobile video , location services via handsets as well as net access and broadcast technologies for cars .
said mr shapiro : " the bottom line of it is internet on the go . "
alongside this will be exhibitors showing off technologies that unite many different technologies or that try to make familiar ones easier to use .
for instance , he said , ces will see firms showing off software and services that make it easier to get more out of a tv , camcorder or other handheld device .
" and , " he said , " there are always bigger , brighter screens . "
ces is well known as a showcase for new display technologies and the 2009 show is expected to see the appearance of many more organic led screens as well as many 3d tv and film technologies .

consumer electronics association 's tim herbert on the demand for home entertainment mr shapiro said he expected the 2009 show to be among the top two or three in terms of attendees and exhibitors .
in 2008 attendance was slightly higher at 140,000 but , said mr shapiro , the number of exhibitors at ces had held steady despite the wider economic woe .
" i think we will see positive feelings there , " he said .
the 2009 show will see more than 2,700 companies showing off their wares across more than 1.7m square feet of exhibition space .
it is not clear how positive these statistics are because most firms paid well in advance for their stand space - most long before the global economic slowdown made itself felt .
downturn in previous years microsoft founder bill gates has opened the show but in 2009 steve ballmer , microsoft chief executive , will take on the task , delivering the keynote which will kick off the show on 7 january .
with rumours of microsoft about to announce significant layoffs the opening keynote could sound a sour note .
bill gates gave his last ces speech in 2008 but , said mr shapiro , the technology industry had survived many previous downturns .
" they always seems like the worst when you are experiencing them , " he said .
" but as a tech industry we are doing very well and people want to buy things and want to invest . "
he predicted that the technology industry would do well during the downturn as companies look to innovative products , be they in software or hardware , to cut costs and help their employees do more with less .
" industry leaders come because they want to see how the technology will be changing their business , he said .
location , location the show , said mr shapiro , reflected some of those larger themes with areas set aside for green products and those to do with sustainable development .
other big themes for the show included a big focus on mobile video , location services via handsets as well as net access and broadcast technologies for cars .
said mr shapiro : " the bottom line of it is internet on the go . "
alongside this will be exhibitors showing off technologies that unite many different technologies or that try to make familiar ones easier to use .
for instance , he said , ces will see firms showing off software and services that make it easier to get more out of a tv , camcorder or other handheld device .
" and , " he said , " there are always bigger , brighter screens . "
ces is well known as a showcase for new display technologies and the 2009 show is expected to see the appearance of many more organic led screens as well as many 3d tv and film technologies .
