it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .
but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

the global economy will contract 1.1 percent this year , but will grow 3.1 percent in 2010 , according to the imf .

public spending , not private consumption , has kept many economies going during the past year .
the imf warned that governments should not pull back on stimulus measures too early .
for the crisis to end , there needs to be an upsurge in private demand , something which is " clearly going to be a challenge for advanced countries , " said blanchard .
economy will shrink in 2009 imf chief dominique strauss-kahn echoed this cautious optimism in a speech to students in istanbul . " the good news ... is that in our view the recovery really has started .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .

they do n't lead to the desired outcome .

a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2009 eu finance ministers debate how to pay for stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu finance ministers are wary of debt as recession ends nations across the european union have pumped billions into stimulus programs designed at boosting economic growth during the global recession .
now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2009 eu finance ministers debate how to pay for stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu finance ministers are wary of debt as recession ends nations across the european union have pumped billions into stimulus programs designed at boosting economic growth during the global recession .
now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .

" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .

now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .
many countries fear the enriched uranium could be used for making a nuclear weapon. sac / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 01.10.2009 germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic interests play a major role in europe 's relations to china communist china was founded 60 years ago , bringing an end to a decades-long civil war .
it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

this year ’ s partners for the so-called orchestra campus organized by the deutsche welle and the beethovenfest came from hanoi . young musicians from vietnam , performing ludwig van beethoven ’ s coriolan overture : the orchestra of the national academy of music hanoi was in bonn for a week for the beethovenfest , a yearly music festival dedicated to the famous german composer who was born here .
their two concerts were a special experience for the students - like french horn player vong ngoc long , who is only 20 years old .
" i love the audience " , said long .
" the way they clap , the way they listen to the music and the critiques after the concert !
so , so nice !
it ’ s a very professional hall to play , so i really loved to play here .
maybe i was a little bit too nervous , because i played beethoven ’ s music .
germans know it very well , so i was very nervous .
but i think we did our best and had a lot of fun . "
an exotic choice in the so-called orchestra campus , the young vietnamese worked with european conductors to prepare their concerts .
they stayed with host families .
western music , including jazz , is becoming more and more popular in vietnam .
but it still remains somewhat exotic .
for many of the young musicians , classical music wasn ’ t the obvious choice .
" no one in my family plays classical music , " said 26-year-old quang , who plays the clarinet .
" they love music , but they didn ’ t have many chances to listen to classical music earlier .
but after i started to learn clarinet , they started to love classical music with me ! "
dreaming of a career abroad for horn player long , classical music has become the passion of his life .
" i want to become a professional horn player , " he said .
" and i really want to work abroad and study abroad and then play music – especially for germans ! "
no wonder that long was euphoric : last sunday ’ s concert at bonn ’ s beethovenhalle was packed – although it was the same evening when the results of germany ’ s general elections were announced .
many germans in the audience were particularly impressed by the works of two vietnamese composers that the students also played – among them a composition commissioned by deutsche welle for the occasion , tran manh hung ’ s " poem symphony " .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

yet things are looking a little better than they did this summer , according to the imf .
" the recovery has started .
financial markets are healing , " imf chief economist olivier blanchard told reporters in istanbul , where leaders from the imf and world bank are gathering for annual meetings .
the global economy will contract 1.1 percent this year , but will grow 3.1 percent in 2010 , according to the imf .
that is better than figures released by the imf in july , in which it forecast a 1.4-percent contraction in 2009 and 2.5-percent growth in 2010 .
governments warned against abandoning stimulus measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf expects weak growth in the euro zone but blanchard warned that the current numbers " should not fool governments into thinking the crisis is over . "
public spending , not private consumption , has kept many economies going during the past year .
the imf warned that governments should not pull back on stimulus measures too early .
for the crisis to end , there needs to be an upsurge in private demand , something which is " clearly going to be a challenge for advanced countries , " said blanchard .
economy will shrink in 2009 imf chief dominique strauss-kahn echoed this cautious optimism in a speech to students in istanbul . " the good news ... is that in our view the recovery really has started .
that does not mean , and i want to be crystal clear on this , that the crisis is over , " he told students in a speech in istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans splurge this christmas ?
the euro zone is expected to grow just 0.3 percent in 2010 and could face unemployment of nearly 12 percent by the end of 2011 .
the jobless rate in the united states is expected to peak at 10.1 percent next year , according to the imf .
" the delay between growth resuming and the peak of unemployment can be ... as much as 14 months .
until unemployment will decrease , it 's difficult to say that the crisis is over .
it 's too early to crow victory , " strauss-kahn said .
asia leads the way growth rates globally will remain relatively weak in the upcoming years , according to the report .
the world economy is expected to grow 4 percent annually between 2010 and 2014 .
that 's down from a 5 percent annual growth rate before the economic downturn .
asia is expected to lead the recovery , with developing countries ' economies predicted to grow 4.7 percent in 2010 .
china is expected to hit an 8.5 percent in 2009 and 9 percent next year .
the outlook is not as bright for advanced economies such as the united states , europe and japan , which will have an average growth rate of 1.3 percent in 2010. th / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .
the private insurers decided the required investment of 360 million euros -lrb- $ 524 million -rrb- was too risky. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iran 's nuclear ambitions western nations must get china on board on iran issue iaea denies allegations of iran cover-up highly symbolic meeting with world powers puts pressure on iran iran refuses to bow to west , accuses us of forging intelligence iran -pipe- 01.10.2009 experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi confirmed a previously undisclosed enrichment site this week told western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .

iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .

" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2009 eu finance ministers debate how to pay for stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu finance ministers are wary of debt as recession ends nations across the european union have pumped billions into stimulus programs designed at boosting economic growth during the global recession .
now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iran 's nuclear ambitions western nations must get china on board on iran issue iaea denies allegations of iran cover-up highly symbolic meeting with world powers puts pressure on iran iran refuses to bow to west , accuses us of forging intelligence iran -pipe- 01.10.2009 experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi confirmed a previously undisclosed enrichment site this week told western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .

that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .
but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .

now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.10.2009 health insurance e-cards stir debate over new era of health care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new electronic health insurance cards can store patients health files on embedded chips a pilot program for chip-embedded health insurance cards has kicked off in the north rhine region .
but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .
the private insurers decided the required investment of 360 million euros -lrb- $ 524 million -rrb- was too risky. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .
but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .

andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.10.2009 health insurance e-cards stir debate over new era of health care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new electronic health insurance cards can store patients health files on embedded chips a pilot program for chip-embedded health insurance cards has kicked off in the north rhine region .
but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .
the private insurers decided the required investment of 360 million euros -lrb- $ 524 million -rrb- was too risky. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .
the private insurers decided the required investment of 360 million euros -lrb- $ 524 million -rrb- was too risky. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .

it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .

the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .

the sun has supported the labour party since 1997 , when tony blair led the party to victory in the polls over the conservatives .
ahead of next year 's elections , however , the sun has changed its tone .
" twelve years ago , britain was crying out for change from a divided , exhausted government .
today we are there again , " said the paper in an article with the headline " labour 's lost it . "
party united after sun 's attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony woodley called on britons to join him in ripping up the sun some analysts say the loss of the sun 's support has actually united the party , and members showed solidarity during the conference . tony woodley , leader of the unite union which helps fund labour , tore up a copy of the sun during a passionate speech at the conference , saying " i suggest the rest of the country should do the exact same thing . "
while the sun 's decision to back cameron and the conservatives may provide a rallying point for the labour party , it might not be enough to save them .
the latest polls released this week in britain show labour in third place with 24 percent .
they trail the liberal democrats by 1 percent but are well behind the conservatives , who polled 36 percent .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 01.10.2009 germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic interests play a major role in europe 's relations to china communist china was founded 60 years ago , bringing an end to a decades-long civil war .
it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

but by the end of the meeting , the labour party is at a new low and without a long time ally , british daily the sun . just after gordon brown struck a deep chord within his labour party during an address on tuesday , one of the party 's biggest supporters over the last three elections pulled the rug out from under his feet .
the sun , britain 's top-selling newspaper , withdrew its support for brown and the labour party in favor of the conservative party and its leader david cameron .
the sun has supported the labour party since 1997 , when tony blair led the party to victory in the polls over the conservatives .
ahead of next year 's elections , however , the sun has changed its tone .

"
while the sun 's decision to back cameron and the conservatives may provide a rallying point for the labour party , it might not be enough to save them .
the latest polls released this week in britain show labour in third place with 24 percent .
they trail the liberal democrats by 1 percent but are well behind the conservatives , who polled 36 percent .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .
many countries fear the enriched uranium could be used for making a nuclear weapon. sac / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .

targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .
many countries fear the enriched uranium could be used for making a nuclear weapon. sac / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their two concerts were a special experience for the students - like french horn player vong ngoc long , who is only 20 years old .
" i love the audience " , said long .
" the way they clap , the way they listen to the music and the critiques after the concert !
so , so nice !
it ’ s a very professional hall to play , so i really loved to play here .

no wonder that long was euphoric : last sunday ’ s concert at bonn ’ s beethovenhalle was packed – although it was the same evening when the results of germany ’ s general elections were announced .
many germans in the audience were particularly impressed by the works of two vietnamese composers that the students also played – among them a composition commissioned by deutsche welle for the occasion , tran manh hung ’ s " poem symphony " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.10.2009 bundesliga a cutthroat place for coaches , but not as tough as southern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucien favre should avoid job offers from spain and italy the sacking of hertha berlin 's lucien favre this week again turns the spotlight on the perceived raw deals dealt to bundesliga coaches .
but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .
but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .

andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .

but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .

but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .

this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .

but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

yet things are looking a little better than they did this summer , according to the imf .
" the recovery has started .
financial markets are healing , " imf chief economist olivier blanchard told reporters in istanbul , where leaders from the imf and world bank are gathering for annual meetings .
the global economy will contract 1.1 percent this year , but will grow 3.1 percent in 2010 , according to the imf .
that is better than figures released by the imf in july , in which it forecast a 1.4-percent contraction in 2009 and 2.5-percent growth in 2010 .
governments warned against abandoning stimulus measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf expects weak growth in the euro zone but blanchard warned that the current numbers " should not fool governments into thinking the crisis is over . "
public spending , not private consumption , has kept many economies going during the past year .
the imf warned that governments should not pull back on stimulus measures too early .
for the crisis to end , there needs to be an upsurge in private demand , something which is " clearly going to be a challenge for advanced countries , " said blanchard .
economy will shrink in 2009 imf chief dominique strauss-kahn echoed this cautious optimism in a speech to students in istanbul . " the good news ... is that in our view the recovery really has started .
that does not mean , and i want to be crystal clear on this , that the crisis is over , " he told students in a speech in istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans splurge this christmas ?
the euro zone is expected to grow just 0.3 percent in 2010 and could face unemployment of nearly 12 percent by the end of 2011 .
the jobless rate in the united states is expected to peak at 10.1 percent next year , according to the imf .
" the delay between growth resuming and the peak of unemployment can be ... as much as 14 months .
until unemployment will decrease , it 's difficult to say that the crisis is over .
it 's too early to crow victory , " strauss-kahn said .
asia leads the way growth rates globally will remain relatively weak in the upcoming years , according to the report .
the world economy is expected to grow 4 percent annually between 2010 and 2014 .
that 's down from a 5 percent annual growth rate before the economic downturn .
asia is expected to lead the recovery , with developing countries ' economies predicted to grow 4.7 percent in 2010 .
china is expected to hit an 8.5 percent in 2009 and 9 percent next year .
the outlook is not as bright for advanced economies such as the united states , europe and japan , which will have an average growth rate of 1.3 percent in 2010. th / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iran 's nuclear ambitions western nations must get china on board on iran issue iaea denies allegations of iran cover-up highly symbolic meeting with world powers puts pressure on iran iran refuses to bow to west , accuses us of forging intelligence iran -pipe- 01.10.2009 experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi confirmed a previously undisclosed enrichment site this week told western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2009 eu finance ministers debate how to pay for stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu finance ministers are wary of debt as recession ends nations across the european union have pumped billions into stimulus programs designed at boosting economic growth during the global recession .
now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .
the private insurers decided the required investment of 360 million euros -lrb- $ 524 million -rrb- was too risky. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .
the private insurers decided the required investment of 360 million euros -lrb- $ 524 million -rrb- was too risky. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but by the end of the meeting , the labour party is at a new low and without a long time ally , british daily the sun . just after gordon brown struck a deep chord within his labour party during an address on tuesday , one of the party 's biggest supporters over the last three elections pulled the rug out from under his feet .
the sun , britain 's top-selling newspaper , withdrew its support for brown and the labour party in favor of the conservative party and its leader david cameron .
the sun has supported the labour party since 1997 , when tony blair led the party to victory in the polls over the conservatives .
ahead of next year 's elections , however , the sun has changed its tone .
" twelve years ago , britain was crying out for change from a divided , exhausted government .
today we are there again , " said the paper in an article with the headline " labour 's lost it . "

"
while the sun 's decision to back cameron and the conservatives may provide a rallying point for the labour party , it might not be enough to save them .
the latest polls released this week in britain show labour in third place with 24 percent .
they trail the liberal democrats by 1 percent but are well behind the conservatives , who polled 36 percent .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

this year ’ s partners for the so-called orchestra campus organized by the deutsche welle and the beethovenfest came from hanoi . young musicians from vietnam , performing ludwig van beethoven ’ s coriolan overture : the orchestra of the national academy of music hanoi was in bonn for a week for the beethovenfest , a yearly music festival dedicated to the famous german composer who was born here .
their two concerts were a special experience for the students - like french horn player vong ngoc long , who is only 20 years old .
" i love the audience " , said long .
" the way they clap , the way they listen to the music and the critiques after the concert !
so , so nice !
it ’ s a very professional hall to play , so i really loved to play here .
maybe i was a little bit too nervous , because i played beethoven ’ s music .
germans know it very well , so i was very nervous .
but i think we did our best and had a lot of fun . "
an exotic choice in the so-called orchestra campus , the young vietnamese worked with european conductors to prepare their concerts .
they stayed with host families .
western music , including jazz , is becoming more and more popular in vietnam .
but it still remains somewhat exotic .
for many of the young musicians , classical music wasn ’ t the obvious choice .
" no one in my family plays classical music , " said 26-year-old quang , who plays the clarinet .
" they love music , but they didn ’ t have many chances to listen to classical music earlier .
but after i started to learn clarinet , they started to love classical music with me ! "
dreaming of a career abroad for horn player long , classical music has become the passion of his life .
" i want to become a professional horn player , " he said .
" and i really want to work abroad and study abroad and then play music – especially for germans ! "
no wonder that long was euphoric : last sunday ’ s concert at bonn ’ s beethovenhalle was packed – although it was the same evening when the results of germany ’ s general elections were announced .
many germans in the audience were particularly impressed by the works of two vietnamese composers that the students also played – among them a composition commissioned by deutsche welle for the occasion , tran manh hung ’ s " poem symphony " .

the sun , britain 's top-selling newspaper , withdrew its support for brown and the labour party in favor of the conservative party and its leader david cameron .
the sun has supported the labour party since 1997 , when tony blair led the party to victory in the polls over the conservatives .

"
while the sun 's decision to back cameron and the conservatives may provide a rallying point for the labour party , it might not be enough to save them .
the latest polls released this week in britain show labour in third place with 24 percent .
they trail the liberal democrats by 1 percent but are well behind the conservatives , who polled 36 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iran 's nuclear ambitions western nations must get china on board on iran issue iaea denies allegations of iran cover-up highly symbolic meeting with world powers puts pressure on iran iran refuses to bow to west , accuses us of forging intelligence iran -pipe- 01.10.2009 experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi confirmed a previously undisclosed enrichment site this week told western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

dw-world.de germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert .
-lrb- 29.09.2009 -rrb- international concern after iran missile tests western nations have widely condemned iran 's latest missile tests .

german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .

and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .

the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .

" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .

the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.10.2009 health insurance e-cards stir debate over new era of health care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new electronic health insurance cards can store patients health files on embedded chips a pilot program for chip-embedded health insurance cards has kicked off in the north rhine region .
but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 01.10.2009 social democrats decide against left coalition in thuringia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is gaining ground in germany , but has no partners as calls mount for a policy change , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in thuringia have decided against a shift toward the left party .
instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

yet things are looking a little better than they did this summer , according to the imf .
" the recovery has started .
financial markets are healing , " imf chief economist olivier blanchard told reporters in istanbul , where leaders from the imf and world bank are gathering for annual meetings .
the global economy will contract 1.1 percent this year , but will grow 3.1 percent in 2010 , according to the imf .
that is better than figures released by the imf in july , in which it forecast a 1.4-percent contraction in 2009 and 2.5-percent growth in 2010 .
governments warned against abandoning stimulus measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf expects weak growth in the euro zone but blanchard warned that the current numbers " should not fool governments into thinking the crisis is over . "
public spending , not private consumption , has kept many economies going during the past year .
the imf warned that governments should not pull back on stimulus measures too early .
for the crisis to end , there needs to be an upsurge in private demand , something which is " clearly going to be a challenge for advanced countries , " said blanchard .
economy will shrink in 2009 imf chief dominique strauss-kahn echoed this cautious optimism in a speech to students in istanbul . " the good news ... is that in our view the recovery really has started .
that does not mean , and i want to be crystal clear on this , that the crisis is over , " he told students in a speech in istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans splurge this christmas ?
the euro zone is expected to grow just 0.3 percent in 2010 and could face unemployment of nearly 12 percent by the end of 2011 .
the jobless rate in the united states is expected to peak at 10.1 percent next year , according to the imf .
" the delay between growth resuming and the peak of unemployment can be ... as much as 14 months .
until unemployment will decrease , it 's difficult to say that the crisis is over .
it 's too early to crow victory , " strauss-kahn said .
asia leads the way growth rates globally will remain relatively weak in the upcoming years , according to the report .
the world economy is expected to grow 4 percent annually between 2010 and 2014 .
that 's down from a 5 percent annual growth rate before the economic downturn .
asia is expected to lead the recovery , with developing countries ' economies predicted to grow 4.7 percent in 2010 .
china is expected to hit an 8.5 percent in 2009 and 9 percent next year .
the outlook is not as bright for advanced economies such as the united states , europe and japan , which will have an average growth rate of 1.3 percent in 2010. th / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the global economy will contract 1.1 percent this year , but will grow 3.1 percent in 2010 , according to the imf .
that is better than figures released by the imf in july , in which it forecast a 1.4-percent contraction in 2009 and 2.5-percent growth in 2010 .
governments warned against abandoning stimulus measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf expects weak growth in the euro zone but blanchard warned that the current numbers " should not fool governments into thinking the crisis is over . "
public spending , not private consumption , has kept many economies going during the past year .
the imf warned that governments should not pull back on stimulus measures too early .
for the crisis to end , there needs to be an upsurge in private demand , something which is " clearly going to be a challenge for advanced countries , " said blanchard .
economy will shrink in 2009 imf chief dominique strauss-kahn echoed this cautious optimism in a speech to students in istanbul . " the good news ... is that in our view the recovery really has started .
that does not mean , and i want to be crystal clear on this , that the crisis is over , " he told students in a speech in istanbul .

the euro zone is expected to grow just 0.3 percent in 2010 and could face unemployment of nearly 12 percent by the end of 2011 .
the jobless rate in the united states is expected to peak at 10.1 percent next year , according to the imf .
" the delay between growth resuming and the peak of unemployment can be ... as much as 14 months .
until unemployment will decrease , it 's difficult to say that the crisis is over .
it 's too early to crow victory , " strauss-kahn said .
asia leads the way growth rates globally will remain relatively weak in the upcoming years , according to the report .
the world economy is expected to grow 4 percent annually between 2010 and 2014 .
that 's down from a 5 percent annual growth rate before the economic downturn .
asia is expected to lead the recovery , with developing countries ' economies predicted to grow 4.7 percent in 2010 .
china is expected to hit an 8.5 percent in 2009 and 9 percent next year .
the outlook is not as bright for advanced economies such as the united states , europe and japan , which will have an average growth rate of 1.3 percent in 2010. th / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "

swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 01.10.2009 social democrats decide against left coalition in thuringia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is gaining ground in germany , but has no partners as calls mount for a policy change , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in thuringia have decided against a shift toward the left party .
instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.10.2009 bundesliga a cutthroat place for coaches , but not as tough as southern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucien favre should avoid job offers from spain and italy the sacking of hertha berlin 's lucien favre this week again turns the spotlight on the perceived raw deals dealt to bundesliga coaches .
but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .
but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .

but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .

however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .

so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2009 eu finance ministers debate how to pay for stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu finance ministers are wary of debt as recession ends nations across the european union have pumped billions into stimulus programs designed at boosting economic growth during the global recession .
now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 01.10.2009 social democrats decide against left coalition in thuringia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is gaining ground in germany , but has no partners as calls mount for a policy change , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in thuringia have decided against a shift toward the left party .
instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.10.2009 eu finance ministers debate how to pay for stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu finance ministers are wary of debt as recession ends nations across the european union have pumped billions into stimulus programs designed at boosting economic growth during the global recession .
now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .

but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .

iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .

but by the end of the meeting , the labour party is at a new low and without a long time ally , british daily the sun . just after gordon brown struck a deep chord within his labour party during an address on tuesday , one of the party 's biggest supporters over the last three elections pulled the rug out from under his feet .
the sun , britain 's top-selling newspaper , withdrew its support for brown and the labour party in favor of the conservative party and its leader david cameron .
the sun has supported the labour party since 1997 , when tony blair led the party to victory in the polls over the conservatives .
ahead of next year 's elections , however , the sun has changed its tone .
" twelve years ago , britain was crying out for change from a divided , exhausted government .

"
while the sun 's decision to back cameron and the conservatives may provide a rallying point for the labour party , it might not be enough to save them .
the latest polls released this week in britain show labour in third place with 24 percent .
they trail the liberal democrats by 1 percent but are well behind the conservatives , who polled 36 percent .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.10.2009 bundesliga a cutthroat place for coaches , but not as tough as southern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucien favre should avoid job offers from spain and italy the sacking of hertha berlin 's lucien favre this week again turns the spotlight on the perceived raw deals dealt to bundesliga coaches .
but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .
but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .

last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .

stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .

china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .
many countries fear the enriched uranium could be used for making a nuclear weapon. sac / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .
many countries fear the enriched uranium could be used for making a nuclear weapon. sac / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics of the transition are putting pressure on politicians to halt the introduction of the new card . the german health insurance card has entered the 21st century .
the so-called e-card , complete with color photo and memory chip , was launched on thursday in the north rhine pilot area .
by the end of the year up to 120,000 publicly insured patients are set to receive the new cards .
supporters say the e-cards will prevent drugs with dangerous interactions from being prescribed by two different doctors , cut down on redundant treatments and give doctors , clinicians and pharmacists access to the same electronic patient file .
" better and cheaper " " the electronic health insurance card gives us the opportunity to make health care better and cheaper at the same time , " said august-wilhelm scheer , president of bitkom , germany 's information and telecommunications industry association .
the photo is meant to make it more difficult for the card to be used by someone other than its owner .
according to scheer , the card also lays " the foundation for a secure handling of sensitive patient data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files stored on health insurance e-cards could save lives or they could be abused some doctors disagree , and while the electronic health insurance card is meant to be in the wallets of all of the 70 million publicly insured in germany by the end of 2010 , there are moves to stop the program before it even gets going .
" gigantic data monster " martin grauduszus , president of the independent doctors association , said the program creates a " gigantic data monster . "
grauduszus and others are concerned about physician-patient confidentiality and the doctor 's right to prescribe medication as he or she sees most fit .
the free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which is sceptical about data-gathering , had opposed the new cards during its election campaign .
now the fdp is set to be the junior partner in a coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
on wednesday grauduszus sent a letter to fdp head guido westerwelle asking him not to forget that " many doctors are pinning their hopes on the fdp . "
" we doctors hope that this opposition will become actual policy , " grauduszus wrote .
off to a rocky start there are other challenges ahead for those pushing for the full implementation of the electronic health insurance card .
those who do get the chip-enabled card have been encouraged to keep their old card with them too when they head to the doctor .
as few as one third of the roughly 15,000 doctor 's offices in the north rhine region have the necessary device to read the new cards .
and those in germany who have opted for private insurance wo n't be affected by these changes at all .
the private insurers decided the required investment of 360 million euros -lrb- $ 524 million -rrb- was too risky. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , it 's time to consider the bill . the national debt in most european union countries has grown excessively thanks to stimulus spending and the worldwide recession .
in the eu , 20 out of 27 nations have a national debt that is over 3 percent of their gross domestic product .
that falls outside the limit that eu leaders set to keep public debts from getting out of control .
some nations are already well on their way to loss of control : ireland 's deficit is nearly 10 percent of its gdp .
germany 's deficit is better than that , but it is still around 4 percent .
normally , the european commission could sanction any countries which use the euro currency and which fail to bring their budgets within the 3 percent stability pact .
but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

but jean-claude juncker , president of the euro group , says these are exceptional times .
" we think that the stability pact should be applied in a flexible way , " he said at a meeting of eu finance ministers in goteborg , sweden , on thursday .
" that means in times of weak growth or recession it should n't be applied too strictly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker calls for patience before issuing debt sanctions plans to stop stimulus spending while governments will have more time to lower their national debts , paying back the deficit wo n't happen automatically .
swedish finance minister and eu council president anders borg says now is the time to start planning for a debt reduction , even though the recession is not officially over .
" the economic situation , i think , is clearly moving ahead to a tentative recovery , " borg said .
" at the same time , this is the time to start deciding and communicating exit strategies . "
one of the biggest steps towards lowering national debt will be scaling back and eventually phasing out the stimulus programs , which are responsible for much of the public debt in europe .
however , some nations still feel that their economies are still too weak to survive without stimulus spending .

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .

there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .

if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iran 's nuclear ambitions western nations must get china on board on iran issue iaea denies allegations of iran cover-up highly symbolic meeting with world powers puts pressure on iran iran refuses to bow to west , accuses us of forging intelligence iran -pipe- 01.10.2009 experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's atomic chief ali akbar salehi confirmed a previously undisclosed enrichment site this week told western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical . as iranian officials and the five permanent security council seat holders - uk , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany have restarted negotiations on thursday after a long hiatus , there were warnings from the united states and european powers that more sanctions could be on the cards if iran refuses to give access to nuclear facilities and freeze sensitive activities .
russia and china , however , have been reluctant to impose more sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
washington has suggested wider sanctions hitting banking and the oil and gas industry if iran , the world 's number five export of crude oil , fails to allay western fears over its nuclear ambitions .
a weapon hard to target but political scientist jochen hippler from the university of duisburg-essen sees little sense in imposing further penalties on tehran .
" there have been sanctions for years .
their degree of effectivity has been around zero . "
targeting sanctions is a major problem , according to the middle east expert .
" i think , in general , sanctions do n't work as they are intended to , unless a country is particularly vulnerable in one particular aspect .
they do n't lead to the desired outcome .
we 've seen that in quite a lot of different countries , " he said .
and such measures tend to hurt the poorer sections of the population far more than those in power .
a poll by worldpublicopinion.org suggests that iranians , indeed , are feeling the pinch .
the survey shows that two-third favor their government precluding the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .
however , only one-third of the 1,003 iranians canvassed said they would be ready to halt uranium enrichment , as a result .
is the world ready for an oil boycott ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has remained defiant more far-reaching radical sanctions , such as a boycott of iranian crude oil exports , would come at a high price for both iran 's population and the world , in general .
" oil is a very sensitive sector for tehran .
iran is economically dependent on crude oil exports to large extent .
it is tool for exerting political pressure .
" but the population would be hit by rising prices and higher unemployment .
it would also pose dangers to the global economy , particularly in a time of crisis like this , " said hippler .
and there is the question of whether the international community really stands united behind these sanctions .
china and russia , in particular , have shown questionable commitment .
time for a different approach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's enrichment program is popular with iranians iran expert konstantin kosten believes it is time for a change of tack .
the 15-member un security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against iran over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
but the first time that the united states imposed economic sanctions against iran was back in 1979 after the iranian revolution .
" iran is completely used to sanctions .
it is iran 's daily bread , " said kosten , from the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" iran has been living under sanctions for thirty years .
the incentive is missing . "
the iran expert stressed the importance of holding further rounds of talks and opening up the dialog to include other topics as well as the nuclear issue , such as the middle east conflict , human rights and iran 's accession to the world trade organization .
" it is very important to make clear to iran and the public as a whole that there are other options .
there should be more focus on the carrot rather than the stick , " said kosten .

the sun , britain 's top-selling newspaper , withdrew its support for brown and the labour party in favor of the conservative party and its leader david cameron .
the sun has supported the labour party since 1997 , when tony blair led the party to victory in the polls over the conservatives .
ahead of next year 's elections , however , the sun has changed its tone .
" twelve years ago , britain was crying out for change from a divided , exhausted government .

"
while the sun 's decision to back cameron and the conservatives may provide a rallying point for the labour party , it might not be enough to save them .
the latest polls released this week in britain show labour in third place with 24 percent .
they trail the liberal democrats by 1 percent but are well behind the conservatives , who polled 36 percent .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .
many countries fear the enriched uranium could be used for making a nuclear weapon. sac / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

but the league 's reputation might be unfair , writes dw 's nick amies . there are few absolutes in life aside from the oft-cited death and taxes .
in soccer management , those brave enough to follow this career path can add sacking to this list .
many believe that from the moment his signature goes onto a contract , the coach is already on borrowed time ; the dug-out becomes a death row cell , with every result either staying his execution or bringing nearer the day when the sporting director utters those ominous words : " the coach has the board 's full backing " ... and then delivers the killer blow anyway soon after .
while players fight for their place in the starting line-up on a weekly basis , each game sees the coach battling for his job ; his reputation and job security are only as good as the results he can string together .
very few coaches enjoy immunity from this constant fight for life - and those who do have often been on the brink of being shown the door before a period of success buys them some breathing space .
the bundesliga often comes under the spotlight because of its clubs ' perceived impatience with managers .
german clubs seem to favor early sackings , perhaps reflecting the cultural characteristics of efficiency and bluntness .
the germans seem to believe that if someone is n't working out , it 's better to cut them loose sooner rather than later .
this gives the affected club more time to find someone capable of putting things right before the damage becomes irreparable .
so far this season , the bundesliga has seen three such sackings by clubs wanting to make changes before the season - and possibly their top flight status - is lost .
mainz , bochum and hertha berlin have cut their bosses loose before the season is even two months old .
-lrb- hanover 's cutting of its ties to dieter hecking was officially through the coach 's resignation , but then again o.j. simpson is officially an innocent man . -rrb- fast-sacking reputation brands bundesliga ruthless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann lasted longer than many coaches last season the hair-trigger approach has given the bundesliga a reputation for being one of the most hostile environments for coaches in european soccer .
but in truth , far from being the most cold-blooded when it comes to managerial assassinations , the bundesliga rates among the lowest for coaching casualties among the top european leagues over a full season .
last season , five coaches were given the bullet , a rating in line with the english premiership - one of the most high-pressure leagues in europe , if not the world .
of those five bundesliga coaches fired , two of them were early casualties at clubs looking to change the guard before it was too late .
stuttgart 's armin veh and borussia moenchengladbach 's jos luhukay were jobless by christmas , while schalke 's fred rutten lasted until march when it then became clear that he was the latest in a long line of coaches unable to steer the gelsenkirchen club to championship success .
bayern munich 's patience with juergen klinsmann finally ran out in april , while a dismal season which ended in last place and relegation cost michael frontzeck his job at arminia bielefeld in may - bizarrely enough , with only one match left in the season .
chances are , though , that these coaches would have been shown just as little mercy outside the bundesliga - and if they had been working in spain or italy , they may well have been kept on an even shorter leash .
more spanish coaches feel the sword bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schuster was sacked by real madrid before christmas like so many toro bravo trotted out for slaughter in the las ventas bullring in madrid , ten coaches felt the matador 's sword in the 2008/09 edition of la liga , double the number in germany .
five coaches were looking for work before the new year while the other five sackings were scattered throughout the season 's second half .
espanyol actually sacked a coach either side of christmas , regretting their appointments twice in one season .
however , despite the ruthless culling of coaches in spain , la liga did not top the sacking charts in europe last season .
in italy , a grand total of 12 coaches woke up with a horse 's head on the pillow beside them , making serie a the most unforgiving league among europe 's elite in the 2008/09 campaign .
italy tops the list of hazardous coaching environments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being " campioni " did n't save mancini 's job at inter as in spain , the sackings were equally divided between the season 's two halves .
six coaches , including roberto mancini , the boss at reigning champions inter milan , were sleeping with the fishes before the tinsel was up , while the other half-dozen were picked off by swarthy types in fedoras and raincoats by the season 's end .
trumping the spanish in another area , three clubs - bologna , torino and reggina - sacked two coaches within ten months .
-lrb- reggina actually went through both of theirs in just over six weeks . -rrb-
so while germany may have the reputation for swift and early kills , when it comes to working and playing for your job , the bundesliga is considerably less hazardous that its southern european counterparts .

yet things are looking a little better than they did this summer , according to the imf .
" the recovery has started .
financial markets are healing , " imf chief economist olivier blanchard told reporters in istanbul , where leaders from the imf and world bank are gathering for annual meetings .
the global economy will contract 1.1 percent this year , but will grow 3.1 percent in 2010 , according to the imf .
that is better than figures released by the imf in july , in which it forecast a 1.4-percent contraction in 2009 and 2.5-percent growth in 2010 .
governments warned against abandoning stimulus measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf expects weak growth in the euro zone but blanchard warned that the current numbers " should not fool governments into thinking the crisis is over . "
public spending , not private consumption , has kept many economies going during the past year .
the imf warned that governments should not pull back on stimulus measures too early .
for the crisis to end , there needs to be an upsurge in private demand , something which is " clearly going to be a challenge for advanced countries , " said blanchard .
economy will shrink in 2009 imf chief dominique strauss-kahn echoed this cautious optimism in a speech to students in istanbul . " the good news ... is that in our view the recovery really has started .
that does not mean , and i want to be crystal clear on this , that the crisis is over , " he told students in a speech in istanbul .

the euro zone is expected to grow just 0.3 percent in 2010 and could face unemployment of nearly 12 percent by the end of 2011 .
the jobless rate in the united states is expected to peak at 10.1 percent next year , according to the imf .
" the delay between growth resuming and the peak of unemployment can be ... as much as 14 months .
until unemployment will decrease , it 's difficult to say that the crisis is over .
it 's too early to crow victory , " strauss-kahn said .
asia leads the way growth rates globally will remain relatively weak in the upcoming years , according to the report .
the world economy is expected to grow 4 percent annually between 2010 and 2014 .
that 's down from a 5 percent annual growth rate before the economic downturn .
asia is expected to lead the recovery , with developing countries ' economies predicted to grow 4.7 percent in 2010 .
china is expected to hit an 8.5 percent in 2009 and 9 percent next year .
the outlook is not as bright for advanced economies such as the united states , europe and japan , which will have an average growth rate of 1.3 percent in 2010. th / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 01.10.2009 social democrats decide against left coalition in thuringia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is gaining ground in germany , but has no partners as calls mount for a policy change , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in thuringia have decided against a shift toward the left party .
instead they have opted for a governing coalition with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . following weeks of speculation , the spd in thuringia announced on thursday that they would be seeking a governing coalition with the conservatives rather than a three-way alliance with the left party and the greens .
" we are convinced that this coalition is the more stable option , " said spd leader in thuringia christoph matschie .
the move is consistent with the social democrats ' federal policy of shunning the left party , canceling out what would have been the first three-way coalition between the spd , the left party and the greens at state level .
instead it is now playing the part of kingmaker for the strongest party in the thuringian state parliament , the conservative cdu , leaving the post of thuringian state premier to the party 's christine lieberknecht .
bildunterschrift : lieberknecht is set to take the helm in thuringia " i am relieved and grateful that the spd came to this decision after long deliberations .
we had hoped for this outcome in the interest of the state , " said lieberknecht .
the left party slammed the decision , which forces it to take to the opposition benches yet again .
" the spd is not going with the times .
the voter is being cheated by this move .
i hope voters in the next election will decide that this party -lsb- the sdp -rsb- is finished in thuringia and that politics with them is no longer possible , " said knut korschewsky , the left party 's state chairman in thuringia . " in bed with the cdu " in thuringian state elections on august 30 , the cdu took 31.2 percent , just ahead of the left party at 27.4 percent .
since the cdu and the left 's policy are irreconcilable , it was virtually left to the third-placed spd , at 18.5 percent , to decide who would lead thuringia 's new government .
analysts say three-way coalition talks did not fail over political issues but rather on personnel issues , with the spd and the left at loggerheads over nominating a new state premier .
though the spd had come a distant third in the election , it was not prepared to cede leadership to the second-placed left party .
" matschie used the negotiations to focus on topic of dissent in order to get into bed with the cdu , " said korschewsky .
the coalition twist in thuringia has further fuelled the debate about where the spd is heading following the catastrophic results in last weekend 's general election .
the social democrats earned only 23 percent - the party 's lowest election returns in postwar history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie was not willing to cede leadership to any other party than the cdu spd losing ground to left party the spd has been struggling to hold on to its voter basis ever since the left party entered the political theater and claimed the left sphere for itself .
the party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with the left federally .
however , at state level this has been considered an altogether different case , especially in eastern germany where the left party 's standing is far stronger than in the west .
in thuringia , a coalition would have been possible , and some within the spd openly favored a left alliance over a coalition with the conservatives .
" the left party actually is a suitable coalition partner for the spd .
however , it is problematic if the spd has to cede leadership to the left which would in the long-term demote it to a mere a satellite , " micheal luehmann , a political analyst from the university of goettingen told deutsche welle .
" with the conservatives moving more strongly toward the center-left of the political spectrum , the spd is running the risk of being squashed between the left party and the cdu , a process which we have been seeing in saxony and thuringia for almost 20 years now , " added luehmann .
clearly the spd is not ready to join forces with the left party - and in some parts of germany , it may never be .
so far , the one party to benefit from this policy is the cdu , which - despite unconvincing election results - is on track for another term in government in thuringia .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .
students who called themselves the " red guards " were sent to the countryside to implement the revolution 's ideals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red guards terrorized peasants in the countryside europe 's youth , in particular the 1968 student movement , was fascinated by china and maoism .
china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol gave mao the pop treatment but things started to change in the 1970s .
west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .
in the 1980s , china developed extremely quickly because of deng xiaoping 's economic reforms .
it became even more interesting as a market .
german companies began establishing ties to china .
in 1985 , volkswagen was the first western automaker to open a plant in shanghai .
there were signs of political liberalization and hope for reforms .
but china was not only fascinating from an economic point of view , said sinologist tilman spengler .
" it was a pleasantly unostentatious time , " spengler said .
" lots of westerners liked the fact that people cycled instead of driving .
the fact that they were doing this out of necessity and not because they wanted to was another matter . "
spengler said there was an idea that this developing country might not repeat the same mistakes that had been made elsewhere .
events of 1989 sparked disappointment and helplessness when the students demonstrated in tiananmen square in 1989 , the whole world had its eyes on beijing .
but the euphoria did not last .
the country 's leadership steamrolled the protests under tank tracks .
the world was shocked .
many western countries , including germany , to a large extent froze relations .
spengler said anyone who dealt with china at the time felt helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in 1989 were short lived " you simply did n't go there any more and that was it , " he said .
instead , sinologists increasingly turned to historical topics , he said .
" then you did n't have to shake anyone 's hand that had to do with the whole thing . "
but the state of shock did n't last long .
relations soon thawed .
china 's economic development had long developed its own pull .
in 1995 , chancellor helmut kohl went to china and came back with deals worth billions .
but he had to justify his trip to the critics at home .
" i do n't think that the course of economic reform can be reversed , " kohl said .
" i am sure that once again we will see that economic reforms can have an impact on other areas of politics as we have seen elsewhere in recent history .
i am absolutely certain they will lead to more political freedom and more regard for human rights . "
his successor gerhard schroeder was of the same opinion .
only under angela merkel have human rights once again became an important part of germany 's china policy - but not to the detriment of economic interests .
twenty years after the massacre at tiananmen square , germany 's relationship with china remains ambivalent .
it is caught between moral outrage at human rights violations and a fascination for the country 's economic rise .

it has gradually returned to the international stage .
but germany has grappled with finding the right approach to the country . when mao zedong announced the foundation of the people 's republic of china in beijing 's tiananmen square in 1949 , the west was shocked .
it was the cold war , and now there were 600 million people on the other side - with the communists .
once again , there was talk of the " yellow peril " which had already made the rounds at the beginning of the 20th century .
but this time , the peril was red .
" i can only say : china , china , china , " said kurt georg kiesinger , germany 's chancellor in the late 1960s , referring to western nations ' perception that china was a possible threat . at the same time , the west had already intently noted the break between the soviet union and china at the beginning of the 1960s .
china suddenly became part of the strategic equation , particularly with moscow in mind .
" it could be that in the not too distant future , russia will have to make a decision : should i reach an agreement with red china , or with western europe and the united states ? " said konrad adenauer , germany 's chancellor at the time .
grassroots communism fascinating for western leftists in china , meanwhile , the cultural revolution was underway .

china had became an object of interest for leftists as a result of its discord with the soviet union .
many of the rebelling students in europe felt inspired by the events in china .
sociologist herbert marcuse , one of the foremost intellectuals of the time , said this new form of communism in china would be based less on central economic planning and more on mass campaigns .
" this is a new communism - grassroots communism , if you like , " marcuse said .
" perhaps it has very different possibilities than the communism that has developed in the soviet union . "
according to marcuse , this " third world communism " would be much more dangerous to capitalism than the soviet model of marxism .
relations thawed in the 1970s mao 's little red book could be found in the homes of many western students during this era .
andy warhol transformed the leader of the chinese revolution into a pop icon .
nevertheless , few people had an inkling of what was really going on in china beyond the propaganda , as western visitors were not allowed to travel there .

west germany established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic in 1972 .
chancellor helmut schmidt in 1975 became the first german head of government to visit beijing .
upon his return , schmidt told german television about his trip and meeting with the already critically ill mao zedong .
he called china " a fascinating country " that had a lot of catching up to do in terms of economic development .
" yet , it has been an advanced civilization for over 3,000 years , whereas we have been so for a much shorter time , " schmidt said .

he was vice president of the german parliament from 1994-1998 .
dw : has the west overestimated iran 's willingness to negotiate ?
hans-ulrich klose : that depends what you mean by the west .
if one talks about the so-called eu-3 -lsb- britain , france , germany -rsb- they have tried for years to achieve results with iran through negotiations .
the eu-3 have always been realistic .
they knew that negotiations with iran could only be successful if on a certain point - namely security - the us would participate in the negotiations .
this was n't the case before obama .
but it is noteworthy , that president obama really was serious when he said during the election campaign that he would also talk to america 's adversaries .
he made an offer to talk that tehran so far has n't shown much appreciation for .
quite to the contrary : after the most recent revelations one has to assume that tehran continues to obfuscate .
iran is sending very mixed messages .
on the one hand the government says it 's ready to cooperate , but on the other hand there are the new revelations about another previously undeclared iranian enrichment site and missile tests .
how should the permanent members of the security council and germany react to this at the talks with iran in geneva on thursday ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says iran seems to be playing for time to be honest , i do n't really know myself .
one has to consider the possibility that iran continues to play for time until we simply get to a point of no return .
so far it seems like that iran is always playing for time , and i think this is continuing .
that 's why we are getting close to the point where either new and effective sanctions have to be enacted , or other measures have to be put on the table . obama has already threatened tougher sanctions .
but do sanctions make sense ?
some sanctions are already in place .
that really is an open question .
there are in modern history only a few examples in which sanctions were effective .
the only example i can think of is south africa during the apartheid regime .
but that case is n't comparable , because in the south african case the majority of south africans and people around the world supported sanctions .
that is n't the case with iran .
still , sanctions that would isolate iran are thinkable , but only if china and russia take part .
is n't there a danger that other allies might not enforce the sanctions ?
no , i think at this juncture the west is pretty much united .
but the west is n't yet united on the question of what the next measures should be .
the us does n't rule out a military strike against the nuclear sites anymore .
is that the right strategy ?
firstly , it is probably the right that the americans keep all options on the table .
secondly , i do n't think we can solve the problem militarily .
a military conflict with iran could easily get out of control and engulf the entire middle east in flames .
what other options are there then , besides the military one ?
there is an option that is being considered in germany , at least in the think tanks .
that is that one considers the possibility of iran becoming a nuclear power , a military nuclear power .
in that case , we would have to consider a number of implications and it would be better to think about them now instead of waiting until this possibility becomes reality .
what kind of implications would have to be drawn in that case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran confirmed it has a second , previously undisclosed , uranium enrichment plant let 's start with iran .
if iran becomes a nuclear power , the west , possibly together with russia , will have to develop a new security policy , a new deterrence policy , to be precise , that clearly says to the leaders in tehran : " now that you are a nuclear power , if you threaten world peace , the world 's reaction will be nuclear as well .
secondly , a new containment regime has to be established .
thirdly , one has to try to install a new security framework in the gulf region .
for the arab countries that feel threatened by iran , one would need to develop a new nuclear shield - which only the americans could do , possibly including russia .
and one would have to reconsider israel 's security , which would be dramatically altered if iran became a nuclear power .

but the us has warned against tehran stalling . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said iran is likely to open its new enrichment plant to united nations nuclear watchdog inspectors within a few weeks .
" iran has told us that it plans to cooperate fully and immediately with the international atomic energy agency on the new enrichment facility near qom , " solana told a press conference in geneva on thursday .
he was speaking after talks on iran 's nuclear program between iran and the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany .
an iaea spokeswoman confirmed that the organization 's director-general mohamed elbaradei will visit iran at the invitation of the iranian authorities .
" he will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters , " spokeswoman gill tudor said in a statement .
a diplomat close to the iaea , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agency afp that the invitation was " undeniably a gesture from iran " toward the west in the standoff over its nuclear program .
the talks , in an 18th century villa overlooking lake geneva , marked a shift in relations .
they were the first official high-level meeting of the us and iran since the islamic revolution and the hostage crisis in tehran in 1979 .
solana said it was important that the united states had participated fully in such talks for the first time .
stalling will bring sanctions iran 's negotiator saeed jalili said " good " discussions had taken place .
but in washington , us president barack obama warned that us patience was not unlimited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns and jalili reportedly got on quite well at the talks obama said iran has a path to better relations with the international community .
it must now take steps to ensure its nuclear program is not for weapons , he said .
" the iranian government heard a clear and unified message from the international community in geneva , " obama said .
" iran must demonstrate through concrete steps that it will live up to its responsibilities with respect to its nuclear program . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton said earlier thursday she wanted iran to take concrete actions .
" it was a productive day , but the proof of that has not yet come to fruition , " clinton told reporters in washington .
clinton said she had discussed details of the meeting with william burns , her envoy in geneva , but did not share them with reporters .
further talks to take place soon solana , who formally represented the security council 's european veto powers and germany at the talks , said a further meeting was planned .
the next round of talks would take place before the end of october , he said .
" we agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks , " he said .
he added that " this is only a start . "
" we shall need to see progress on some of the practical steps we discussed today , " solana said .
there was also partial progress in discussing with iran the possibility of enriching its uranium outside of the country .
solana said the world powers and iran had agreed in principle on iranian uranium being sent to a third country to be enriched and used for a research reactor in tehran .
however , solana said there was " not a complete response " from iran about the six powers ' offer of refraining from new sanctions , in return for iran not expanding its enrichment program .
many countries fear the enriched uranium could be used for making a nuclear weapon. sac / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials now say at least 200 bodies have been found from the earlier 7.6 magnitude quake , which triggered landslides and cut power lines .
hundreds of buildings , including hospitals , collapsed in padang , the capital of west sumatra province .
rescue workers said the number of dead is expected to rise significantly .
" our prediction is that thousands have died , " said rustam pakaya , head of the health ministry 's disaster centre in jakarta .
heavy machinery the first earthquake struck at 1716 local time -lrb- 1016 gmt -rrb- on wednesday , some 85km -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- under the sea , north-west of padang , the us geological survey said .
the second quake was on land and struck at 0852 local time -lrb- 0152 gmt -rrb- on thursday , about 225km south-east of padang at a depth of about 25km .
in pictures : sumatra earthquake quakes weaken faults there were no immediate reports of damage from the second quake .
rescuers have been struggling in heavy rain to try to find survivors from the first quake who are buried under rubble in padang .
a doctor working in the city told the bbc : " there 's quite a few people that have died .
at first i was thinking it was going to be in the hundreds but it 's going to be in the thousands of people that have been crushed or trapped . "
one resident of padang , siti , told reuters news agency : " we need aid as soon as possible .
we need food and medicine .
our houses have collapsed . "
earlier priyadi kardono , a spokesman for indonesia 's national disaster agency , said more than 500 houses and buildings had collapsed .
" many people are staying outdoors and some people are staying in public facilities , " he told reuters .
mr kardono said about 150 military personnel , as well as police and health ministry workers , were in the affected area , but they urgently needed heavy machinery to lift the rubble .
the quake brought down telephone lines , severely affecting communications with the region and making it difficult to assess the scale of the damage .
speaking on wednesday , indonesia 's president susilo bambang yudhoyono said a coordinated relief effort was underway .
he said military planes were flying medical equipment and personnel to the affected region .
burning buildings witnesses to the first quake said residents ran out of buildings in padang - which has a population of 900,000 - and surrounding cities .
major indonesian quakes 26 dec 2004 : asian tsunami kills 170,000 in indonesia alone 28 march 2005 : about 1,300 killed after a magnitude 8.7 quake hits the coast of sumatra 27 may 2006 : quake hits ancient city of yogyakarta , killing 5,000 17 july 2006 : a tsunami after a 7.7 magnitude quake in west java province kills 550 people animated guide : earthquakes jane liddon , an australian businesswoman in padang , told australian radio many large buildings in the town had been severely damaged .
" the concrete buildings are all down , the hospitals , the main markets , down and burned , " she said .
" a lot of people died in there .
a lot of places are burning . "
but ms liddon said many smaller residential properties had escaped the damage .
australia has offered to send emergency assistance to indonesia if needed .
" they are very close friends and neighbours .
they know that we are here and available to help .
they just have to ask , " said aid minister bob mcmullan .
indonesian officials have said the quake was one of the biggest in indonesia in recent years and could have been more powerful than the 2006 yogyakarta quake that killed more then 5,000 people .
wednesday 's quake was along the same fault line that spawned the 2004 asian tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries .
that much more powerful earthquake struck roughly 600km north-west of padang .
geologists have long warned that padang could one day be completely destroyed by an earthquake because of its location .
western sumatra is a mainly rural area with dense tropical forest .
it has several national parks and many of its beaches are popular with surfers .

officials now say at least 200 bodies have been found from the earlier 7.6 magnitude quake , which triggered landslides and cut power lines .
hundreds of buildings , including hospitals , collapsed in padang , the capital of west sumatra province .
rescue workers said the number of dead is expected to rise significantly .
" our prediction is that thousands have died , " said rustam pakaya , head of the health ministry 's disaster centre in jakarta .

rescuers have been struggling in heavy rain to try to find survivors from the first quake who are buried under rubble in padang .
a doctor working in the city told the bbc : " there 's quite a few people that have died .
at first i was thinking it was going to be in the hundreds but it 's going to be in the thousands of people that have been crushed or trapped . "
one resident of padang , siti , told reuters news agency : " we need aid as soon as possible .
we need food and medicine .
our houses have collapsed . "
earlier priyadi kardono , a spokesman for indonesia 's national disaster agency , said more than 500 houses and buildings had collapsed .
" many people are staying outdoors and some people are staying in public facilities , " he told reuters .
mr kardono said about 150 military personnel , as well as police and health ministry workers , were in the affected area , but they urgently needed heavy machinery to lift the rubble .
the quake brought down telephone lines , severely affecting communications with the region and making it difficult to assess the scale of the damage .
speaking on wednesday , indonesia 's president susilo bambang yudhoyono said a coordinated relief effort was underway .
he said military planes were flying medical equipment and personnel to the affected region .
burning buildings witnesses to the first quake said residents ran out of buildings in padang - which has a population of 900,000 - and surrounding cities .

" the concrete buildings are all down , the hospitals , the main markets , down and burned , " she said .
" a lot of people died in there .

australia has offered to send emergency assistance to indonesia if needed .
" they are very close friends and neighbours .
they know that we are here and available to help .
they just have to ask , " said aid minister bob mcmullan .
indonesian officials have said the quake was one of the biggest in indonesia in recent years and could have been more powerful than the 2006 yogyakarta quake that killed more then 5,000 people .
wednesday 's quake was along the same fault line that spawned the 2004 asian tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries .
that much more powerful earthquake struck roughly 600km north-west of padang .
geologists have long warned that padang could one day be completely destroyed by an earthquake because of its location .

it has several national parks and many of its beaches are popular with surfers .
