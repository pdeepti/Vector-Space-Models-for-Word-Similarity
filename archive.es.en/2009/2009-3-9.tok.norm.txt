the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .

later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .

but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities .

calmy-rey warned : " difficulties at ubs could weaken the international finance system . " df / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .
we were n't cold-blooded enough .
the players fought and gave everything but you simply have to take your chances . "
high-flyers now languishing in seventh bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's christoph dabrowski -lrb- l -rrb- puts his team ahead against leverkusen the draw follows two league defeats for leverkusen and leaves them seventh , nine points behind leaders hertha berlin and five adrift of fifth-placed sv hamburg in the nearest uefa cup qualifying place .
bochum are 14th , two points off the relegation zone and a point ahead of arminia bielefeld who played out a goalless draw with visiting eintracht frankfurt .
on saturday , hertha moved to 46 points , four points clear at the top of four teams with a 3-1 win at energie cottbus .
hoffenheim , who drew 0-0 with werder bremen , and bayern munich , who thrashed hanover 5-1 , are joint second , with wolfsburg fourth and hamburg fifth .
wolfsburg claimed a fifth successive league win by defeating karlsruhe 1-0 while hamburg slumped to a 4-1 defeat at struggling borussia moenchengladbach .
bayern goal-fest ideal tonic for the blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski was among the scorers in the 5-1 win bayern 's win was the ideal tonic after their german cup defeat last week and with a seemingly comfortable home leg to negotiate against sporting lisbon in the champions league on tuesday , munich 's season looks far from over .
however , munich coach juergen klinsmann insists his team 's last 16 clash with the portuguese is not a foregone conclusion despite the germans ' huge first-leg advantage .
italian world cup winner luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery both scored two goals in lisbon two weeks ago as bayern hammered their hosts 5-0 in the first leg .
both ribery , who is suffering with a shin complaint , and toni , struggling with an achilles problem , will be missing with injuries for the second leg at munich 's allianz arena .
klinsi cautious ahead of lisbon game and while lisbon face a virtually impossible task if they are to make the quarter-finals , klinsmann insists his side will not sit back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann warns his team not to relax against sporting " it looks a formality on paper , but it 's not .
we can take nothing for granted , " said the ex-germany boss .
" we need to take it seriously and must n't be careless .
that 's something we ca n't afford . "
with several top-name stars missing , klinsmann is likely to use fringe members of his squad against the portuguese .
" it 's the kind of match where we can have a look at one or two players , but we wo n't overdo the rotation .
i want to maintain the flow , " he said .
squad players such as argentina forward jose ernesto sosa , brazilian defender breno , defender andreas ottl and reserve goalkeeper hans joerg butt look set to feature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.03.2009 merkel under pressure as conservatives lose popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worsening economy has made merkel 's job tougher in an election year faced with sliding opinion poll ratings , members of germany 's conservative christian democratic union have urged their leader , chancellor angela merkel , to show stronger leadership six months ahead of a general election . a string of opinion polls released last week showed germany 's conservative bloc , made up of merkel 's christian democratic union or cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , losing popular support .
the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .

sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .

this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .

" as private sector creditors shun emerging markets , only one-quarter of the most vulnerable countries have the resources to prevent a rise in poverty , " the bank said in a statement .
the sharpest trade losses will be in east asia , the bank said , where economies are largely reliant on exports .
zoellick calls for " global solution " since banks and international financial institutions would not be able to shore up developing economies due to the global crisis , world bank president robert zoellick called for " investments in safety nets , infrastructure and small and medium-size companies to create jobs and to avoid social and political unrest . "
" we need to react in real time to a growing crisis that is hurting people in developing countries , " zoellick said .
" this global crisis needs a global solution , and preventing an economic catastrophe in developing countries is important for global efforts to overcome this crisis . "
the bank said the crisis will make poor countries more reliant on development assistance because , as richer countries borrow more , it will become more difficult for poorer countries to raise debt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick has called for global efforts to prevent " social unrest " in poor and developing nations the world bank also warned the growing crisis will push world trade to its steepest decline in 80 years .
industrial output could be as much as 15 percent lower than 2008 , it said .
last month zoellick called for a fund to which wealthier industrial nations would contribute 0.7 percent of their stimulus package to help poorer countries .

the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .

seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .

" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .

meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .
we were n't cold-blooded enough .
the players fought and gave everything but you simply have to take your chances . "

bochum are 14th , two points off the relegation zone and a point ahead of arminia bielefeld who played out a goalless draw with visiting eintracht frankfurt .
on saturday , hertha moved to 46 points , four points clear at the top of four teams with a 3-1 win at energie cottbus .
hoffenheim , who drew 0-0 with werder bremen , and bayern munich , who thrashed hanover 5-1 , are joint second , with wolfsburg fourth and hamburg fifth .
wolfsburg claimed a fifth successive league win by defeating karlsruhe 1-0 while hamburg slumped to a 4-1 defeat at struggling borussia moenchengladbach .

however , munich coach juergen klinsmann insists his team 's last 16 clash with the portuguese is not a foregone conclusion despite the germans ' huge first-leg advantage .
italian world cup winner luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery both scored two goals in lisbon two weeks ago as bayern hammered their hosts 5-0 in the first leg .
both ribery , who is suffering with a shin complaint , and toni , struggling with an achilles problem , will be missing with injuries for the second leg at munich 's allianz arena .

with several top-name stars missing , klinsmann is likely to use fringe members of his squad against the portuguese .
" it 's the kind of match where we can have a look at one or two players , but we wo n't overdo the rotation .
i want to maintain the flow , " he said .
squad players such as argentina forward jose ernesto sosa , brazilian defender breno , defender andreas ottl and reserve goalkeeper hans joerg butt look set to feature .

bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .
we were n't cold-blooded enough .

however , munich coach juergen klinsmann insists his team 's last 16 clash with the portuguese is not a foregone conclusion despite the germans ' huge first-leg advantage .
italian world cup winner luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery both scored two goals in lisbon two weeks ago as bayern hammered their hosts 5-0 in the first leg .

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .

the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities . "
calmy-rey warned : " difficulties at ubs could weaken the international finance system . " df / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .

klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .

later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 09.03.2009 germany : eliminating europe 's tax havens a priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe and the us want banking transparency germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the debate which is raging around banking secrecy in europe .
it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .
" if he makes a confession , if he spares his victims from having to appear here in public , he will get a corresponding reduction ... in his sentence , " anton winkler said . nda / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .
" if he makes a confession , if he spares his victims from having to appear here in public , he will get a corresponding reduction ... in his sentence , " anton winkler said . nda / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .

the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .

"
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .

czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .

but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .

meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .
we were n't cold-blooded enough .
the players fought and gave everything but you simply have to take your chances . "
high-flyers now languishing in seventh bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's christoph dabrowski -lrb- l -rrb- puts his team ahead against leverkusen the draw follows two league defeats for leverkusen and leaves them seventh , nine points behind leaders hertha berlin and five adrift of fifth-placed sv hamburg in the nearest uefa cup qualifying place .
bochum are 14th , two points off the relegation zone and a point ahead of arminia bielefeld who played out a goalless draw with visiting eintracht frankfurt .
on saturday , hertha moved to 46 points , four points clear at the top of four teams with a 3-1 win at energie cottbus .
hoffenheim , who drew 0-0 with werder bremen , and bayern munich , who thrashed hanover 5-1 , are joint second , with wolfsburg fourth and hamburg fifth .
wolfsburg claimed a fifth successive league win by defeating karlsruhe 1-0 while hamburg slumped to a 4-1 defeat at struggling borussia moenchengladbach .
bayern goal-fest ideal tonic for the blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski was among the scorers in the 5-1 win bayern 's win was the ideal tonic after their german cup defeat last week and with a seemingly comfortable home leg to negotiate against sporting lisbon in the champions league on tuesday , munich 's season looks far from over .
however , munich coach juergen klinsmann insists his team 's last 16 clash with the portuguese is not a foregone conclusion despite the germans ' huge first-leg advantage .
italian world cup winner luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery both scored two goals in lisbon two weeks ago as bayern hammered their hosts 5-0 in the first leg .
both ribery , who is suffering with a shin complaint , and toni , struggling with an achilles problem , will be missing with injuries for the second leg at munich 's allianz arena .
klinsi cautious ahead of lisbon game and while lisbon face a virtually impossible task if they are to make the quarter-finals , klinsmann insists his side will not sit back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann warns his team not to relax against sporting " it looks a formality on paper , but it 's not .
we can take nothing for granted , " said the ex-germany boss .
" we need to take it seriously and must n't be careless .
that 's something we ca n't afford . "
with several top-name stars missing , klinsmann is likely to use fringe members of his squad against the portuguese .
" it 's the kind of match where we can have a look at one or two players , but we wo n't overdo the rotation .
i want to maintain the flow , " he said .
squad players such as argentina forward jose ernesto sosa , brazilian defender breno , defender andreas ottl and reserve goalkeeper hans joerg butt look set to feature .
sporting also warmed up for tuesday 's clash with a comfortable win at the weekend .
they beat 12th-placed pacos ferreira 2-0 on saturday courtesy of goals from brazilian strikers liedson and derlei which keeps them in touch with the top of the portuguese league as they remain four points off leaders porto . nda / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.03.2009 merkel under pressure as conservatives lose popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worsening economy has made merkel 's job tougher in an election year faced with sliding opinion poll ratings , members of germany 's conservative christian democratic union have urged their leader , chancellor angela merkel , to show stronger leadership six months ahead of a general election . a string of opinion polls released last week showed germany 's conservative bloc , made up of merkel 's christian democratic union or cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , losing popular support .
the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .
we were n't cold-blooded enough .
the players fought and gave everything but you simply have to take your chances . "
high-flyers now languishing in seventh bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's christoph dabrowski -lrb- l -rrb- puts his team ahead against leverkusen the draw follows two league defeats for leverkusen and leaves them seventh , nine points behind leaders hertha berlin and five adrift of fifth-placed sv hamburg in the nearest uefa cup qualifying place .
bochum are 14th , two points off the relegation zone and a point ahead of arminia bielefeld who played out a goalless draw with visiting eintracht frankfurt .
on saturday , hertha moved to 46 points , four points clear at the top of four teams with a 3-1 win at energie cottbus .
hoffenheim , who drew 0-0 with werder bremen , and bayern munich , who thrashed hanover 5-1 , are joint second , with wolfsburg fourth and hamburg fifth .
wolfsburg claimed a fifth successive league win by defeating karlsruhe 1-0 while hamburg slumped to a 4-1 defeat at struggling borussia moenchengladbach .
bayern goal-fest ideal tonic for the blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski was among the scorers in the 5-1 win bayern 's win was the ideal tonic after their german cup defeat last week and with a seemingly comfortable home leg to negotiate against sporting lisbon in the champions league on tuesday , munich 's season looks far from over .
however , munich coach juergen klinsmann insists his team 's last 16 clash with the portuguese is not a foregone conclusion despite the germans ' huge first-leg advantage .
italian world cup winner luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery both scored two goals in lisbon two weeks ago as bayern hammered their hosts 5-0 in the first leg .
both ribery , who is suffering with a shin complaint , and toni , struggling with an achilles problem , will be missing with injuries for the second leg at munich 's allianz arena .
klinsi cautious ahead of lisbon game and while lisbon face a virtually impossible task if they are to make the quarter-finals , klinsmann insists his side will not sit back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann warns his team not to relax against sporting " it looks a formality on paper , but it 's not .
we can take nothing for granted , " said the ex-germany boss .
" we need to take it seriously and must n't be careless .
that 's something we ca n't afford . "
with several top-name stars missing , klinsmann is likely to use fringe members of his squad against the portuguese .
" it 's the kind of match where we can have a look at one or two players , but we wo n't overdo the rotation .
i want to maintain the flow , " he said .
squad players such as argentina forward jose ernesto sosa , brazilian defender breno , defender andreas ottl and reserve goalkeeper hans joerg butt look set to feature .
sporting also warmed up for tuesday 's clash with a comfortable win at the weekend .
they beat 12th-placed pacos ferreira 2-0 on saturday courtesy of goals from brazilian strikers liedson and derlei which keeps them in touch with the top of the portuguese league as they remain four points off leaders porto . nda / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .
we were n't cold-blooded enough .
the players fought and gave everything but you simply have to take your chances . "
high-flyers now languishing in seventh bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's christoph dabrowski -lrb- l -rrb- puts his team ahead against leverkusen the draw follows two league defeats for leverkusen and leaves them seventh , nine points behind leaders hertha berlin and five adrift of fifth-placed sv hamburg in the nearest uefa cup qualifying place .
bochum are 14th , two points off the relegation zone and a point ahead of arminia bielefeld who played out a goalless draw with visiting eintracht frankfurt .
on saturday , hertha moved to 46 points , four points clear at the top of four teams with a 3-1 win at energie cottbus .
hoffenheim , who drew 0-0 with werder bremen , and bayern munich , who thrashed hanover 5-1 , are joint second , with wolfsburg fourth and hamburg fifth .
wolfsburg claimed a fifth successive league win by defeating karlsruhe 1-0 while hamburg slumped to a 4-1 defeat at struggling borussia moenchengladbach .
bayern goal-fest ideal tonic for the blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski was among the scorers in the 5-1 win bayern 's win was the ideal tonic after their german cup defeat last week and with a seemingly comfortable home leg to negotiate against sporting lisbon in the champions league on tuesday , munich 's season looks far from over .
however , munich coach juergen klinsmann insists his team 's last 16 clash with the portuguese is not a foregone conclusion despite the germans ' huge first-leg advantage .
italian world cup winner luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery both scored two goals in lisbon two weeks ago as bayern hammered their hosts 5-0 in the first leg .
both ribery , who is suffering with a shin complaint , and toni , struggling with an achilles problem , will be missing with injuries for the second leg at munich 's allianz arena .
klinsi cautious ahead of lisbon game and while lisbon face a virtually impossible task if they are to make the quarter-finals , klinsmann insists his side will not sit back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann warns his team not to relax against sporting " it looks a formality on paper , but it 's not .
we can take nothing for granted , " said the ex-germany boss .
" we need to take it seriously and must n't be careless .
that 's something we ca n't afford . "
with several top-name stars missing , klinsmann is likely to use fringe members of his squad against the portuguese .
" it 's the kind of match where we can have a look at one or two players , but we wo n't overdo the rotation .
i want to maintain the flow , " he said .
squad players such as argentina forward jose ernesto sosa , brazilian defender breno , defender andreas ottl and reserve goalkeeper hans joerg butt look set to feature .
sporting also warmed up for tuesday 's clash with a comfortable win at the weekend .
they beat 12th-placed pacos ferreira 2-0 on saturday courtesy of goals from brazilian strikers liedson and derlei which keeps them in touch with the top of the portuguese league as they remain four points off leaders porto . nda / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .

seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.03.2009 merkel under pressure as conservatives lose popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worsening economy has made merkel 's job tougher in an election year faced with sliding opinion poll ratings , members of germany 's conservative christian democratic union have urged their leader , chancellor angela merkel , to show stronger leadership six months ahead of a general election . a string of opinion polls released last week showed germany 's conservative bloc , made up of merkel 's christian democratic union or cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , losing popular support .
the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .

meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .

meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .

the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "

seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .
" if he makes a confession , if he spares his victims from having to appear here in public , he will get a corresponding reduction ... in his sentence , " anton winkler said . nda / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.03.2009 merkel under pressure as conservatives lose popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worsening economy has made merkel 's job tougher in an election year faced with sliding opinion poll ratings , members of germany 's conservative christian democratic union have urged their leader , chancellor angela merkel , to show stronger leadership six months ahead of a general election . a string of opinion polls released last week showed germany 's conservative bloc , made up of merkel 's christian democratic union or cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , losing popular support .
the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.03.2009 leverkusen scrape draw ; bayern buoyant ahead of lisbon clash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previously high-flying leverkusen have crashed to earth of late faltering bayer leverkusen failed to beat 10-man bochum drawing 1-1 in the bundesliga sunday .
meanwhile , bayern 's return to form this weekend boosts them ahead of their next champions league game against sporting lisbon . patrick helmes scored from the penalty spot in the 66th minute to rescue a point after christoph dabrowski had headed bochum in front at leverkusen 's temporary home in dusseldorf .
bochum 's mergim mavraj handled a cross from michal kadlec to give away the penalty , earning his second yellow card after being booked 10 minutes earlier for a foul on stefan kiessling .
leverkusen coach bruno labbadia began with the team which defeated bayern munich 4-2 in the quarter-finals of the german cup last wednesday .
but lowly bochum - without an away win this season - had looked comfortable until the penalty after taking the lead when dabrowski headed in a christian fuchs free-kick in the 32nd minute .
kiessling and lukas sinkiewicz missed first-half chances for leverkusen and brazilian defender henrique twice went close to a second for the home side when he headed just wide from a corner and had two close-range efforts saved by keeper daniel marcio fernandes .
" we did n't do enough in the first half but we had our chances in the second half .
it was a point but it feels like a defeat , " sinkiewicz said .
" we had three clear goal chances in the first half and then found ourselves chasing the game after going behind , " leverkusen sports director rudi voeller said . " we had some big chances and you just have to take them to force a win .
we were n't cold-blooded enough .
the players fought and gave everything but you simply have to take your chances . "
high-flyers now languishing in seventh bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's christoph dabrowski -lrb- l -rrb- puts his team ahead against leverkusen the draw follows two league defeats for leverkusen and leaves them seventh , nine points behind leaders hertha berlin and five adrift of fifth-placed sv hamburg in the nearest uefa cup qualifying place .
bochum are 14th , two points off the relegation zone and a point ahead of arminia bielefeld who played out a goalless draw with visiting eintracht frankfurt .
on saturday , hertha moved to 46 points , four points clear at the top of four teams with a 3-1 win at energie cottbus .
hoffenheim , who drew 0-0 with werder bremen , and bayern munich , who thrashed hanover 5-1 , are joint second , with wolfsburg fourth and hamburg fifth .
wolfsburg claimed a fifth successive league win by defeating karlsruhe 1-0 while hamburg slumped to a 4-1 defeat at struggling borussia moenchengladbach .
bayern goal-fest ideal tonic for the blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski was among the scorers in the 5-1 win bayern 's win was the ideal tonic after their german cup defeat last week and with a seemingly comfortable home leg to negotiate against sporting lisbon in the champions league on tuesday , munich 's season looks far from over .
however , munich coach juergen klinsmann insists his team 's last 16 clash with the portuguese is not a foregone conclusion despite the germans ' huge first-leg advantage .
italian world cup winner luca toni and french midfielder franck ribery both scored two goals in lisbon two weeks ago as bayern hammered their hosts 5-0 in the first leg .
both ribery , who is suffering with a shin complaint , and toni , struggling with an achilles problem , will be missing with injuries for the second leg at munich 's allianz arena .
klinsi cautious ahead of lisbon game and while lisbon face a virtually impossible task if they are to make the quarter-finals , klinsmann insists his side will not sit back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann warns his team not to relax against sporting " it looks a formality on paper , but it 's not .
we can take nothing for granted , " said the ex-germany boss .
" we need to take it seriously and must n't be careless .
that 's something we ca n't afford . "
with several top-name stars missing , klinsmann is likely to use fringe members of his squad against the portuguese .
" it 's the kind of match where we can have a look at one or two players , but we wo n't overdo the rotation .
i want to maintain the flow , " he said .
squad players such as argentina forward jose ernesto sosa , brazilian defender breno , defender andreas ottl and reserve goalkeeper hans joerg butt look set to feature .
sporting also warmed up for tuesday 's clash with a comfortable win at the weekend .
they beat 12th-placed pacos ferreira 2-0 on saturday courtesy of goals from brazilian strikers liedson and derlei which keeps them in touch with the top of the portuguese league as they remain four points off leaders porto . nda / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .

later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .

but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .
" if he makes a confession , if he spares his victims from having to appear here in public , he will get a corresponding reduction ... in his sentence , " anton winkler said . nda / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .

the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 09.03.2009 germany : eliminating europe 's tax havens a priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe and the us want banking transparency germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the debate which is raging around banking secrecy in europe .
it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.03.2009 merkel under pressure as conservatives lose popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worsening economy has made merkel 's job tougher in an election year faced with sliding opinion poll ratings , members of germany 's conservative christian democratic union have urged their leader , chancellor angela merkel , to show stronger leadership six months ahead of a general election . a string of opinion polls released last week showed germany 's conservative bloc , made up of merkel 's christian democratic union or cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , losing popular support .
the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .
" if he makes a confession , if he spares his victims from having to appear here in public , he will get a corresponding reduction ... in his sentence , " anton winkler said . nda / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .

the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 09.03.2009 germany : eliminating europe 's tax havens a priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe and the us want banking transparency germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the debate which is raging around banking secrecy in europe .
it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities . "
calmy-rey warned : " difficulties at ubs could weaken the international finance system . " df / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .

" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 09.03.2009 germany : eliminating europe 's tax havens a priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe and the us want banking transparency germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the debate which is raging around banking secrecy in europe .
it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities . "
calmy-rey warned : " difficulties at ubs could weaken the international finance system . " df / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.03.2009 merkel under pressure as conservatives lose popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worsening economy has made merkel 's job tougher in an election year faced with sliding opinion poll ratings , members of germany 's conservative christian democratic union have urged their leader , chancellor angela merkel , to show stronger leadership six months ahead of a general election . a string of opinion polls released last week showed germany 's conservative bloc , made up of merkel 's christian democratic union or cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , losing popular support .
the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities .

calmy-rey warned : " difficulties at ubs could weaken the international finance system . " df / sp / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long list of charges covering four different women were " in essence " accurate , 44-year-old helg sgarbi 's lawyer told the court in the german city of munich .
this meant the four women would not have to testify against him in court .
sgarbi , a swiss national , was accused of cheating klatten , 46 , out of seven million euros -lrb- $ 8.8 million -rrb- and trying to blackmail her for 49 million euros , saying he had video footage of their steamy hotel encounters .
three other women had allegedly fallen prey to him and voluntarily parted with millions of dollars .
" i would like to give the following statement , " sgarbi told the court , " i regret the events deeply and apologize here in this trial and in all publicity to the aggrieved women . "
klatten is the daughter of the late herbert quandt , the german industrialist who saved bmw from collapse in 1957 and built the bavarian carmaker into a world auto power .
the case was filed after she went to the police and exposed sgarbi .
klatten told tale of intricate con bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial in munich has seized media attention according to prosecutors , sgarbi first met klatten , who reputedly has a personal fortune running to several billion euros , at an exclusive austrian health resort in july 2007 .
the publicity-shy , married mother of three spurned sgarbi 's advances but began an affair when the smooth-talking sgarbi turned up unexpectedly in the south of france where she was on holiday the following month .
later in august 2007 they met in a holiday inn hotel in munich - where klatten believed she would not run the risk of bumping into any acquaintances - for an " intimate " encounter that sgarbi secretly filmed , according to the charges .
in september they met at the same hotel and this time sgarbi allegedly said that he needed 10 million euros because he had injured a little girl in a car crash in florida - asking klatten to lend him a cool seven million euros .
klatten swallowed his story , handing over the sum in the underground garage of the holiday inn in a cardboard box containing 14 plastic folders each with a thousand 500-euro banknotes .
sgarbi then told klatten to leave her husband and put into a trust fund 290 million euros to fund their new life together .
klatten balked , and ended the relationship .
blackmail causes nasty turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sgarbi wanted an initial 49 million euros to keep quiet sgarbi then turned nasty , according to prosecutors , threatening to send compromising video footage of the two together to the press and to her husband , among others .
this time he allegedly demanded 49 million euros , which he subsequently reduced to 14 million euros , and set a deadline of january 15 last year .
but she had long since informed the police , and sgarbi was arrested .
klatten is reputedly germany 's richest woman , with a large stake in bmw as well as a chemicals firm .
sgarbi , who has been in custody since his arrest in vomp , austria last year , faces four counts of serious fraud and two charges of attempted blackmail .
media claim sgarbi was a serial seducer who approached his wealthy victims at luxury hotels and duped them into thinking he loved them .
he persuaded them to give him millions of euros by inventing stories about needing money to pay compensation for a child he injured in a car accident .
con artist facing prison but hoping for leniency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law comes down hard on fraud and blackmail german law punishes serious fraud with up to 10 years in prison and blackmail with up to 15 years .
before monday 's hearing began , a spokesman for the munich prosecutor 's office told news channel ntv that sgarbi faced a prison sentence of several years but that he could expect some leniency if he were to plead guilty .

the conservative parties lost ground to their " grand coalition " partner at the national level , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , as the economic downturn takes its toll .
a forsa opinion poll saw the cdu / csu dropping to 33 percent . another for the ard television channel showed it slipped two points to 32 percent .
the polls showed the social democrats lagging behind the cdu / csu at between 24-27 percent , but the gap is closing .
for the first time , the ard poll showed merkel trailing foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd candidate for chancellor .
the cdu / csu hopes to win enough votes in the sept .
27 elections to ditch the spd and form a new coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - up one point at 17 percent .
but that outcome now looks less certain .
with national elections due in autumn , the cdu / csu-social democrat ruling alliance has been hamstrung by what voters perceive as a lack of political will to push through major policy changes .
this has prompted calls from some leading members of the cdu for the party to stop seeking to accommodate the spd and to sharpen its conservative profile .
" it has to be made clear the chapter of the grand coalition has drawn to a close and a new one is opening in which the cdu has to state clearly what it stands for , " said guenter oettinger , premier of the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg .
merkel needs to pay more attention to the interests of cdu 's business sector and conservative wing , oettinger said .
he warned that " no one will take her seriously as a chancellor of compromise . "
a distinct profile needed wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said the party needed to re-position itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier ' spd and merkel 's cdu are in a marriage of convenience " we should never allow ourselves to be viewed as a variant of the spd , " he told a cologne newspaper .
" we have to be a clear , political alternative . "
merkel 's fortunes and those of her party have waned since the recession took hold in germany at the end of 2008 , and she has been accused of indecision for her slow response to dealing with the crisis .
beware of your friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bavarian sister party csu is turning up the heat merkel 's position has been further undermined by the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , whose chairman horst seehofer has adopted a combative style since assuming the party leadership in october last year .
seehofer this week supported spd moves for higher curbs on executive pay . he also called for changes to parts of the recent health reform program , one of the key reforms of the coalition .
peter struck , the spd 's parliamentary leader accused the csu of being " a factor of instability " in the ruling coalition and said " its lack of trust " was making it difficult for merkel to assert herself .
business troubles merkel recently came under fire from conservatives within her own party - as well as business groups - for agreeing to legislation that could result in the nationalization of troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many conservatives are opposed to bailing out carmaker opel dieter hundt , president of the german employer 's federation , voiced " outrage " at the move .
" there is no need to do this even as a last resort ... any type of nationalisation or expropriation is out of place and a burden on germany 's position as an investment location , " hundt said .
" such a serious breaking of this taboo must be avoided . "
the chancellor faces another test as struggling carmaker opel appeals to the government for 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state aid to help it remain afloat .
" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " merkel said .
but deputy economics minister dagmar woehrl , a member of the csu , said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " the government would plough huge sums of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers . tt / sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's time for switzerland , austria and luxembourg to offer more transparency , he said . germany has been leading international efforts to put pressure on tax havens and bank secrecy nations .
steinbrueck said he 's surprised , but pleased , with the discussions that have sprung up over the issue .
" i 'm delighted to see how much momentum this debate has got going " in recent months , he told journalists on monday , march 9 , as he arrived for a meeting with his euro zone counterparts in brussels .
" these tax havens are also places where unregulated financial market deals are made .
who would have thought a year and a half ago that there would be so much momentum going now " for a clampdown , he said .
high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland cooperates with tax fraud investigations , but will not lift veil on secrecy laws the topic of banking secrecy is on the agenda at an upcoming group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- meeting of leading economic powers , which will be held in london in early april .
the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is preparing a blacklist of tax havens ahead of the g20 meeting .
luxembourg 's treasury and budget minister luc frieden denied that the three countries are tax havens at a meeting of finance ministers in his country on sunday , march 9 .
client confidentiality and protecting account information is " neither the cause of nor the solution for the international financial crisis , " he said .
deny being " tax havens " the g20 finance ministers meeting will be followed by an april summit of the heads of state in london . none of the three countries are members of the g20 , but frieden and his counterparts - switzerland 's hans-rudolf merz and josef proell , who is also austria 's vice-chancellor - called on european union members among the group to include them in the deliberations .
" one can not take such far-reaching decisions over the heads of the affected countries , " said proell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tax haven " countries ask to be included in g-20 finance summit under current laws , eu countries are required to share client data about savings accounts held by their citizens with other member states .
however austria , luxembourg and belgium are exempt from the rule and instead withhold taxes on interest income in accounts held by foreign nationals without revealing their identities to european fiscal authorities . since taxes are withheld , the three eu countries argue that their countries are not " tax havens . "
switzerland on the other hand is not a member state of the european union , but does provide foreign countries with judicial assistance in cases of tax and criminal fraud , said merz , who is both the swiss finance minister and president . swiss bank ubs under pressure from us and eu the alpine country has come under strong pressure from both major european countries and the united states to yield on its banking secrecy rules . last month swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 of its clients to the us treasury and paid off a $ 780 million -lrb- 618 million euros -rrb- fine to settle a case on abetting tax fraud .
in a separate lawsuit , the us government is forcing ubs 's hand in disclosing the identities of another 52,000 american clients who are under investigation for tax evasion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss bank ubs turned over data on some 300 us clients already last week , france and germany proposed that g20 members punish countries deemed to be " uncooperative " by breaking off bilateral fiscal conventions .
countries such as switzerland , austria and luxembourg have shown an increased willingness to cooperate with the us and the eu in combating tax fraud , but insist they will not cave in to pressure to otherwise disclose confidential client information . " we are ready to have a dialogue to find joint ways of stepping up the fight against tax fraud , " said luxembourg 's frieden .
czech minister defends switzerland at the sunday ministers meeting , the czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg defended switzerland against eu threats to clamp down on its banking practices , saying that a nation 's sovereignty is " worth more " than lost taxes .
" certainly tax coffers here and there miss out on a couple of million euros ...
the independence of a country and the traditions of an independent , neutral switzerland is however worth more than that , " said schwarzenberg , whose country hold the current six-month eu presidency .
" why must one spoil that at all cost ? " he added in an interview with the switzerland 's nzz am sonntag .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told the sunday newspaper that the united states " did not keep to playing rules " by seeking disclosure of those names .
us " fishing expedition " for alleged tax evaders " the us has now started a fishing expedition by demanding the 52,000 client data .
that goes against constitutional principles .
i have reflected this to my american colleague ...
we view this as an attack on switzerland , " she said .
in a separate meeting of foreign ministers on friday in which she met with her us counterpart hillary clinton , swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey said at a press conference , " it is very hard for switzerland to accept such pressure on ubs , " which is " an indirect pressure on the swiss authorities .

researchers say their device , which oxygenates blood outside the body before it goes through the lungs , could be an alternative to transplants .
the swansea university scientists say it could take many years before the device , the size of a spectacles case , is available .
lung patients , who have seen how it would work , have welcomed the research .
according to the british lung foundation , there are more than 40 conditions which affect the lungs and airways and impact on a person 's ability to breathe .
they include lung cancer , tuberculosis , asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -lrb- copd -rrb- , cystic fibrosis , sleep apnoea , avian flu , bronchiolitis and many others .
its research suggests that one person in every seven in the uk is affected by lung disease - this equates to approximately 8m people .
as of 6 march 2009 , 217 people were on the waiting list for a lung transplant according to figures by nhs blood and transplant .
now scientists in swansea are developing a portable artificial lung which could transform the lives of patients .
researchers claim that in the long term the device could offer an alternative to lung transplants , giving hope to those who suffer from conditions such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis .
the device mimics the function of a lung - by getting oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the blood stream .
professor bill johns came up with the idea after his son died of cystic fibrosis .
" it is important that we make something that will help people , who instead of being confined to a wheelchair with an oxygen bottle , can actually walk around and do things for themselves , he said .
although the research has been welcomed by leading charities , caution has also been voiced over the length of time it will take before a portable lung will become available .
" we have to stress that this is several years away from being used , even in a trial stage , " said chris mulholland , head of the british lung foundation .
" while we welcome the advances , we have to be realistic and know that one in five people could do with that help now . "
patient elizabeth spence from swansea has been refused the double lung transplant she needs but remains hopeful that one day the new device could help her .
" my body will reject the lungs , so this possibly could be an answer - another way of getting new lungs without actually having the transplant , " she said .

fred was shot at the somme in world war i and it was feared that he might never play football again " mike inker , fan it is working with the club and is also planning to contact cardiff council , the welsh assembly government and companies which sponsor the bluebirds for support .
a location for the statue , estimated to cost about £ 65,000 at july 2008 prices , has still to be decided .
suggestions include a plot within the club 's new in cardiff , or a spot within the city centre or in the bay .
bluebirds fan mike inker , 32 , from llandaff north , cardiff started the keenor petition 15 months ago .
he said he felt it was a " crying shame that a local lad who lifted the fa cup for cardiff city , really has n't been recognised in his own city " .
he said it was particularly pleasing that some of keenor 's relatives have signed the petition .
" fred was shot at the somme in world war i and it was feared that he might never play football again , " mr inker added .
potential partners " yet fred went on to captain city not only in the 1927 final , but also the one two years earlier against sheffield united . "
he described the statue as a long-term project and said he would like to see fans given a vote on its location " at the appropriate time " .
" the intention is to meet potential partners and sponsors on an informal basis to gauge support for the programme and assess what assistance that can be provided .
" a formal plan will then need to be drawn up and a project manager engaged to drive the scheme forward , " mr inker added .
he said he believed bluebirds fans across south wales and further afield will support the statue campaign .

little more than a year ago an extraordinary journey was beamed live to television sets around the world .
the then south korean president , roh moo-hyun , was in a car heading towards one of the most potent symbols of cold war hostility , his country 's land border with north korea .
on reaching the military demarcation line , mr roh stepped out of the motorcade and walked across , a gesture of reconciliation that once would have seemed impossible . "
i 'm certain that the south korean government will not let the north koreans cross the sea-border ever again " yoon doo-ho father of dead south korean soldier back in the car , a couple of hours later , his convoy was sweeping through the streets of the northern capital , pyongyang , cheered on by thousands of pompom-waving citizens .
up ahead the north korean leader kim jong-il was waiting to greet him .
that summit meeting , only the second time in history that the leaders of north and south have met , now seems a very long time ago .
north korea 's latest assessment of south korea 's current president and his political allies is far from friendly .
" the group of traitors has already reduced all the agreements reached between the north and the south in the past to dead documents , " said a statement carried by the country 's official news agency .
relations have reached " the brink of war " it goes on to say , therefore the north no longer considers itself bound by such agreements .
frosty relations so what has gone wrong ?
south korea 's conservative president , lee myung-bak , took office last february insisting that there would be no further unconditional economic aid for the north .
troublesome sea border known as northern limit line position in yellow sea declared by un in 1953 not recognised by north deadly naval skirmishes along the line in 1999 and 2002 regularly breached by north 's fishermen he also said further co-operation would depend on pyongyang 's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons .
that policy has infuriated north korea , which believes that strategic issues should be kept separate from the fledgling business and tourism links that were being carefully developed across the heavily fortified border .
so step by step , it has been unravelling those ties .
all cross-border tourism projects have been halted and regular government-to-government contact has been suspended .
only the joint industrial zone near the north korean city of kaesong remains .
the factories there have been built using south korean investment and are staffed with north korean labour .
the zone earns the north millions of dollars in badly needed foreign currency , but although reluctant to bite off the hand that feeds it , the chill in relations is still in evidence .
tighter border restrictions now mean that far fewer south korean managers are allowed to travel to kaesong , and the freight train link with the south has been cut .
' puppet war hawks ' north korea has been turning up the diplomatic heat .
a senior army official recently made an unusual appearance on state tv , threatening to wipe out what he called " the puppet war hawks in the south " .
there is growing concern that such words may eventually be accompanied by the possibility of violent action , perhaps a repeat of the small-scale military skirmishes that have taken place as recently as 2002 .
the north korean claim that it is no longer bound by previous agreements includes specific mention of those relating to its sea border with the south , a long-disputed boundary off the west coast .
lt cmdr yoon young-ha was one of six south korean sailors who died in the most recent gun battle with the north korean navy .
his father , 67-year-old yoon doo-ho , is concerned about the possibility of a repeat of such clashes .
" already too many people have died , " he said .
" i 'm certain that the south korean government will not let the north koreans cross the sea-border ever again .
" if it does happen i hope our navy will smash them to pieces . "
but blistering rhetorical outbursts are something of a north korean trademark .
many analysts believe that it uses them for diplomatic effect , when the need arises , to ratchet up political tension and give itself a stronger hand in international negotiations .
it may be no coincidence that the recent rise in hostility coincides with the arrival of a new administration in washington .
the south korean government says it has detected no unusual military activity north of the border .
" we hope that instead of threats of this kind , north korea would come out to talk to us on matters of mutual concern and interest , " prime minister han seung-soo told reporters .
but for the moment a return to dialogue and the heady days of handshakes across the border looks unlikely .
plenty of people , including the north of course , are ready to point the finger of blame at the south korean president .
but for some of his conservative supporters , there is a sense of vindication .
they have long argued that handshakes with north korea mean nothing , and the optimism that it would change its ways was always misplaced .

i 'm certain that the south korean government will not let the north koreans cross the sea-border ever again yoon doo-ho father of dead south korean soldier back in the car , a couple of hours later , his convoy was sweeping through the streets of the northern capital , pyongyang , cheered on by thousands of pompom-waving citizens .
up ahead the north korean leader kim jong-il was waiting to greet him .
that summit meeting , only the second time in history that the leaders of north and south have met , now seems a very long time ago .
north korea 's latest assessment of south korea 's current president and his political allies is far from friendly .
" the group of traitors has already reduced all the agreements reached between the north and the south in the past to dead documents , " said a statement carried by the country 's official news agency .
relations have reached " the brink of war " it goes on to say , therefore the north no longer considers itself bound by such agreements .
frosty relations so what has gone wrong ?
south korea 's conservative president , lee myung-bak , took office last february insisting that there would be no further unconditional economic aid for the north .
troublesome sea border known as northern limit line position in yellow sea declared by un in 1953 not recognised by north deadly naval skirmishes along the line in 1999 and 2002 regularly breached by north 's fishermen he also said further co-operation would depend on pyongyang 's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons .
that policy has infuriated north korea , which believes that strategic issues should be kept separate from the fledgling business and tourism links that were being carefully developed across the heavily fortified border .
so step by step , it has been unravelling those ties .
all cross-border tourism projects have been halted and regular government-to-government contact has been suspended .
only the joint industrial zone near the north korean city of kaesong remains .
the factories there have been built using south korean investment and are staffed with north korean labour .
the zone earns the north millions of dollars in badly needed foreign currency , but although reluctant to bite off the hand that feeds it , the chill in relations is still in evidence .
tighter border restrictions now mean that far fewer south korean managers are allowed to travel to kaesong , and the freight train link with the south has been cut .
' puppet war hawks ' north korea has been turning up the diplomatic heat .
a senior army official recently made an unusual appearance on state tv , threatening to wipe out what he called " the puppet war hawks in the south " .
there is growing concern that such words may eventually be accompanied by the possibility of violent action , perhaps a repeat of the small-scale military skirmishes that have taken place as recently as 2002 .
the north korean claim that it is no longer bound by previous agreements includes specific mention of those relating to its sea border with the south , a long-disputed boundary off the west coast .
lt cmdr yoon young-ha was one of six south korean sailors who died in the most recent gun battle with the north korean navy .
his father , 67-year-old yoon doo-ho , is concerned about the possibility of a repeat of such clashes .
" already too many people have died , " he said .
" i 'm certain that the south korean government will not let the north koreans cross the sea-border ever again .
" if it does happen i hope our navy will smash them to pieces . "
but blistering rhetorical outbursts are something of a north korean trademark .
many analysts believe that it uses them for diplomatic effect , when the need arises , to ratchet up political tension and give itself a stronger hand in international negotiations .
it may be no coincidence that the recent rise in hostility coincides with the arrival of a new administration in washington .
the south korean government says it has detected no unusual military activity north of the border .
" we hope that instead of threats of this kind , north korea would come out to talk to us on matters of mutual concern and interest , " prime minister han seung-soo told reporters .
but for the moment a return to dialogue and the heady days of handshakes across the border looks unlikely .
plenty of people , including the north of course , are ready to point the finger of blame at the south korean president .
but for some of his conservative supporters , there is a sense of vindication .
they have long argued that handshakes with north korea mean nothing , and the optimism that it would change its ways was always misplaced .

it 's going to be a celebration after the ulster hall 's two-year closure and multi-million pound renovation , but also a gig with a twist .
these well-known names , and the best of emerging local talent , will perform one of their own songs as well as a cover version of a something they saw performed at the ulster hall .

the sudden collapse of the prices paid for roses in europe , due to diminishing demand and oversupply , has made their business uneconomic .
and they are being forced to sell their farm as they can no longer keep up their loan payments to barclays bank , which is demanding immediate repayment .
happy valentine 's day enviro-flor rose exporters 40m roses exported per year 7 hectares of greenhouses 189 workers employed total zambia rose exports : 4,200 tonnes worth $ 40m in 2008 total employment : 12,000 " it 's a sad day , " says angelique elsinga as she walks round her farm with its eight giant greenhouses - which produced 40 million roses for export last year .
" it 's cheaper for us to destroy the roses now than send them to europe . "
they are shutting off the irrigation pipes in seven of those greenhouses , growing only for the local market and switching some of their production to vegetables .
the demand for roses - and the price - normally peaks at christmas and valentine 's day .
but this year was very different .
" we had to shut down production during the two weeks before christmas , something we had never done before , " said watze elsinga .
" and just before valentine 's day , our suppliers told us not to send any more roses - their warehouses were full . "
" we have never seen such low prices . "
sudden collapse yet just six months before , their business had seemed secure when they signed a long-term supply deal with a leading dutch wholesaler , blooms .
but in october , the company suddenly told them it was terminating the contract because of falling demand .
it was the first sign of the sharp slowdown that has gathered pace ever since .
" we have been surprised that this crisis has happened so fast , " said mr elsinga .
" as growers , we can not control either the prices we are paid , the exchange rate , or many of our external costs , even though we have managed to keep our own costs under control . "
social gains crunch time for africa world leaders will meet next month in london to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
see our in-depth guide to the g20 summit .
only one african country will be represented at summit .
this week bbc world news and world service radio will be examining how africa is coping with the crisis , with our blog and reports from the continent africa faces chill winds for the elsingas , who came to zambia from the netherlands 14 years ago , the farm was a social enterprise as well as a business .
they have constructed housing for their workers , and built a community centre and a school for 600 children on the premises .
and they have provided year-round employment for nearly 200 workers .
now they will have to lay off all the workers at the rose farm , with only a few finding employment in the vegetable business which they hope to continue at another location .
difficult conditions according to luke mbewe , chief executive of the zambia export growers association -lrb- zega -rrb- , flower exporters in zambia face more difficult conditions than their rivals in other african countries such as kenya , tanzania , and uganda .
flower exporters are dependent on a secure supply chain , with the fresh flowers kept refrigerated and disease-free as they are moved quickly from the farm to markets in europe within 48 hours .
but in zambia , transport costs are higher , because of the higher cost of petrol and jet fuel that has to be imported into this land-locked country .
and the lack of a substantial scheduled air freight service has meant that they have had to charter flights to take their flowers to market .
they have also faced problems with electricity supply , with zambia 's government-owned electricity company zesco introducing rolling power cuts throughout the country over the past year .
the sharp drop in the value of the zambian currency has raised the cost of fertilisers , fuel and other farm inputs .
mr mbewe says he knows of a number of other farms that have gone out of production , and he now fears for the future of the industry .
economic hopes zambia remains one of the world 's poorest countries , with more than 60 % of the population living on less than $ 2 a day .
now its prospects for economic growth have been dented by the decline in the world price of copper , which makes up 90 % of the country 's exports and provides thousands of jobs .
zambia 's president , rupiah banda , says that the way for zambia to cope with the global recession is by diversification , moving away from dependence on copper .
but the problems of the flower industry show how difficult this could be .
to become competitive , zambia 's flower growers will need more , not less aid to improve infrastructure - either from the government or outside sources .
but it is still unclear whether any global measures to cope with the downturn , to be discussed at the g20 summit of world leaders in london in april , will reach the flower growers of zambia in time .

but now the speed of the global downturn is forcing them to give up the business , threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of workers and their dependents .
the sudden collapse of the prices paid for roses in europe , due to diminishing demand and oversupply , has made their business uneconomic .
and they are being forced to sell their farm as they can no longer keep up their loan payments to barclays bank , which is demanding immediate repayment .
happy valentine 's day enviro-flor rose exporters 40m roses exported per year 7 hectares of greenhouses 189 workers employed total zambia rose exports : 4,200 tonnes worth $ 40m in 2008 total employment : 12,000 " it 's a sad day , " says angelique elsinga as she walks round her farm with its eight giant greenhouses - which produced 40 million roses for export last year .
" it 's cheaper for us to destroy the roses now than send them to europe . "
they are shutting off the irrigation pipes in seven of those greenhouses , growing only for the local market and switching some of their production to vegetables .
the demand for roses - and the price - normally peaks at christmas and valentine 's day .
but this year was very different .
" we had to shut down production during the two weeks before christmas , something we had never done before , " said watze elsinga .
" and just before valentine 's day , our suppliers told us not to send any more roses - their warehouses were full . "
" we have never seen such low prices . "
sudden collapse abandoned greenhouses mark the collapse of the flower export market yet just six months before , their business had seemed secure when they signed a long-term supply deal with a leading dutch wholesaler , blooms .
but in october , the company suddenly told them it was terminating the contract because of falling demand .
it was the first sign of the sharp slowdown that has gathered pace ever since .
" we have been surprised that this crisis has happened so fast , " said mr elsinga .
" as growers , we can not control either the prices we are paid , the exchange rate , or many of our external costs , even though we have managed to keep our own costs under control . "
social gains crunch time for africa world leaders will meet next month in london to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
see our in-depth guide to the g20 summit .
only one african country will be represented at summit .
this week bbc world news and world service radio will be examining how africa is coping with the crisis , with our blog and reports from the continent africa faces chill winds for the elsingas , who came to zambia from the netherlands 14 years ago , the farm was a social enterprise as well as a business .
they have constructed housing for their workers , and built a community centre and a school for 600 children on the premises .
and they have provided year-round employment for nearly 200 workers .
now they will have to lay off all the workers at the rose farm , with only a few finding employment in the vegetable business which they hope to continue at another location .
difficult conditions according to luke mbewe , chief executive of the zambia export growers association -lrb- zega -rrb- , flower exporters in zambia face more difficult conditions than their rivals in other african countries such as kenya , tanzania , and uganda .
flower exporters are dependent on a secure supply chain , with the fresh flowers kept refrigerated and disease-free as they are moved quickly from the farm to markets in europe within 48 hours .
but in zambia , transport costs are higher , because of the higher cost of petrol and jet fuel that has to be imported into this land-locked country .
and the lack of a substantial scheduled air freight service has meant that they have had to charter flights to take their flowers to market .
they have also faced problems with electricity supply , with zambia 's government-owned electricity company zesco introducing rolling power cuts throughout the country over the past year .
the sharp drop in the value of the zambian currency has raised the cost of fertilisers , fuel and other farm inputs .
mr mbewe says he knows of a number of other farms that have gone out of production , and he now fears for the future of the industry .
economic hopes president rupiah banda wants to encourage economic diversification zambia remains one of the world 's poorest countries , with more than 60 % of the population living on less than $ 2 a day .
now its prospects for economic growth have been dented by the decline in the world price of copper , which makes up 90 % of the country 's exports and provides thousands of jobs .
zambia 's president , rupiah banda , says that the way for zambia to cope with the global recession is by diversification , moving away from dependence on copper .
but the problems of the flower industry show how difficult this could be .
to become competitive , zambia 's flower growers will need more , not less aid to improve infrastructure - either from the government or outside sources .
but it is still unclear whether any global measures to cope with the downturn , to be discussed at the g20 summit of world leaders in london in april , will reach the flower growers of zambia in time .

gender discrimination remains widespread in europe .
here european commission vice-president margot wallstrom explains why she is campaigning to get more women into senior eu positions .
this is part of a viewpoint series ahead of the june european elections .
i am lucky to come from a country - sweden - where gender equality is practically taken for granted .
margot wallstrom says politics is still not an easy option for women i was first elected as an mp at the age of 24 and held ministerial positions in sweden before being nominated twice as a european commissioner .
it would be nice to think that this is the norm in all democracies , but unfortunately this is far from being the case .
in europe , for example , a fair representation of women in politics and business remains an unachieved dream .
i have been fortunate enough to have had a seat at tables where decisions are made , but in the governments of eu countries , only 24 % are women , and most of them are in charge of cultural or social issues .
not even one in four members of national parliaments are women .
' dysfunctional ' eu family when it comes to the top eu jobs the picture is even more bleak : out of 12 european parliament presidents , only two have been women , and there has never been a female president of the european commission .
when you look at the " family photos " from european summits you see a very strange , " dysfunctional " family .
most of the time they 're all men except for -lsb- german chancellor -rsb- angela merkel !
angela merkel is often the odd one out at summits i have also been fortunate to have had a husband who was willing and able to help out with the family .
i still have n't seen my kids as much as i would like though , and for many other women going into politics is not an option because of the long hours and the regular travelling .
in order to create a level playing field there must at least be decent childcare systems in place .
this is not the case in most countries .
-lrb- attitudes are also interesting - during the us election campaign some people questioned whether sarah palin could be the vice-president because she had five children .
would that ever be asked of a man ? -rrb-
female perspective let me be very clear : i am not arguing that women are better than men .
what i am arguing is that representative democracy which excludes 52 % of the population from the decision-making tables is not real democracy at all .
it is in the interest of society as a whole - women and men - that we be represented equally .
why ?
because women bring a different view of the world to the table - they have different experiences , they see things differently and they act differently .
at the speed at which the wage gap between men and women is closing , it will take another 70 years before equality is reached an example -lrb- to generalise -rrb- : to a man , the word " security " often means tank battalions and missile defence systems .
to a woman it can mean access to education and clean drinking water for children .
and is n't it perhaps telling in the current financial crisis that the -lrb- male -rrb- prime minister of iceland and the -lrb- male -rrb- ceos of that unfortunate country 's banks have been replaced recently by women ?
to quote the business editor of the observer , ruth sunderland : " women are the single biggest - and least acknowledged - force for economic growth on the planet .
this is not a claim made by rampant feminists , but by the economist , which suggests that over the past few decades women have contributed more to the expansion of the world economy than either new technology or the emerging markets of china and india .
but surprise , surprise : technology and emerging markets have gleaned acres of coverage in the business press ; the potential of women , seen as a ' soft ' issue , has not . "
gender discrimination of all kinds is banned in the eu treaties , which also include the principle of equal pay for equal work .
nonetheless , it might surprise you to know that women in europe today are still paid on average close to 16 % less than men for the same job .
at the speed at which the wage gap between men and women is closing , it will take another 70 years before equality is reached .
the commission has proposed legislation to reinforce the right to maternity leave and has recommended action to provide more and better childcare facilities .
we have also begun talks with employers and trade unions on parental leave .
to tackle the problem of violence , particularly against women and children , the eu finances the work of ngos and local authorities in protecting the victims of violence .
to encourage and help more women to set up businesses , the commission supports the eu network of female entrepreneurs .
with a solid implementation throughout the eu of our policies and recommendations , i believe europe can lead by example .
a more concrete opportunity for change will present itself soon , when european parliament elections take place at the beginning of june .
i and hundreds of other european politicians , male and female , have been supporting a campaign run by the european women 's lobby which aims to persuade : the european council to appoint women to top eu jobs ; political parties to include equal numbers of women and men in their electoral lists ; and women and men to get out on polling day and use their vote .

gender discrimination remains widespread in europe .
here european commission vice-president margot wallstrom explains why she is campaigning to get more women into senior eu positions .
this is part of a viewpoint series ahead of the june european elections .
i am lucky to come from a country - sweden - where gender equality is practically taken for granted .
margot wallstrom says politics is still not an easy option for women i was first elected as an mp at the age of 24 and held ministerial positions in sweden before being nominated twice as a european commissioner .
it would be nice to think that this is the norm in all democracies , but unfortunately this is far from being the case .
in europe , for example , a fair representation of women in politics and business remains an unachieved dream .
i have been fortunate enough to have had a seat at tables where decisions are made , but in the governments of eu countries , only 24 % are women , and most of them are in charge of cultural or social issues .
not even one in four members of national parliaments are women .
' dysfunctional ' eu family when it comes to the top eu jobs the picture is even more bleak : out of 12 european parliament presidents , only two have been women , and there has never been a female president of the european commission .
when you look at the " family photos " from european summits you see a very strange , " dysfunctional " family .
most of the time they 're all men except for -lsb- german chancellor -rsb- angela merkel !
angela merkel is often the odd one out at summits i have also been fortunate to have had a husband who was willing and able to help out with the family .
i still have n't seen my kids as much as i would like though , and for many other women going into politics is not an option because of the long hours and the regular travelling .
in order to create a level playing field there must at least be decent childcare systems in place .
this is not the case in most countries .
-lrb- attitudes are also interesting - during the us election campaign some people questioned whether sarah palin could be the vice-president because she had five children .
would that ever be asked of a man ? -rrb-
female perspective let me be very clear : i am not arguing that women are better than men .
what i am arguing is that representative democracy which excludes 52 % of the population from the decision-making tables is not real democracy at all .
it is in the interest of society as a whole - women and men - that we be represented equally .
why ?
because women bring a different view of the world to the table - they have different experiences , they see things differently and they act differently .
at the speed at which the wage gap between men and women is closing , it will take another 70 years before equality is reached an example -lrb- to generalise -rrb- : to a man , the word " security " often means tank battalions and missile defence systems .
to a woman it can mean access to education and clean drinking water for children .
and is n't it perhaps telling in the current financial crisis that the -lrb- male -rrb- prime minister of iceland and the -lrb- male -rrb- ceos of that unfortunate country 's banks have been replaced recently by women ?
to quote the business editor of the observer , ruth sunderland : " women are the single biggest - and least acknowledged - force for economic growth on the planet .
this is not a claim made by rampant feminists , but by the economist , which suggests that over the past few decades women have contributed more to the expansion of the world economy than either new technology or the emerging markets of china and india .
but surprise , surprise : technology and emerging markets have gleaned acres of coverage in the business press ; the potential of women , seen as a ' soft ' issue , has not . "
gender discrimination of all kinds is banned in the eu treaties , which also include the principle of equal pay for equal work .
nonetheless , it might surprise you to know that women in europe today are still paid on average close to 16 % less than men for the same job .
at the speed at which the wage gap between men and women is closing , it will take another 70 years before equality is reached .
the commission has proposed legislation to reinforce the right to maternity leave and has recommended action to provide more and better childcare facilities .
we have also begun talks with employers and trade unions on parental leave .
to tackle the problem of violence , particularly against women and children , the eu finances the work of ngos and local authorities in protecting the victims of violence .
to encourage and help more women to set up businesses , the commission supports the eu network of female entrepreneurs .
with a solid implementation throughout the eu of our policies and recommendations , i believe europe can lead by example .
a more concrete opportunity for change will present itself soon , when european parliament elections take place at the beginning of june .
i and hundreds of other european politicians , male and female , have been supporting a campaign run by the european women 's lobby which aims to persuade : the european council to appoint women to top eu jobs ; political parties to include equal numbers of women and men in their electoral lists ; and women and men to get out on polling day and use their vote .

the yougov study for the women 's charity ywca asked 2,015 adults their views on girls drinking .
the welsh assembly government said it already offered alcohol education programmes in 98 % of primary and secondary schools in wales .
sarah payne , chief executive of ywca , said the public increasingly recognised that " it is education and support that is needed , not criminalisation " .
" although many people drink because they enjoy it , we believe that the one of the issues around binge drinking , by young women especially , is linked to them having low self esteem , low self-confidence and nothing to do . "
the charity called for local authorities to provide more constructive activities for young women .
it said education should warn of the dangers of binge-drinking - defined in the survey as drinking double the recommended amount of alcohol in a single day . "
the young drinking culture here ... raises the potential for increased violent incidents and accidents " catriona williams , children in wales the survey found 56 % of people in wales said their parents had taught them how to drink safely , with only 13 % learning at school .
ms payne said : " we must not assume that all young people have safe and supportive homes to go to .
for those who do not , and unfortunately there are quite a few , parental education on alcohol will be limited .
" hanging out and getting drunk may even be preferable or even safer to going home , " she said .
a study by the world health organisation in 2008 found more children in wales had been drunk at least twice before their 13th birthday than anywhere else in europe or north america .
the survey of 250,000 young people in 40 countries put wales behind both scotland and england .
catriona williams , the chief executive of the charity children in wales said the trend towards excessive underage drinking had escalated in recent years .
" the young drinking culture here is also very different to that in other parts of europe and raises the potential for increased violent incidents and accidents .
" we also know that young people themselves worry about their younger siblings getting involved at younger and younger ages . "
" the drinking culture amongst girls is also a particularly worrying trend with the potential for casual unprotected sex or unintended pregnancies and wales has amongst the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in europe , " she said .
she said the charity believed there should be much stronger enforcement of laws against people selling alcohol to under-age drinkers .
education programmes a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said it was very concerned by the harmful use of alcohol , especially by young people .
" our strategy ' working together to reduce harm ' sets out how the welsh assembly government and partner organisations will work to reduce the damage caused to individuals , their families and society from substance misuse , " said the spokesperson .
" we believe that education about the use of alcohol for people of all ages , but in particular young people , is a key factor in tackling misuse .
" we already offer alcohol education programmes in 98 % of primary and secondary schools in wales . "
they also said the assembly government was also pressing for stricter rules on the promotion of alcohol , an increase in taxation , minimum pricing and a reduction in the drink-drive limit .

in wales , 74 % of those surveyed thought young people drank because their friends did and because it was normal .
the yougov study for the women 's charity ywca asked 2,015 adults their views on girls drinking .
the welsh assembly government said it already offered alcohol education programmes in 98 % of primary and secondary schools in wales .
sarah payne , chief executive of ywca , said the public increasingly recognised that " it is education and support that is needed , not criminalisation " .
" although many people drink because they enjoy it , we believe that the one of the issues around binge drinking , by young women especially , is linked to them having low self esteem , low self-confidence and nothing to do . "
the charity called for local authorities to provide more constructive activities for young women .
it said education should warn of the dangers of binge-drinking - defined in the survey as drinking double the recommended amount of alcohol in a single day .
the young drinking culture here ... raises the potential for increased violent incidents and accidents catriona williams , children in wales the survey found 56 % of people in wales said their parents had taught them how to drink safely , with only 13 % learning at school .
ms payne said : " we must not assume that all young people have safe and supportive homes to go to .
for those who do not , and unfortunately there are quite a few , parental education on alcohol will be limited .
" hanging out and getting drunk may even be preferable or even safer to going home , " she said .
a study by the world health organisation in 2008 found more children in wales had been drunk at least twice before their 13th birthday than anywhere else in europe or north america .
the survey of 250,000 young people in 40 countries put wales behind both scotland and england .
catriona williams , the chief executive of the charity children in wales said the trend towards excessive underage drinking had escalated in recent years .
" the young drinking culture here is also very different to that in other parts of europe and raises the potential for increased violent incidents and accidents .
" we also know that young people themselves worry about their younger siblings getting involved at younger and younger ages . "
" the drinking culture amongst girls is also a particularly worrying trend with the potential for casual unprotected sex or unintended pregnancies and wales has amongst the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in europe , " she said .
she said the charity believed there should be much stronger enforcement of laws against people selling alcohol to under-age drinkers .
education programmes a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said it was very concerned by the harmful use of alcohol , especially by young people .
" our strategy ' working together to reduce harm ' sets out how the welsh assembly government and partner organisations will work to reduce the damage caused to individuals , their families and society from substance misuse , " said the spokesperson .
" we believe that education about the use of alcohol for people of all ages , but in particular young people , is a key factor in tackling misuse .
" we already offer alcohol education programmes in 98 % of primary and secondary schools in wales . "
they also said the assembly government was also pressing for stricter rules on the promotion of alcohol , an increase in taxation , minimum pricing and a reduction in the drink-drive limit .

but there are early signs of the international economic winds doing damage to the continent .
many african countries have seen a real revival of economic growth in the last decade .
those gains could be in danger .
the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- is certainly worried , and along with president kikwete of tanzania , has convened a conference on the problem in dar-es-salaam , to run from tuesday to wednesday .
less than a year ago , the imf 's forecast for sub-saharan africa was economic growth of 6.7 % in 2009 .
its most recent projection is sharply lower , between 3 % and 3.5 % .
that translates into very weak growth in output per person , which is a rough measure of average living standards .
to get some perspective on how much difference this makes , suppose the population of the region continues to grow at 2.4 % , as it did in 2007 .
with economic growth of 3 % it would take 118 years to double output per person .
but at 6 % economic growth it would take 20 years .
at 9 % - the kind of performance china has achieved in recent years - it would take just 11 years .
oil price impact the good news for africa is that it has little direct exposure to the credit crisis .
african banks have not invested much , if at all , in the problem financial assets at the heart of the crisis .
it might also help that a large share of the region 's economy is agriculture for domestic markets , which is less exposed to the international storms .
but there are likely to be several indirect effects .
the global downturn has undermined demand for many industrial commodities , which are important exports for several african countries .
this includes oil in nigeria , angola and equatorial guinea , and copper in zambia .
prices of both have fallen sharply since last summer .
crude oil is down by about 70 % from its peak last july , and copper by about two-thirds .
these developments are , however , helpful for those countries that are importers of these commodities .
there are many anecdotal reports of other exports also being affected by weaker demand from the rich countries , including cut flowers and textiles .
vital funds remittances , money sent home by people working abroad , also look vulnerable .
crunch time for africa world leaders will meet next month in london to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
click here for our in-depth guide to the g20 summit .
only one african country will be represented at summit .
this week bbc world news and world service radio will be examining how africa is coping with the crisis , with reports from around the continent wilting flower exports hit zambia africa 's thriving private sector the money can be used to support family living standards , or to invest in small enterprises .
in 2007 , $ 19bn -lrb- £ 13bn -rrb- was sent home by africans , more than double the level just three years earlier .
but three-quarters of african remittances come from western europe or the us , which are already in recession .
further job losses are likely , and migrants are bound to be affected .
another possible casualty is foreign direct investment - when a foreign firm buys a large stake in a local one or sets up a new operation of its own .
that too has grown rapidly in the last few years in africa , much of it linked to the extraction of industrial commodities .
more than $ 30bn poured into african economies in 2007 , not very far short of what it got in aid - $ 39bn dollars in the same year .
the swings in commodity prices make investing in the business look less attractive , and foreign firms with declining profits and difficult credit markets will find it harder to fund new projects .
africa can not rely on being immune from global financial problems .
more aid ?
african banks are in reasonable shape now , but weaker economic growth could mean more firms getting into difficulty with loan repayments , which would in turn increase losses for banks .
there is also a possibility that foreign owned banks with problems at home might want to pull funds out of africa .
in several countries more than half of banking business is in the hands of such banks .
the slowdown is also likely to hit government tax revenues .
the imf says some countries can cope - they have used the good times to strengthen government finances .
but others will struggle , and will have to make spending cuts unless they get more aid .
aid is controversial .
some say it is often wasted .
but one of the big messages from the imf is for the rich countries - it 's time to step up , not cut back on aid .

the bbc 's nik wood talks to tanzanians about the global recession to get some perspective on how much difference this makes , suppose the population of the region continues to grow at 2.4 % , as it did in 2007 .
with economic growth of 3 % it would take 118 years to double output per person .
but at 6 % economic growth it would take 20 years .
at 9 % - the kind of performance china has achieved in recent years - it would take just 11 years .
oil price impact the good news for africa is that it has little direct exposure to the credit crisis .
african banks have not invested much , if at all , in the problem financial assets at the heart of the crisis .
the fall in the global price of copper has hit zambia it might also help that a large share of the region 's economy is agriculture for domestic markets , which is less exposed to the international storms .
but there are likely to be several indirect effects .
the global downturn has undermined demand for many industrial commodities , which are important exports for several african countries .
this includes oil in nigeria , angola and equatorial guinea , and copper in zambia .
prices of both have fallen sharply since last summer .
crude oil is down by about 70 % from its peak last july , and copper by about two-thirds .
these developments are , however , helpful for those countries that are importers of these commodities .
there are many anecdotal reports of other exports also being affected by weaker demand from the rich countries , including cut flowers and textiles .
vital funds remittances , money sent home by people working abroad , also look vulnerable .
crunch time for africa world leaders will meet next month in london to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
click here for our in-depth guide to the g20 summit .
only one african country will be represented at summit .
this week bbc world news and world service radio will be examining how africa is coping with the crisis , with reports from around the continent wilting flower exports hit zambia africa 's thriving private sector the money can be used to support family living standards , or to invest in small enterprises .
in 2007 , $ 19bn -lrb- £ 13bn -rrb- was sent home by africans , more than double the level just three years earlier .
but three-quarters of african remittances come from western europe or the us , which are already in recession .
further job losses are likely , and migrants are bound to be affected .
another possible casualty is foreign direct investment - when a foreign firm buys a large stake in a local one or sets up a new operation of its own .
that too has grown rapidly in the last few years in africa , much of it linked to the extraction of industrial commodities .
more than $ 30bn poured into african economies in 2007 , not very far short of what it got in aid - $ 39bn dollars in the same year .
the swings in commodity prices make investing in the business look less attractive , and foreign firms with declining profits and difficult credit markets will find it harder to fund new projects .
africa can not rely on being immune from global financial problems .
more aid ?
african banks are in reasonable shape now , but weaker economic growth could mean more firms getting into difficulty with loan repayments , which would in turn increase losses for banks .
african oil exports have been hit by the sharp fall in prices there is also a possibility that foreign owned banks with problems at home might want to pull funds out of africa .
in several countries more than half of banking business is in the hands of such banks .
the slowdown is also likely to hit government tax revenues .
the imf says some countries can cope - they have used the good times to strengthen government finances .
but others will struggle , and will have to make spending cuts unless they get more aid .
aid is controversial .
some say it is often wasted .
but one of the big messages from the imf is for the rich countries - it 's time to step up , not cut back on aid .
