but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the supervisory board of deutsche bank unanimously decided to request that dr. josef ackermann should extend his contract by three years , until the annual general meeting of 2013 , " germany 's biggest bank said in a statement .
ackermann , who in february announced he would step down as scheduled in 2010 , agreed to the surprise extension , which is to be formally ratified at a board meeting on july 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were angered by ackermann 's complacency during his 2004 corruption trial the swiss national is a controversial figure in germany .
as one of the highest-paid executives in the country , he famously came under fire after a photo was taken of him making a victory-sign with his fingers at a corruption trial in 2004 in which he was acquitted .
as the financial crisis started to hit global markets , critics accused the 61-year-old of being too proud and stubborn because in contrast to other banks the manager persistently rejected state aid , saying deutsche bank was strong enough to pull out of the crisis by itself .
and indeed , the extension of ackermann 's contract is backed by surprising first quarter profits , which the bank released on tuesday .
" dr. ackermann has given deutsche bank strong strategic positioning and steered the bank safely through the crisis , " clemens boersig , chairman of the supervisory board , said in a statement .
" our performance in the first quarter 2009 is impressive evidence of this , " he added .
the frankfurt-based bank said net profit for the january-march period came in at 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.56 billion dollars -rrb- .
revenue increased by 57 percent to 7.2 billion from 4.6 billion euros compared to the first quarter last year .
the upturn was mainly due to good business in the investment banking sector which had posted severe losses last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has rejected state aid to pull through the financial crisis in 2008 , deutsche bank suffered a record net loss of 3.9 billion euros -lrb- 5.3 billion dollars -rrb- , its first loss since the bank assumed its present form in 1956 .
but the bank has said it can overcome the global financial crisis without state aid . deutsche bank is the latest global bank to report solid first quarter results , along with bank of america , goldman sachs and credit suisse , giving a glimmer of hope that the financial crisis could slowly be getting over the worst . nk , rm , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the supervisory board of deutsche bank unanimously decided to request that dr. josef ackermann should extend his contract by three years , until the annual general meeting of 2013 , " germany 's biggest bank said in a statement .
ackermann , who in february announced he would step down as scheduled in 2010 , agreed to the surprise extension , which is to be formally ratified at a board meeting on july 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were angered by ackermann 's complacency during his 2004 corruption trial the swiss national is a controversial figure in germany .
as one of the highest-paid executives in the country , he famously came under fire after a photo was taken of him making a victory-sign with his fingers at a corruption trial in 2004 in which he was acquitted .
as the financial crisis started to hit global markets , critics accused the 61-year-old of being too proud and stubborn because in contrast to other banks the manager persistently rejected state aid , saying deutsche bank was strong enough to pull out of the crisis by itself .
and indeed , the extension of ackermann 's contract is backed by surprising first quarter profits , which the bank released on tuesday .
" dr. ackermann has given deutsche bank strong strategic positioning and steered the bank safely through the crisis , " clemens boersig , chairman of the supervisory board , said in a statement .
" our performance in the first quarter 2009 is impressive evidence of this , " he added .
the frankfurt-based bank said net profit for the january-march period came in at 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.56 billion dollars -rrb- .
revenue increased by 57 percent to 7.2 billion from 4.6 billion euros compared to the first quarter last year .
the upturn was mainly due to good business in the investment banking sector which had posted severe losses last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has rejected state aid to pull through the financial crisis in 2008 , deutsche bank suffered a record net loss of 3.9 billion euros -lrb- 5.3 billion dollars -rrb- , its first loss since the bank assumed its present form in 1956 .
but the bank has said it can overcome the global financial crisis without state aid . deutsche bank is the latest global bank to report solid first quarter results , along with bank of america , goldman sachs and credit suisse , giving a glimmer of hope that the financial crisis could slowly be getting over the worst . nk , rm , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .

president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .
they all were aged between 18 and 20 .
" we know that two of the auschwitz prisoners who signed the message survived the camp , but their later fate is not known , " mensfeld said .
" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .
perhaps the publicity surrounding this discovery will lead to more information . "
the note was found as workers were taking down a wall in the school 's basement .
the building had belonged to the camp during nazi occupation and had served as a warehouse for the camp 's guards .
nazi germany established auschwitz as part of the systematic genocide against european jews during world war ii .
it 's estimated that more than one million people – mostly european jews – died in the auschwitz-birkenau camp alone .
the victims also included soviet prisoners of war , romas and anti-nazi resistance fighter from across europe . ai , rm dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days .

" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .

" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .

fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .

angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .

instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .

amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .
every time they have stated that amflora is as safe as conventional potatoes and therefore we expect they will come to the same conclusion again , " said johansson . nk / sh , dpa , afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pontiff 's first stop was the village of onna where almost a sixth of the hamlet 's 300 residents were killed three weeks ago by the quake , which measured a magnitude of 6.3 on the richter scale .
" i encourage everyone , institutions and businesses , to see that this village and this region are reborn , " the pope said at a tent camp for homeless survivors outside onna .
he also said that he had made the trip to express his closeness to the people of the region in " the most direct way possible " .
pope benedict xvi later travelled to the abruzzo capital l 'aquila , 100 km north-east of rome , where he visited the ruins of the 13th century basilica of santa maria di collegmaggio , whose roof caved in during the april 6 earthquake , italy 's worst in a generation .
the head of the roman catholic church also visited a dormitory where eight students died in the disaster as well as a military academy where a mass funeral took place for 205 victims of the quake on april 10 , when pope benedict led good friday observances in rome and at the vatican .
the earthquake hit 26 towns and villages in the abruzzo region in the apennine mountains and drove around 50,000 from their homes and toppled or heavily damaged thousands of buildings across the region .
last week italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced that l 'aquila would in july host a g8 summit rather than the original choice of la maddalena , an island off sardinia . ml , rm , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .
they all were aged between 18 and 20 .
" we know that two of the auschwitz prisoners who signed the message survived the camp , but their later fate is not known , " mensfeld said .
" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .
perhaps the publicity surrounding this discovery will lead to more information . "
the note was found as workers were taking down a wall in the school 's basement .
the building had belonged to the camp during nazi occupation and had served as a warehouse for the camp 's guards .
nazi germany established auschwitz as part of the systematic genocide against european jews during world war ii .
it 's estimated that more than one million people – mostly european jews – died in the auschwitz-birkenau camp alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.04.2009 us change of rhetoric on climate welcomed at washington talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary clinton at the climate change conference in washington europeans hope that a change of tone on climate change by the us will break the deadlock over climate negotiations . the us has pledged to make up for lost time in the fight against climate change .
at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is one of the ideological leaders of the neo-nazi scene , " prosecutor stefan apostol said friday , alleging that honsik had also passed out his publications at schools .
both the prosecution and the defendant plan to appeal the verdict and sentence , austrian press agency apa reported .
the 67-year-old defendant said he rejected " the doctrine which demonizes national socialism , " but claimed he was not a national socialist himself .
honsik , who wrote the book “ acquittal for hitler ? ” in 1988 , defended himself by arguing that he did not deny the existence of all the gas chambers in nazi concentration camps .
after his lawyer herbert schaller pointed out that it was not honsik but " fine and righteous foreigners " who had first denied the existence of gas chambers , the prosecutor said he would consider whether also to indict schaller under austria 's law banning national socialist activities .
in 1992 , an austrian court had passed an 18-month prison term against honsik for denying the crimes committed by hitler 's regime .
before starting his sentence , honsik fled to spain , but he was eventually extradited in 2007 .
another prominent holocaust denier , the british writer david irving , received a sentence of two years in prison and one year of probation from austrian courts in 2006 . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.04.2009 heynckes charged with salvaging post-klinsmann bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes gave ribery and toni a good talking-to on tuesday at the age of 63 , and having coached nine other first-division clubs , bayern 's new coach jupp heynckes has lots of experience .
but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.04.2009 germany gives green light to genetically modified potato trials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf says its genetically modified potato amflora is safe germany 's agriculture minister has once more fanned the debate over genetically modified crops by approving test cultivation of a genetically modified potato . germany has given the green light for further test cultivation of amflora , a genetically-modified potato manufactured by chemicals giant basf .
the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .
every time they have stated that amflora is as safe as conventional potatoes and therefore we expect they will come to the same conclusion again , " said johansson . nk / sh , dpa , afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.04.2009 us change of rhetoric on climate welcomed at washington talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary clinton at the climate change conference in washington europeans hope that a change of tone on climate change by the us will break the deadlock over climate negotiations . the us has pledged to make up for lost time in the fight against climate change .
at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .

european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .
every time they have stated that amflora is as safe as conventional potatoes and therefore we expect they will come to the same conclusion again , " said johansson . nk / sh , dpa , afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .

" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the supervisory board of deutsche bank unanimously decided to request that dr. josef ackermann should extend his contract by three years , until the annual general meeting of 2013 , " germany 's biggest bank said in a statement .
ackermann , who in february announced he would step down as scheduled in 2010 , agreed to the surprise extension , which is to be formally ratified at a board meeting on july 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were angered by ackermann 's complacency during his 2004 corruption trial the swiss national is a controversial figure in germany .
as one of the highest-paid executives in the country , he famously came under fire after a photo was taken of him making a victory-sign with his fingers at a corruption trial in 2004 in which he was acquitted .
as the financial crisis started to hit global markets , critics accused the 61-year-old of being too proud and stubborn because in contrast to other banks the manager persistently rejected state aid , saying deutsche bank was strong enough to pull out of the crisis by itself .
and indeed , the extension of ackermann 's contract is backed by surprising first quarter profits , which the bank released on tuesday .
" dr. ackermann has given deutsche bank strong strategic positioning and steered the bank safely through the crisis , " clemens boersig , chairman of the supervisory board , said in a statement .
" our performance in the first quarter 2009 is impressive evidence of this , " he added .
the frankfurt-based bank said net profit for the january-march period came in at 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.56 billion dollars -rrb- .
revenue increased by 57 percent to 7.2 billion from 4.6 billion euros compared to the first quarter last year .
the upturn was mainly due to good business in the investment banking sector which had posted severe losses last year .

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .

he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.04.2009 heynckes charged with salvaging post-klinsmann bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes gave ribery and toni a good talking-to on tuesday at the age of 63 , and having coached nine other first-division clubs , bayern 's new coach jupp heynckes has lots of experience .
but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.04.2009 melting ice could accelerate global warming , says gore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears are increasingly finding less ice to live on just months before the un climate summit in copenhagen , experts and politicians have met in norway to discuss the disastrous impacts of melting ice in antarctica , the arctic and mountain areas worldwide . nobel prize laureate and climate advocate al gore said tuesday that prompt action is necessary to prevent the potentially irreversible melting of the planet 's ice .
the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .

but relations are still improving . lavrov was visiting luxembourg for a meeting of the russia-eu " permanent partnership council " , but the tone was n't always conciliatory .
in particular , russia is n't happy with the eu 's eastern partnership scheme , which seeks to tighten the bloc 's connections with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , ukraine and moldova .
the eu says the initiative is aimed at stabilizing and modernizing those six countries by encouraging free-market and pro-democracy reforms in return for eu aid .
but moscow is viewing the partnership with a wary eye .
" i have to say that some of the comments we have heard about this initiative from the european union do worry us , " lavrov told the press .
still lavrov 's remarks fell far short of comments he made in march , in which he accused the eu of trying to build up a " sphere of influence " among former soviet republics .
" he knows himself it 's nonsense , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said ahead of tuesday 's meeting .
the eu is scheduled to hold the inaugural meeting of its eastern partnership scheme in prague on may 7 . jc / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pontiff 's first stop was the village of onna where almost a sixth of the hamlet 's 300 residents were killed three weeks ago by the quake , which measured a magnitude of 6.3 on the richter scale .
" i encourage everyone , institutions and businesses , to see that this village and this region are reborn , " the pope said at a tent camp for homeless survivors outside onna .
he also said that he had made the trip to express his closeness to the people of the region in " the most direct way possible " .
pope benedict xvi later travelled to the abruzzo capital l 'aquila , 100 km north-east of rome , where he visited the ruins of the 13th century basilica of santa maria di collegmaggio , whose roof caved in during the april 6 earthquake , italy 's worst in a generation .
the head of the roman catholic church also visited a dormitory where eight students died in the disaster as well as a military academy where a mass funeral took place for 205 victims of the quake on april 10 , when pope benedict led good friday observances in rome and at the vatican .
the earthquake hit 26 towns and villages in the abruzzo region in the apennine mountains and drove around 50,000 from their homes and toppled or heavily damaged thousands of buildings across the region .
last week italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced that l 'aquila would in july host a g8 summit rather than the original choice of la maddalena , an island off sardinia . ml , rm , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.04.2009 germany gives green light to genetically modified potato trials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf says its genetically modified potato amflora is safe germany 's agriculture minister has once more fanned the debate over genetically modified crops by approving test cultivation of a genetically modified potato . germany has given the green light for further test cultivation of amflora , a genetically-modified potato manufactured by chemicals giant basf .
the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .

he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .

but relations are still improving . lavrov was visiting luxembourg for a meeting of the russia-eu " permanent partnership council " , but the tone was n't always conciliatory .
in particular , russia is n't happy with the eu 's eastern partnership scheme , which seeks to tighten the bloc 's connections with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , ukraine and moldova .
the eu says the initiative is aimed at stabilizing and modernizing those six countries by encouraging free-market and pro-democracy reforms in return for eu aid .
but moscow is viewing the partnership with a wary eye .
" i have to say that some of the comments we have heard about this initiative from the european union do worry us , " lavrov told the press .
still lavrov 's remarks fell far short of comments he made in march , in which he accused the eu of trying to build up a " sphere of influence " among former soviet republics .
" he knows himself it 's nonsense , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said ahead of tuesday 's meeting .

but relations are still improving . lavrov was visiting luxembourg for a meeting of the russia-eu " permanent partnership council " , but the tone was n't always conciliatory .
in particular , russia is n't happy with the eu 's eastern partnership scheme , which seeks to tighten the bloc 's connections with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , ukraine and moldova .
the eu says the initiative is aimed at stabilizing and modernizing those six countries by encouraging free-market and pro-democracy reforms in return for eu aid .
but moscow is viewing the partnership with a wary eye .
" i have to say that some of the comments we have heard about this initiative from the european union do worry us , " lavrov told the press .
still lavrov 's remarks fell far short of comments he made in march , in which he accused the eu of trying to build up a " sphere of influence " among former soviet republics .
" he knows himself it 's nonsense , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said ahead of tuesday 's meeting .
the eu is scheduled to hold the inaugural meeting of its eastern partnership scheme in prague on may 7 . jc / sh , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.04.2009 melting ice could accelerate global warming , says gore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears are increasingly finding less ice to live on just months before the un climate summit in copenhagen , experts and politicians have met in norway to discuss the disastrous impacts of melting ice in antarctica , the arctic and mountain areas worldwide . nobel prize laureate and climate advocate al gore said tuesday that prompt action is necessary to prevent the potentially irreversible melting of the planet 's ice .
the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .

but relations are still improving . lavrov was visiting luxembourg for a meeting of the russia-eu " permanent partnership council " , but the tone was n't always conciliatory .
in particular , russia is n't happy with the eu 's eastern partnership scheme , which seeks to tighten the bloc 's connections with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , ukraine and moldova .
the eu says the initiative is aimed at stabilizing and modernizing those six countries by encouraging free-market and pro-democracy reforms in return for eu aid .
but moscow is viewing the partnership with a wary eye .
" i have to say that some of the comments we have heard about this initiative from the european union do worry us , " lavrov told the press .
still lavrov 's remarks fell far short of comments he made in march , in which he accused the eu of trying to build up a " sphere of influence " among former soviet republics .
" he knows himself it 's nonsense , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said ahead of tuesday 's meeting .

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .

" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .
they all were aged between 18 and 20 .
" we know that two of the auschwitz prisoners who signed the message survived the camp , but their later fate is not known , " mensfeld said .
" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .
perhaps the publicity surrounding this discovery will lead to more information . "
the note was found as workers were taking down a wall in the school 's basement .
the building had belonged to the camp during nazi occupation and had served as a warehouse for the camp 's guards .

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.04.2009 germany gives green light to genetically modified potato trials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf says its genetically modified potato amflora is safe germany 's agriculture minister has once more fanned the debate over genetically modified crops by approving test cultivation of a genetically modified potato . germany has given the green light for further test cultivation of amflora , a genetically-modified potato manufactured by chemicals giant basf .
the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .
every time they have stated that amflora is as safe as conventional potatoes and therefore we expect they will come to the same conclusion again , " said johansson . nk / sh , dpa , afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .
every time they have stated that amflora is as safe as conventional potatoes and therefore we expect they will come to the same conclusion again , " said johansson . nk / sh , dpa , afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pontiff 's first stop was the village of onna where almost a sixth of the hamlet 's 300 residents were killed three weeks ago by the quake , which measured a magnitude of 6.3 on the richter scale .
" i encourage everyone , institutions and businesses , to see that this village and this region are reborn , " the pope said at a tent camp for homeless survivors outside onna .
he also said that he had made the trip to express his closeness to the people of the region in " the most direct way possible " .
pope benedict xvi later travelled to the abruzzo capital l 'aquila , 100 km north-east of rome , where he visited the ruins of the 13th century basilica of santa maria di collegmaggio , whose roof caved in during the april 6 earthquake , italy 's worst in a generation .
the head of the roman catholic church also visited a dormitory where eight students died in the disaster as well as a military academy where a mass funeral took place for 205 victims of the quake on april 10 , when pope benedict led good friday observances in rome and at the vatican .
the earthquake hit 26 towns and villages in the abruzzo region in the apennine mountains and drove around 50,000 from their homes and toppled or heavily damaged thousands of buildings across the region .
last week italian prime minister silvio berlusconi announced that l 'aquila would in july host a g8 summit rather than the original choice of la maddalena , an island off sardinia . ml , rm , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the troubled carmaker remains a bone of contention . the tone was positive after the meeting between magna executives and german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin .
guttenberg said magna had presenting " an interesting initial rough concept . "
but details of the plan , however sketchy , were not released .
the canadian daily newspaper globe and mail has reported that magna is interested in buying a 20 percent stake and possibly cooperating with russian oligarch and former magna shareholder oleg deripaska to acquire a controlling interested in the ailing automotive giant .
italian carmaker fiat has also expressed an interest in getting involved with opel . however guttenberg told reporters the two proposals were so different , it would not be possible for the two companies to work together .
political sniping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's jobs are sure to play a role in this year 's german election kurt beck , the state premier of rhineland-pfalz , where one of opel 's german plants is located , also welcomed the news of magna 's preliminary plans .
" we are convinced that this is a highly interesting offer , " beck told ap news agency , adding that he was confident a solution to opel 's problems would be found soon .
" i think that we 'll get there in june - indeed we have to . "
but he also criticized guttenberg for not fully informing german states where opel plants are located about negotiations concerning the troubled carmaker .
" we 're prepared to submit to an overarching solution , but it 's not right to let someone wander around blindly , " beck said .
the german federal government has ruled out taking a direct stake in opel , but has said it might guarantee loans for potential investors .
individual german states where opel factories are located , and where jobs could be potentially lost , are likely to get involved in any bailout plan .
guttenberg , for his part , said that no one candidate to take over opel should be favored at this point and that the future of the carmaker should not be turned into a political issue in this election year . jc / sh , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the supervisory board of deutsche bank unanimously decided to request that dr. josef ackermann should extend his contract by three years , until the annual general meeting of 2013 , " germany 's biggest bank said in a statement .
ackermann , who in february announced he would step down as scheduled in 2010 , agreed to the surprise extension , which is to be formally ratified at a board meeting on july 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were angered by ackermann 's complacency during his 2004 corruption trial the swiss national is a controversial figure in germany .
as one of the highest-paid executives in the country , he famously came under fire after a photo was taken of him making a victory-sign with his fingers at a corruption trial in 2004 in which he was acquitted .
as the financial crisis started to hit global markets , critics accused the 61-year-old of being too proud and stubborn because in contrast to other banks the manager persistently rejected state aid , saying deutsche bank was strong enough to pull out of the crisis by itself .
and indeed , the extension of ackermann 's contract is backed by surprising first quarter profits , which the bank released on tuesday .
" dr. ackermann has given deutsche bank strong strategic positioning and steered the bank safely through the crisis , " clemens boersig , chairman of the supervisory board , said in a statement .
" our performance in the first quarter 2009 is impressive evidence of this , " he added .
the frankfurt-based bank said net profit for the january-march period came in at 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.56 billion dollars -rrb- .
revenue increased by 57 percent to 7.2 billion from 4.6 billion euros compared to the first quarter last year .
the upturn was mainly due to good business in the investment banking sector which had posted severe losses last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has rejected state aid to pull through the financial crisis in 2008 , deutsche bank suffered a record net loss of 3.9 billion euros -lrb- 5.3 billion dollars -rrb- , its first loss since the bank assumed its present form in 1956 .
but the bank has said it can overcome the global financial crisis without state aid . deutsche bank is the latest global bank to report solid first quarter results , along with bank of america , goldman sachs and credit suisse , giving a glimmer of hope that the financial crisis could slowly be getting over the worst . nk , rm , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is one of the ideological leaders of the neo-nazi scene , " prosecutor stefan apostol said friday , alleging that honsik had also passed out his publications at schools .
both the prosecution and the defendant plan to appeal the verdict and sentence , austrian press agency apa reported .
the 67-year-old defendant said he rejected " the doctrine which demonizes national socialism , " but claimed he was not a national socialist himself .
honsik , who wrote the book “ acquittal for hitler ? ” in 1988 , defended himself by arguing that he did not deny the existence of all the gas chambers in nazi concentration camps .
after his lawyer herbert schaller pointed out that it was not honsik but " fine and righteous foreigners " who had first denied the existence of gas chambers , the prosecutor said he would consider whether also to indict schaller under austria 's law banning national socialist activities .
in 1992 , an austrian court had passed an 18-month prison term against honsik for denying the crimes committed by hitler 's regime .
before starting his sentence , honsik fled to spain , but he was eventually extradited in 2007 .

but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 28.04.2009 india 's election campaign haunted by history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gujarat chief minister narendra modi at a campaign rally - congress called for his resignation on tuesday two days before the third round in india ’ s parliamentary elections , the war of words between the two main political parties once again erupted .
the opposition bharatiya janata party was put on the spot when the supreme court asked for a probe into the role of gujarat ’ s chief minister narendra modi in the 2002 riots in the state .
congress meanwhile was haunted by another controversy that shook india in the 1980s . on tuesday , the central bureau of investigation -lrb- cbi -rrb- decided to strike italian businessman ottavio quatrrocchi - the only surviving suspect from the 1980s bofors gun payoff case - from its list of wanted persons .
the congress party came under all round attack .
reportedly , the 12-year interpol red corner notice , or lookout notice , against quattrocchi , was taken off the list after the cbi received legal advice from the attorney general .
just two days before round three of india ’ s five-phase elections , the move provided readymade ammunition to rival political parties .
congress is feeling jittery , says bjp campaigning in ahmedabad , bjp leader l.k. advani said that the cbi ’ s decision showed congress was feeling jittery : “ manmohan singh ’ s government wants to remove quattrocchi ’ s name from the most-wanted list .
it is doing this because it knows that after the election it is not coming back to power . ”
the case against quattrocchi , known to be close to the late rajiv gandhi , who was prime minister in 1987 when the bribery scandal broke , and his wife sonia , has taken tortuous twists and turns since the italian businessman was named by the cbi as the conduit for kickbacks .
he is accused of receiving millions of us dollars in commissions for helping to fix a $ 1.4 billion gun deal with swedish arms firm bofors in the mid-1980s .
but on tuesday , congress tried to downplay the controversy saying the bofors case was a dead horse that the bjp flogged in every election .
“ this is entirely between the government and the individual accused , ” said party spokesman abhishek manu singhvi .
“ congress has nothing whatsoever to do with it .
the point is that if there is no main issue pending against him how will you sustain the continuance of a red corner notice ?
there is nothing political about it .
it is a decision taken in law . ”
but bjp leader advani countered this opinion and said it amounted to subversion of justice .
“ this will be the last nail in the coffin of the judicial process with respect to the bofors case . ”
ghost of gujarat 2002 riots the election season has already witnessed continued slugfest between the two parties .
the ghost of the gujarat riots came back to haunt the bjp on tuesday with the supreme court ordering a probe into the role the state ’ s chief minister narendra modi , as well as 50 other politicians and government officials , had played .
the news gave fresh ammunition to congress , which was quick to demand modi 's resignation .
over 1,100 people - mostly muslims - were killed in the riots that rocked the india in 2002 .
in this long drawn out election campaign , the attacks coming from the principal political parties have been pointed and sometimes even personal .
with the final phase of polling scheduled for may 13 , the political rhetoric is only expected to get sharper . murali krishnan 28/04/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .
they all were aged between 18 and 20 .
" we know that two of the auschwitz prisoners who signed the message survived the camp , but their later fate is not known , " mensfeld said .
" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .
perhaps the publicity surrounding this discovery will lead to more information . "
the note was found as workers were taking down a wall in the school 's basement .
the building had belonged to the camp during nazi occupation and had served as a warehouse for the camp 's guards .
nazi germany established auschwitz as part of the systematic genocide against european jews during world war ii .
it 's estimated that more than one million people – mostly european jews – died in the auschwitz-birkenau camp alone .
the victims also included soviet prisoners of war , romas and anti-nazi resistance fighter from across europe . ai , rm dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news came a day after daimler said it would get rid of its final 19.9 percent stake in us auto concern chrysler . on tuesday daimler announced losses of 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- for the first quarter of 2009 , citing a decline in sales of trucks and mercedes benz cars .
the german carmaker also is to give up its last remaining stake in its former us unit chrysler and said it would forego the repayment of $ 1.5 billion of outstanding loans to the struggling detroit firm .
a statement released by daimler in stuttgart on monday said that a deal signed with chrysler and the us pension authorities marked a definitive separation of the german and us firms .
" under this agreement , daimler 's remaining 19.9 per cent shareholding in chrysler will be redeemed and daimler will forgive repayment of loans extended to chysler , which were already written off in the 2008 financial staements , " the statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 28.04.2009 europe still swooning over obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama remains hugely popular in germany as a candidate , barack obama was a pop star in europe .
thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .

" the supervisory board of deutsche bank unanimously decided to request that dr. josef ackermann should extend his contract by three years , until the annual general meeting of 2013 , " germany 's biggest bank said in a statement .
ackermann , who in february announced he would step down as scheduled in 2010 , agreed to the surprise extension , which is to be formally ratified at a board meeting on july 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were angered by ackermann 's complacency during his 2004 corruption trial the swiss national is a controversial figure in germany .
as one of the highest-paid executives in the country , he famously came under fire after a photo was taken of him making a victory-sign with his fingers at a corruption trial in 2004 in which he was acquitted .
as the financial crisis started to hit global markets , critics accused the 61-year-old of being too proud and stubborn because in contrast to other banks the manager persistently rejected state aid , saying deutsche bank was strong enough to pull out of the crisis by itself .
and indeed , the extension of ackermann 's contract is backed by surprising first quarter profits , which the bank released on tuesday .
" dr. ackermann has given deutsche bank strong strategic positioning and steered the bank safely through the crisis , " clemens boersig , chairman of the supervisory board , said in a statement .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .

but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .

it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .

he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.04.2009 heynckes charged with salvaging post-klinsmann bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes gave ribery and toni a good talking-to on tuesday at the age of 63 , and having coached nine other first-division clubs , bayern 's new coach jupp heynckes has lots of experience .
but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .

glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 28.04.2009 europe still swooning over obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama remains hugely popular in germany as a candidate , barack obama was a pop star in europe .
thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .

with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .

amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .

" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .

basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .

critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .

amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .

" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .

it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .
every time they have stated that amflora is as safe as conventional potatoes and therefore we expect they will come to the same conclusion again , " said johansson . nk / sh , dpa , afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .
they all were aged between 18 and 20 .
" we know that two of the auschwitz prisoners who signed the message survived the camp , but their later fate is not known , " mensfeld said .
" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .
perhaps the publicity surrounding this discovery will lead to more information . "
the note was found as workers were taking down a wall in the school 's basement .
the building had belonged to the camp during nazi occupation and had served as a warehouse for the camp 's guards .
nazi germany established auschwitz as part of the systematic genocide against european jews during world war ii .
it 's estimated that more than one million people – mostly european jews – died in the auschwitz-birkenau camp alone .

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .

he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .

europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.04.2009 heynckes charged with salvaging post-klinsmann bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes gave ribery and toni a good talking-to on tuesday at the age of 63 , and having coached nine other first-division clubs , bayern 's new coach jupp heynckes has lots of experience .
but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .
mette johansson , a spokeswoman for the basf plant science unit , says there is no cause for concern , and criticizes what she calls the " emotional character " of the current debate on gm crops .
an antibiotic-resistant potato " there is absolutely no risk .
it 's a very safe potato , " she says .
" the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has repeatedly stated that the potato is safe and the use of the marker gene is safe for humans , the environment and animals .
they base this on the fact that there are lots of bacteria that are resistant to the same antibiotics in normal soil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics fear amflora may jeopardize the efficiency of antibiotics however , the environmental group greenpeace remains unconvinced and even believes that basf has a hidden agenda to push for widespread commercial production of amflora , not only in the non-food sector .
" it is a complete mystery to us why this potato has again been given testing permission , especially since it has already been experimented on for the past 10 years , " said töwe .
" this new trial is definitely not a trial which will re-examine risks .
with 20 acres of field this clearly is an attempt to improve the crop yield and sooner or later this potato will end up on our plates . " basf says it plans to market amflora solely for the industrial sector .
" customers in the starch industry are waiting for this product .
they estimate that they will gain another 100-200 million euros added value every year because of the advantages that amflora gives , " said johansson .
basf says amflora is at such an advanced stage that all the scientific data needed for commercial approval have already been collected .
" we are waiting for another green light from the efsa who have examined amflora several times in the past .
every time they have stated that amflora is as safe as conventional potatoes and therefore we expect they will come to the same conclusion again , " said johansson . nk / sh , dpa , afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision of geman agriculture minister ilse aigner comes two weeks after she controversially banned a type of genetically-modified maize manufactured by us biotech giant monsanto .
critics say aigner caved in to pressure from her conservative bavarian csu party by banning mon 810 and has subsequently sought to regain favor with the conservative cdu party by approving the amflora trial .
genetically modified crops are an almost exhaustive subject which not only puts the conservative coalition parties cdu and csu at loggerheads but also leads to heated public debate .
however , experts say the mon 810 and amflora cases can not be compared although aigner did manage to rattle the cage in both cases , effectively gaining alternating criticism and applause from parties right across the political spectrum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently outlawed the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified maize mon 810 in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the recent uproar caused by the mon 810 case , basf has agreed to compromises concerning amflora , which it has not only been testing for years but for which it also received comparatively smooth approval for trials on an annual basis .
the ludwigshafen-based company has committed to additional security measures for the test cultivation of the potato , including a reduction of the area under cultivation from an initial 150 acres to 20 acres .
moreover , the cultivation will be confined to just one fenced-in field in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . a dangerous potato ?
amflora is a potato modified to produce starch consisting almost exclusively of a substance called amylopectin which is used in the paper , adhesives , textiles , construction and cosmetics industries .
however , critics warn that amflora may pose a serious health hazard , especially in view of its antibiotic resistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister ilse aigner says basf 's amflora potato is harmless the genetics expert of greenpeace germany , stephanie töwe , says amflora contains a gene that could jeopardize the life-saving properties of antibiotics .
" it is completely unnecessary to use this antibiotic in the plant and no matter how great or small the risk is , it should be avoided " , töwe said .
" the use of antibiotics in various medical areas has already led to extreme problems of resistance .
should this potato be circulated and eaten by animals and humans it is possible that so-called intestinal bacteria will become antibiotic resistant . "
in the case of amflora , a gene bearing the desired properties is coupled with a marker which is antibiotic resistant , according to basf .
the marker gene allows plants that are genetically changed in the lab to be distinguished from ones that are not .

" he is one of the ideological leaders of the neo-nazi scene , " prosecutor stefan apostol said friday , alleging that honsik had also passed out his publications at schools .
both the prosecution and the defendant plan to appeal the verdict and sentence , austrian press agency apa reported .
the 67-year-old defendant said he rejected " the doctrine which demonizes national socialism , " but claimed he was not a national socialist himself .
honsik , who wrote the book “ acquittal for hitler ? ” in 1988 , defended himself by arguing that he did not deny the existence of all the gas chambers in nazi concentration camps .
after his lawyer herbert schaller pointed out that it was not honsik but " fine and righteous foreigners " who had first denied the existence of gas chambers , the prosecutor said he would consider whether also to indict schaller under austria 's law banning national socialist activities .
in 1992 , an austrian court had passed an 18-month prison term against honsik for denying the crimes committed by hitler 's regime .
before starting his sentence , honsik fled to spain , but he was eventually extradited in 2007 .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "

" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.04.2009 heynckes charged with salvaging post-klinsmann bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes gave ribery and toni a good talking-to on tuesday at the age of 63 , and having coached nine other first-division clubs , bayern 's new coach jupp heynckes has lots of experience .
but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.04.2009 heynckes charged with salvaging post-klinsmann bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes gave ribery and toni a good talking-to on tuesday at the age of 63 , and having coached nine other first-division clubs , bayern 's new coach jupp heynckes has lots of experience .
but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

but relations are still improving . lavrov was visiting luxembourg for a meeting of the russia-eu " permanent partnership council " , but the tone was n't always conciliatory .
in particular , russia is n't happy with the eu 's eastern partnership scheme , which seeks to tighten the bloc 's connections with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , ukraine and moldova .
the eu says the initiative is aimed at stabilizing and modernizing those six countries by encouraging free-market and pro-democracy reforms in return for eu aid .
but moscow is viewing the partnership with a wary eye .
" i have to say that some of the comments we have heard about this initiative from the european union do worry us , " lavrov told the press .
still lavrov 's remarks fell far short of comments he made in march , in which he accused the eu of trying to build up a " sphere of influence " among former soviet republics .
" he knows himself it 's nonsense , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said ahead of tuesday 's meeting .

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .
they all were aged between 18 and 20 .
" we know that two of the auschwitz prisoners who signed the message survived the camp , but their later fate is not known , " mensfeld said .
" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .
perhaps the publicity surrounding this discovery will lead to more information . "
the note was found as workers were taking down a wall in the school 's basement .
the building had belonged to the camp during nazi occupation and had served as a warehouse for the camp 's guards .
nazi germany established auschwitz as part of the systematic genocide against european jews during world war ii .
it 's estimated that more than one million people – mostly european jews – died in the auschwitz-birkenau camp alone .

the pontiff 's first stop was the village of onna where almost a sixth of the hamlet 's 300 residents were killed three weeks ago by the quake , which measured a magnitude of 6.3 on the richter scale .
" i encourage everyone , institutions and businesses , to see that this village and this region are reborn , " the pope said at a tent camp for homeless survivors outside onna .

the earthquake hit 26 towns and villages in the abruzzo region in the apennine mountains and drove around 50,000 from their homes and toppled or heavily damaged thousands of buildings across the region .

but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.04.2009 melting ice could accelerate global warming , says gore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears are increasingly finding less ice to live on just months before the un climate summit in copenhagen , experts and politicians have met in norway to discuss the disastrous impacts of melting ice in antarctica , the arctic and mountain areas worldwide . nobel prize laureate and climate advocate al gore said tuesday that prompt action is necessary to prevent the potentially irreversible melting of the planet 's ice .
the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news came a day after daimler said it would get rid of its final 19.9 percent stake in us auto concern chrysler . on tuesday daimler announced losses of 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- for the first quarter of 2009 , citing a decline in sales of trucks and mercedes benz cars .
the german carmaker also is to give up its last remaining stake in its former us unit chrysler and said it would forego the repayment of $ 1.5 billion of outstanding loans to the struggling detroit firm .
a statement released by daimler in stuttgart on monday said that a deal signed with chrysler and the us pension authorities marked a definitive separation of the german and us firms .
" under this agreement , daimler 's remaining 19.9 per cent shareholding in chrysler will be redeemed and daimler will forgive repayment of loans extended to chysler , which were already written off in the 2008 financial staements , " the statement said .
daimler had sold an 80.1 per cent stake in the us carmaker to private equity company cerberus capital managment in 2007 .
under the new deal daimler has agreed to pay $ 600 million in three annual installments into chrysler 's pension coffers.the agreement is expected to reduce daimler 's second-quarter earnings before interest and tax by about $ 700 million .
in exchange chrysler and cerberus have agreed to waive any claims against daimler , including allegations that daimler " improperly managed certain issues in the period between the signing of the agreement and the conclusion of the transaction " .

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .

but relations are still improving . lavrov was visiting luxembourg for a meeting of the russia-eu " permanent partnership council " , but the tone was n't always conciliatory .
in particular , russia is n't happy with the eu 's eastern partnership scheme , which seeks to tighten the bloc 's connections with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , ukraine and moldova .
the eu says the initiative is aimed at stabilizing and modernizing those six countries by encouraging free-market and pro-democracy reforms in return for eu aid .
but moscow is viewing the partnership with a wary eye .
" i have to say that some of the comments we have heard about this initiative from the european union do worry us , " lavrov told the press .
still lavrov 's remarks fell far short of comments he made in march , in which he accused the eu of trying to build up a " sphere of influence " among former soviet republics .
" he knows himself it 's nonsense , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said ahead of tuesday 's meeting .

but the troubled carmaker remains a bone of contention . the tone was positive after the meeting between magna executives and german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg in berlin .
guttenberg said magna had presenting " an interesting initial rough concept . "
but details of the plan , however sketchy , were not released .
the canadian daily newspaper globe and mail has reported that magna is interested in buying a 20 percent stake and possibly cooperating with russian oligarch and former magna shareholder oleg deripaska to acquire a controlling interested in the ailing automotive giant .
italian carmaker fiat has also expressed an interest in getting involved with opel . however guttenberg told reporters the two proposals were so different , it would not be possible for the two companies to work together .
political sniping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's jobs are sure to play a role in this year 's german election kurt beck , the state premier of rhineland-pfalz , where one of opel 's german plants is located , also welcomed the news of magna 's preliminary plans .
" we are convinced that this is a highly interesting offer , " beck told ap news agency , adding that he was confident a solution to opel 's problems would be found soon .
" i think that we 'll get there in june - indeed we have to . "
but he also criticized guttenberg for not fully informing german states where opel plants are located about negotiations concerning the troubled carmaker .
" we 're prepared to submit to an overarching solution , but it 's not right to let someone wander around blindly , " beck said .
the german federal government has ruled out taking a direct stake in opel , but has said it might guarantee loans for potential investors .
individual german states where opel factories are located , and where jobs could be potentially lost , are likely to get involved in any bailout plan .
guttenberg , for his part , said that no one candidate to take over opel should be favored at this point and that the future of the carmaker should not be turned into a political issue in this election year . jc / sh , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .

the pontiff 's first stop was the village of onna where almost a sixth of the hamlet 's 300 residents were killed three weeks ago by the quake , which measured a magnitude of 6.3 on the richter scale .
" i encourage everyone , institutions and businesses , to see that this village and this region are reborn , " the pope said at a tent camp for homeless survivors outside onna .
he also said that he had made the trip to express his closeness to the people of the region in " the most direct way possible " .
pope benedict xvi later travelled to the abruzzo capital l 'aquila , 100 km north-east of rome , where he visited the ruins of the 13th century basilica of santa maria di collegmaggio , whose roof caved in during the april 6 earthquake , italy 's worst in a generation .
the head of the roman catholic church also visited a dormitory where eight students died in the disaster as well as a military academy where a mass funeral took place for 205 victims of the quake on april 10 , when pope benedict led good friday observances in rome and at the vatican .
the earthquake hit 26 towns and villages in the abruzzo region in the apennine mountains and drove around 50,000 from their homes and toppled or heavily damaged thousands of buildings across the region .

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .
according to the eu 's executive body , polls in the post-communist balkan country have never been certified free and fair by international observers .
in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .
albania 's bid to join the 27-member trading bloc follows the submission of a membership application by the neighbouring balkan state of montenegro in december .
nearby serbia is expected to submit an application to join the eu later this year .
this year all eu member states completed the ratification of a stabilization and association agreement signed by albania three years ago in a first step towards membership .
earlier this month albania along with croatia joined the nato security alliance .
at the opposite end of europe , iceland is widely expected to make a swift application for eu membership following elections at the weekend which saw the island 's caretaker coalition of social democrats and left-greens win a historic victory . ml / sh , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is one of the ideological leaders of the neo-nazi scene , " prosecutor stefan apostol said friday , alleging that honsik had also passed out his publications at schools .
both the prosecution and the defendant plan to appeal the verdict and sentence , austrian press agency apa reported .
the 67-year-old defendant said he rejected " the doctrine which demonizes national socialism , " but claimed he was not a national socialist himself .
honsik , who wrote the book “ acquittal for hitler ? ” in 1988 , defended himself by arguing that he did not deny the existence of all the gas chambers in nazi concentration camps .
after his lawyer herbert schaller pointed out that it was not honsik but " fine and righteous foreigners " who had first denied the existence of gas chambers , the prosecutor said he would consider whether also to indict schaller under austria 's law banning national socialist activities .
in 1992 , an austrian court had passed an 18-month prison term against honsik for denying the crimes committed by hitler 's regime .
before starting his sentence , honsik fled to spain , but he was eventually extradited in 2007 .
another prominent holocaust denier , the british writer david irving , received a sentence of two years in prison and one year of probation from austrian courts in 2006 . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but european leaders warn the country has a long road ahead of it before it 's ready to join the bloc . albania has formally submitted an application to join the european union despite a call from the european commission to wait until after elections in june .
albanian prime minister sali berisha submitted the application in prague to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
welcoming the membership bid , topolanek said : " there is a long way ahead for albania and i hope it will be crowned with success . "
berisha described the application as the " number one priority for the entire country . "
the commission had urged albania , one of europe 's poorest countries , to wait until after parliamentary elections on 28 june before submitting its application .

in a report released in november , the european commission said that albania needed to make more progress in strengthening the state administration and courts as well as fighting organized crime and corruption .

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.04.2009 melting ice could accelerate global warming , says gore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears are increasingly finding less ice to live on just months before the un climate summit in copenhagen , experts and politicians have met in norway to discuss the disastrous impacts of melting ice in antarctica , the arctic and mountain areas worldwide . nobel prize laureate and climate advocate al gore said tuesday that prompt action is necessary to prevent the potentially irreversible melting of the planet 's ice .
the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is one of the ideological leaders of the neo-nazi scene , " prosecutor stefan apostol said friday , alleging that honsik had also passed out his publications at schools .
both the prosecution and the defendant plan to appeal the verdict and sentence , austrian press agency apa reported .
the 67-year-old defendant said he rejected " the doctrine which demonizes national socialism , " but claimed he was not a national socialist himself .
honsik , who wrote the book “ acquittal for hitler ? ” in 1988 , defended himself by arguing that he did not deny the existence of all the gas chambers in nazi concentration camps .
after his lawyer herbert schaller pointed out that it was not honsik but " fine and righteous foreigners " who had first denied the existence of gas chambers , the prosecutor said he would consider whether also to indict schaller under austria 's law banning national socialist activities .
in 1992 , an austrian court had passed an 18-month prison term against honsik for denying the crimes committed by hitler 's regime .
before starting his sentence , honsik fled to spain , but he was eventually extradited in 2007 .
another prominent holocaust denier , the british writer david irving , received a sentence of two years in prison and one year of probation from austrian courts in 2006 . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the note is signed by seven inmates , some of who are believed to have survived . the message was hidden for almost 65 years .
a note in a bottle stuck behind concrete written by seven desperate inmates of the nazi 's auschwitz concentration camp . the message in a bottle was discovered by workers renovating an old school building in the southern polish town of oswiecim , the site of the infamous nazi german death camp .
" these were young people who tried to leave at least some sort of proof of their existence , " said jaroslav mensfelt , historian with the auschwitz-birkenau museum .
written in pencil on a rolled up piece of paper the note is dated september 9 , 1944 .
it gives the names , camp numbers and hometown of the seven prisoners : six from poland and one from france .
they all were aged between 18 and 20 .
" we know that two of the auschwitz prisoners who signed the message survived the camp , but their later fate is not known , " mensfeld said .
" if they are alive , they would be in their eighties now .
perhaps the publicity surrounding this discovery will lead to more information . "
the note was found as workers were taking down a wall in the school 's basement .
the building had belonged to the camp during nazi occupation and had served as a warehouse for the camp 's guards .
nazi germany established auschwitz as part of the systematic genocide against european jews during world war ii .
it 's estimated that more than one million people – mostly european jews – died in the auschwitz-birkenau camp alone .
the victims also included soviet prisoners of war , romas and anti-nazi resistance fighter from across europe . ai , rm dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

" he is one of the ideological leaders of the neo-nazi scene , " prosecutor stefan apostol said friday , alleging that honsik had also passed out his publications at schools .
both the prosecution and the defendant plan to appeal the verdict and sentence , austrian press agency apa reported .
the 67-year-old defendant said he rejected " the doctrine which demonizes national socialism , " but claimed he was not a national socialist himself .
honsik , who wrote the book “ acquittal for hitler ? ” in 1988 , defended himself by arguing that he did not deny the existence of all the gas chambers in nazi concentration camps .
after his lawyer herbert schaller pointed out that it was not honsik but " fine and righteous foreigners " who had first denied the existence of gas chambers , the prosecutor said he would consider whether also to indict schaller under austria 's law banning national socialist activities .
in 1992 , an austrian court had passed an 18-month prison term against honsik for denying the crimes committed by hitler 's regime .
before starting his sentence , honsik fled to spain , but he was eventually extradited in 2007 .
another prominent holocaust denier , the british writer david irving , received a sentence of two years in prison and one year of probation from austrian courts in 2006 . dfm , nw dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 28.04.2009 india 's election campaign haunted by history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gujarat chief minister narendra modi at a campaign rally - congress called for his resignation on tuesday two days before the third round in india ’ s parliamentary elections , the war of words between the two main political parties once again erupted .
the opposition bharatiya janata party was put on the spot when the supreme court asked for a probe into the role of gujarat ’ s chief minister narendra modi in the 2002 riots in the state .
congress meanwhile was haunted by another controversy that shook india in the 1980s . on tuesday , the central bureau of investigation -lrb- cbi -rrb- decided to strike italian businessman ottavio quatrrocchi - the only surviving suspect from the 1980s bofors gun payoff case - from its list of wanted persons .
the congress party came under all round attack .
reportedly , the 12-year interpol red corner notice , or lookout notice , against quattrocchi , was taken off the list after the cbi received legal advice from the attorney general .
just two days before round three of india ’ s five-phase elections , the move provided readymade ammunition to rival political parties .
congress is feeling jittery , says bjp campaigning in ahmedabad , bjp leader l.k. advani said that the cbi ’ s decision showed congress was feeling jittery : “ manmohan singh ’ s government wants to remove quattrocchi ’ s name from the most-wanted list .
it is doing this because it knows that after the election it is not coming back to power . ”
the case against quattrocchi , known to be close to the late rajiv gandhi , who was prime minister in 1987 when the bribery scandal broke , and his wife sonia , has taken tortuous twists and turns since the italian businessman was named by the cbi as the conduit for kickbacks .
he is accused of receiving millions of us dollars in commissions for helping to fix a $ 1.4 billion gun deal with swedish arms firm bofors in the mid-1980s .
but on tuesday , congress tried to downplay the controversy saying the bofors case was a dead horse that the bjp flogged in every election .
“ this is entirely between the government and the individual accused , ” said party spokesman abhishek manu singhvi .
“ congress has nothing whatsoever to do with it .
the point is that if there is no main issue pending against him how will you sustain the continuance of a red corner notice ?
there is nothing political about it .
it is a decision taken in law . ”
but bjp leader advani countered this opinion and said it amounted to subversion of justice .
“ this will be the last nail in the coffin of the judicial process with respect to the bofors case . ”
ghost of gujarat 2002 riots the election season has already witnessed continued slugfest between the two parties .
the ghost of the gujarat riots came back to haunt the bjp on tuesday with the supreme court ordering a probe into the role the state ’ s chief minister narendra modi , as well as 50 other politicians and government officials , had played .
the news gave fresh ammunition to congress , which was quick to demand modi 's resignation .
over 1,100 people - mostly muslims - were killed in the riots that rocked the india in 2002 .
in this long drawn out election campaign , the attacks coming from the principal political parties have been pointed and sometimes even personal .
with the final phase of polling scheduled for may 13 , the political rhetoric is only expected to get sharper . murali krishnan 28/04/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .

" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.04.2009 heynckes charged with salvaging post-klinsmann bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes gave ribery and toni a good talking-to on tuesday at the age of 63 , and having coached nine other first-division clubs , bayern 's new coach jupp heynckes has lots of experience .
but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

but it may take more than that to clean up the mess klinsi made in munich . the curiosity about what the veteran heynckes holds in store for the reigning but faltering bundesliga champs was so great that germany 's leading tabloid , bild , ran a live ticker covering his first day on the job .
and as if to give an indication of what 's to come , his most notable action was to tell stars luca toni and frank ribery to quit messing around after a bit of practice pitch tomfoolery .
the message is clear : clown time is over .
having won the league twice from 1989-1991 during a previous stint at bayern 's helm , heynckes has been brought in to restore order , ensure munich qualify for the champions league and , if possible , engineer a last-minute fight-back to take the bundesliga title .
a tall order with only four remaining weeks remaining in the season .
and to fill it , heynckes is going to need not only to institute a new post-klinsmann culture , but to break a few negative streaks of his own .
so can he save bayern ?
and if so how ?
personnel shake-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes should give more playing time to german nationals schweini and poldi the tactical void under klinsmann extended so far that once-mighty bayern forgot basics such as spreading the field .
that meant they over-relied on the individual talents of toni and ribery .
opponents could double- and triple-team both stars , creating the sort of frustration that ribery vented in getting himself sent off in last weekend 's 1-nil , klinsi-crushing loss to schalke .
expect heynckes - a former striker who played for moenchengladbach and the bundesliga 's all-time third-leading scorer - to put more offensive firepower on the pitch , probably going with two attacking forwards instead of one .
that would mean a second chance for lukas podolski , whom klinsmann for some reason seemed determined to reduce to the role of apathetic reserve .
and it also probably entails the end of the line for the non-entities - lell , ottl and sosa - whom munich fielded in its home humiliation by schalke .
the most immediate problem is that ribery is suspended for one match after picking up that red card .
players like hamit altintop and above all bastian schweinsteiger are going to have to shoulder more of the immediate load .
but a big question - one that 's the key to bayern 's late-season gamble - remains .
can heynckes convince his new charges to get on with the program ?
poor track record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heynckes left gladbach in 2007 with a monkey on his back heyncke 's most recent results in the bundesliga are nothing to write home about , and no one has ever accused him of being a master communicator .
indeed , he got along so badly with a trio of stars at frankfurt , which he coached from 1994 to 1995 , that they went on strike , refusing to play at all .
although he did win the champions league with real madrid in 1998 , he was fired after one season for getting poor results in the spanish domestic league .
the same was true with heynckes and schalke in 2004 - minus , of course , the champions league title .
and returning to gladbach for the 2006-7 campaign , heynckes started the season with four victories , after which the team failed to win another game .
heynckes stepped down in january , and gladbach were relegated .
bayern munich gives him more talent to work with than most of his previous employers , but heynckes will no doubt be nervous about getting his first three points to break his own personal winless streak .
and in one of those ironic twists to which the gods of football seem to be addicted , heyncke 's first opponents with his new team are the squad with whom he himself is most closely associated - moenchengladbach .

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates .

he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .

us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

but relations are still improving . lavrov was visiting luxembourg for a meeting of the russia-eu " permanent partnership council " , but the tone was n't always conciliatory .
in particular , russia is n't happy with the eu 's eastern partnership scheme , which seeks to tighten the bloc 's connections with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , ukraine and moldova .
the eu says the initiative is aimed at stabilizing and modernizing those six countries by encouraging free-market and pro-democracy reforms in return for eu aid .
but moscow is viewing the partnership with a wary eye .
" i have to say that some of the comments we have heard about this initiative from the european union do worry us , " lavrov told the press .
still lavrov 's remarks fell far short of comments he made in march , in which he accused the eu of trying to build up a " sphere of influence " among former soviet republics .
" he knows himself it 's nonsense , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said ahead of tuesday 's meeting .

" the supervisory board of deutsche bank unanimously decided to request that dr. josef ackermann should extend his contract by three years , until the annual general meeting of 2013 , " germany 's biggest bank said in a statement .
ackermann , who in february announced he would step down as scheduled in 2010 , agreed to the surprise extension , which is to be formally ratified at a board meeting on july 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans were angered by ackermann 's complacency during his 2004 corruption trial the swiss national is a controversial figure in germany .
as one of the highest-paid executives in the country , he famously came under fire after a photo was taken of him making a victory-sign with his fingers at a corruption trial in 2004 in which he was acquitted .
as the financial crisis started to hit global markets , critics accused the 61-year-old of being too proud and stubborn because in contrast to other banks the manager persistently rejected state aid , saying deutsche bank was strong enough to pull out of the crisis by itself .
and indeed , the extension of ackermann 's contract is backed by surprising first quarter profits , which the bank released on tuesday .
" dr. ackermann has given deutsche bank strong strategic positioning and steered the bank safely through the crisis , " clemens boersig , chairman of the supervisory board , said in a statement .
" our performance in the first quarter 2009 is impressive evidence of this , " he added .
the frankfurt-based bank said net profit for the january-march period came in at 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.56 billion dollars -rrb- .
revenue increased by 57 percent to 7.2 billion from 4.6 billion euros compared to the first quarter last year .
the upturn was mainly due to good business in the investment banking sector which had posted severe losses last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has rejected state aid to pull through the financial crisis in 2008 , deutsche bank suffered a record net loss of 3.9 billion euros -lrb- 5.3 billion dollars -rrb- , its first loss since the bank assumed its present form in 1956 .
but the bank has said it can overcome the global financial crisis without state aid . deutsche bank is the latest global bank to report solid first quarter results , along with bank of america , goldman sachs and credit suisse , giving a glimmer of hope that the financial crisis could slowly be getting over the worst . nk , rm , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former us vice president co-chaired a conference devoted to melting ice in the town of tromso in northern norway .
gore told foreign ministers and climate change scientists that the ice was melting faster in the arctic and in greenland than the worst-case projections by experts a few years ago .
" the ice is also melting in west antarctica and in mountainous regions across the globe , " gore said .
" this conference is a global wake-up call . "
the scientific evidence for action at the un climate summit in copenhagen in december was continuing to build up week by week , he said .
norway 's foreign minister jonas gahr stoere said peaceful cooperation in the arctic was crucial , as the region 's five bordering countries vie for potentially lucrative natural resources .
" high north , low tension , " stoere told reporters .
" we will , as responsible governments and coastal states , be able to manage the challenges and opportunities of this region without gliding into conflict and negative competition . "
glacial melting will hit the most vulnerable according to gore , ice reflects 90 percent of the sun 's radiation back into the atmosphere .
if the ice were to melt , the dark water would not reflect the heat but instead absorb it , thereby accentuating the effect of global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs are melting at an alarming rate " as it disappears , we have to keep in mind that it can come back only if we act fairly quickly , " said gore , who shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change .
" if we keep turning the temperature of the earth up , then the heat will go to the lower depths of the arctic ocean and it will be impossible for the ice to come back , " gore added .
but increased glacial melting in the himalayas and the tibetan plateau as well as of land glaciers elsewhere in the world would also have detrimental effects for millions of people , stoere said .
" some of the first and most painful impacts of melting ice will be felt there among some of the most vulnerable populations of the world , " stoere said .
" as these glaciers melt , some of the world 's poorest will experience floods from increased melt water , and then water shortages that will devastate local agriculture and drinking supplies . "
populations in south asia could suffer from flooding not only from the melting of the himalayas , but also from rising sea levels due to ice melting at the poles , he said .
gore said that each one-meter rise of water levels will cause 100 million people to become climate refugees .
reducing soot could decelerate ice melt stoere said cutting soot emissions might slow the trend .
soot and other fine particles released by fires and diesel motors in eastern europe and asia are carried by the wind to the arctic .
they cover the ice in a thin sheet , which increases its absorption of solar rays and accelerates the ice melt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel fumes also harm the arctic ice " since they have such short lifetimes , from a few days for black carbon to a decade for methane , reductions in these pollutants would show an early climate response , " stoere said .
" it might give regions of ice and snow a chance to survive long enough for greenhouse gas reductions to have an impact . "
following the conference , a working group will write a report to raise awareness among decision-makers about the issue of melting ice ahead of the copenhagen summit .
on wednesday , norway hosts the arctic council 's annual ministerial meeting in tromso .
members of the arctic council are the united states , russia , canada , sweden , denmark including greenland and the faroe islands , finland , iceland and norway .
this week , the united states invited china , india and the world 's other top greenhouse gas polluters to washington to lay the groundwork for a un deal to fight climate change . sac / sh , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the opening of a conference in washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton told diplomats from the world 's 16 largest economies that her country was now ready to lead the fight against global climate change .
president barack obama " and his entire administration are committed to addressing this issue and we will act , " clinton told delegates from major european countries , china , india , indonesia and other powers .
" the united states is fully engaged and ready to lead and determined to make up for lost time both at home and abroad , " she said .
in an apparent reference to criticism of us environmental policy under previous president george w. bush , clinton said : " the united states is no longer absent without leave . "
the two-day conference is the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of a december deadline , when the international community meets in copenhagen to find a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol , which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 .
bush had opposed the kyoto protocol and any other across-the-board limits on greenhouse gas emissions , saying the agreement unfairly exempted quickly growing economies such as china and india and would hurt the us economy .
the talks in washington this week are not expected to lead to any concrete agreements , but the change of tone from the us has been welcomed by european delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siegmar gabriel welcomed clinton 's comments on climate change german environment minister sigmar gabriel hailed the us turnaround , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection . "
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said . italian environment minister stefania prestigiacomo said clinton 's words " erased all doubts " about the willingness of the obama administration to support the climate fight .
she told reporters that china , too , had shown a more positive approach in the meeting .
" usually the attitude of china was more the attitude of a country asking for something , " she said .
" this time -lrb- there -rrb- was ... a willingness to give a contribution to the process . "
europe pushing for us carbon reduction targets europe , disillusioned with the environmental policy of the previous us administration , has in particular been looking for new us leadership on fighting climate change .
european leaders were often exasperated by washington 's failure to commit to climate change targets , especially because europe has set itself ambitious goals .
eu nations have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels , rising to 30 percent if the rest of the developed world - mainly the united states and japan - agrees to do so .
while obama has promised to " be an active partner in the copenhagen process and beyond , " the us emissions reduction pledges have so far stopped short of the eu goals .
on monday obama told the us national academy of sciences : " our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution . "
the us house of representatives recently received a draft bill for clean energy development which aims to cut carbon emissions by 20 percent from their 2005 levels by 2020 and boost reliance on renewable sources of energy .
should the draft bill face too much opposition or watering down , obama 's administration may still be able to bypass congress in regulating carbon emissions , by ruling through its environmental protection agency that greenhouse gases threaten us air quality and public health .
that decision must be submitted for public comment for 60 days before being finalized , and would allow the government to regulate industry emissions of six greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide , under existing clean air laws without additional congressional approval .
however , the white house has said it would prefer to wait for lawmakers to agree on a way forward .
planned carbon cuts may be insufficient although the us targets were unheard of before obama took over from his predecessor george bush , they were only given a cautious welcome in europe because the base year for comparisons is 15 years after that of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is hoping that the us will agree to serious cuts to carbon dioxide emissions the europeans hope washington will be prepared to shoulder more of the burden since the new us goals would represent just a five to six percent reduction using the eu 's baseline of 1990 , according to eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
gabriel has also expressed hope that the us will commit to more ambitious and binding climate targets , adding that large developing nations such as china , india , brazil and south africa would only be prepared to make an effort themselves if washington took the lead .
while the world is waiting for what washington may pull out of the hat , concerns over the effects of global warming are rising persistently with environmentalists and climate experts warning that even the targets envisaged by the eu may not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
citing the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the un 's top climate change official , yvo de boer , has warned that rich nations must aim for carbon pollution cuts of up to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
although environmentalists and experts have warned that insufficient action will cost the global economy far more dearly than concrete measures now , the debate on how to pay for alleviating the effects of global warming is far from over .
according to eu estimates , 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 232 billion -rrb- will have to be spent each year up to 2020 to mitigate those effects , half of it by developing countries .
the bloc 's environment ministers agreed in march to use revenues from carbon credit auctions to mitigate the effects of climate change .
however , against the backdrop of the economic crisis , eu officials have been reluctant to put forward the 27-member bloc 's financial pledge before other big players present their commitments .
environmentalists have likened this approach to the chicken and egg problem , urging all participants to put their cards on the table immediately and not wait for others to do so first . ml , rm reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands cheered during his speech in berlin last year .
now that he is president , much has changed for obama , but one thing has n't : his popularity in europe . when it comes to popularity , only the dalai lama poses any competition for the us president .
but even the tibetan spiritual leader ultimately is no match for barack obama .
according to an international poll by harris interactive , conducted in the five largest european countries and the us and published in early april , 80 percent of adults in the countries polled have a good opinion of the american president .
the dalai lama comes in second with 74 percent .
german chancellor angela merkel , as the most popular european leader , takes third place with 52 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large crowds came to see barack obama during his speech in prague obama remains popular at home as well , but his international appeal dwarfs his domestic favorability ratings .
in all five european countries -lrb- germany , france , britain , italy , spain -rrb- , obama scored higher than in the us .
and so far , there seems no end in sight for europe 's obama swoon .
on a recent trip to prague , the czech daily mlada fronta dnes led with the headline " the o-day , " and the british guardian this week lauded obama 's " epoch-defining 100 days . " change in style and substance while obama 's continued popularity could n't necessarily be expected , it can be explained . " we got the man we wanted , " says marcin zaborowski , of the european union 's institute for security studies .
" he has initiated change in many different areas ranging from relations with iran and russia to the closing of guantanamo and the withdrawal from iraq .
that 's why europeans have lots of reasons to be happy about the first months of the obama administration . "
what 's more , with his charm offensive and overtures towards european leaders during his first official visit to the continent a few weeks ago , obama has certainly made it difficult for europeans not to like him .
he has also been careful to recognize the political sensibilities of his allies and to avoid the harsh rhetoric of his predecessor .
but , argues fabrice pothier , director of the carnegie endowment for international peace europe , obama is still in the early phase of promises and not yet in the phase of delivery which will probably start next year .
still , obama deserves a very good grade for his first 100 days , says pothier , because he really intends to change not just the style , but also the substance of u.s. foreign policy . possible problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama announced his new strategy for afghanistan in march despite the continuing honeymoon between the europeans and obama , experts warn of underlying problems in transatlantic relations .
with his new afghanistan policy , obama has put pressure on some european countries , especially germany , to do more , says zaborowski .
" but since the europeans are not willing to commit a substantial number of additional troops to afghanistan , the us will have twice as many troops there as its allies .
originally , there used to be parity .
that is not a good sign for us-european relations and for nato . "
fabrice pothier , director of carnegie europe , detects a large gap between public sentiment towards obama and political action in europe .
" so far , obama has mostly met his expectations , but europe 's governments have n't done their part .
angela merkel and gordon brown , two of europe 's most important leaders , are in election mode and have n't shown much enthusiasm to help obama . "
nicholas sarkozy is also not an easy partner for obama , says pothier , and the eu does n't speak with one voice and is therefore also not a reliable player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and angela merkel have their focus on national elections too much , too fast on certain issues , obama ironically turns out to be more european than the europeans themselves , argues zaborowski .
" his move to seriously engage iran , which europe has always demanded from washington , was not greeted with full enthusiasm by all european countries .
instead , france and others have called upon the us not to do too much too fast . " in the long run , this lopsidedness consisting of active us leadership and reluctant european followers could hurt european-american relations , the experts point out .
barack obama is not a president who is naturally inclined towards europe , stresses pothier .
his natural focus lies in asia , but he has shown a lot of goodwill and has also learned to manage his expectations towards europe .
" but we really must do more to help obama , especially fighting the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
if europe continues to fail to deliver , obama at some point will be forced to look elsewhere for partners . "

he said however he was still highly optimistic that a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol - which limits greenhouse gas emissions and expires in 2012 - could be reached at an international climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
the two-day washington conference was the latest in a series of meetings meant to jump-start climate talks in advance of the december meeting .
gabriel hailed an apparent turnaround in the us approach to fighting climate change , saying he was glad " the americans are no longer standing aside but are participating actively in negotiations about climate protection .
" the atmosphere in the negotiations is completely different from how it used to be under the previous us administration , " he said .
but gabriel said it was an " open question " as to whether and to what extent emerging economies would engage in setting obligatory emissions reduction goals .
" today there was no movement in this respect .
it still is an open question if the emerging countries are ready for binding agreements , " he said .
rising economic powers such as china and india argue that rich , industrialized nations should assume the majority of the costs of climate protection .
europe still shepherd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the us has come a long way gabriel said europe was still leading the way in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
he said he could " confidently say that the us is still far away " from playing a leadership role on the global warming issue .
he said a lot had changed since the bush era but that greater commitments from industrialized nations , including the us , would be necessary to seal a global deal .
" it was very clear that the americans are moving a lot , " he told reporters during a break from the meeting .
" measured by what europeans believe needs to be done to fight climate change , we 're still very far apart from each other . "
us president barack obama wants cuts in us emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases of around 15 percent by 2020 .
this would bring us emissions back to 1990 levels .
the eu has promised a 20 percent cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 , and has said it would target a 30 percent cut if other developed nations also pledged to do so .
" europe still has this leadership role , but we would happily share it with the americans , " gabriel said .

gordon brown 's plan to replace it with a flat-rate daily allowance failed to win support from the tories , lib dems and many backbench labour mps .
the prime minister said " swift reform " was still needed and asked standards watchdog sir christopher kelly to bring forward his report on expenses to july .
but sir christopher warned that the issues involved were " not simple " .
mps will still vote on thursday on other plans for reform put forward by the government .
' soon as possible ' the tories and lib dems have argued that an attendance allowance which does not require receipts is less transparent than the current system .
the independent inquiry by sir christopher 's committee on standards in public life is due to report back by the end of this year . "
i continue to highly value the role of the committee on standards in public life and look forward to your report on all aspects of mps ' allowances " gordon brown brown expenses letter : full text in his letter to sir christopher , mr brown said : " the government remains determined to move to an allowance system that is fair , transparent and less costly than the current system . "
he also said : " you will also be aware that a consensus has not been reached on the future of the personal additional accommodation expenditure for mps .
but we are agreed on the need for swift reform .
" therefore i would ask the committee on standards in public life to come forward with its proposals on this issue as soon as possible and preferably before the summer recess , taking into account mps ' attendance at westminster , the need for transparency and accountability and the desire to reduce the existing limits on the allowances which mps may claim , producing overall cost savings . "
he added : " i continue to highly value the role of the committee on standards in public life and look forward to your report on all aspects of mps ' allowances . "
' frustrating episode ' but in his reply , sir christopher said the issues were " not simple " and that " making recommendations based on evidence is key if we are to put forward a workable and credible package of changes " .
he added : " we aim to complete our review as early as we can consistent with doing a thorough job . "
bbc political correspondent gary o 'donoghue said that " while the prime minister was trying to seize the initiative on expenses , he has ended up looking powerless " .
" this is proving to be a frustrating episode for gordon brown , " our correspondent said .
the commons debate and vote on thursday will now concentrate on other proposals made by mr brown last week .
these include increasing transparency around mps ' outside earnings and ending claims for second homes from mps with constituencies in greater london from 2010 .
the government also wants mps to provide receipts to support all expenses claims by removing the current £ 25 lower threshold .
' climbdown ' mr brown proposes giving a senior group of mps , the members estimate committee , the power to amend the green book governing rules on mps ' expenses .
mps ' staff should be centrally employed by the house of commons itself , rather than individual members , he added in his letter .
conservative leader david cameron said : " what we 've seen from the prime minister is a u-turn , followed by a climbdown , and now descending into farce .
" he is ducking the issue which people want dealt with , which is a cleaned up system of expenses so we stop the business of mps claiming for televisions , patio heaters and the rest of it . "
liberal democrat leader nick clegg said : " this leaves us with the worst of both worlds .
" the most important issue of all has been kicked into the long grass , while parliament will be left discussing other relatively minor issues .
" gordon brown did n't get his way with his proposal to pay mps for turning up so he is denying us any chance to debate the issue of second homes .
it 's like a sulking child packing up his bat and ball and going home . "
' clocking on ' mr brown 's plan to replace the controversial second homes allowance - worth up to £ 24,000 a year to mps representing seats outside inner london - failed to win support among opposition parties .
it came as a surprise to many when it was announced on the downing street website last week .
but it was quickly criticised by the tories and liberal democrats , who said a " clocking on " allowance amounted to a " cheque for turning up to work " and was much criticised where it operated in the european parliament .
sir christopher also said people would have " great difficulty in the notion that claims for the reimbursement of expenses should not need to be backed by receipts " .
asked on monday if the plan for a flat-rate allowance was dead , commons leader harriet harman said : " no , not at all . "
in july all mps ' expenses claims , with receipts , dating back to 2004 are due to be published after a long freedom of information battle .

gordon brown 's plan to replace it with a flat-rate daily allowance failed to win support from the tories , lib dems and many backbench labour mps .
the prime minister said " swift reform " was still needed and asked standards watchdog sir christopher kelly to bring forward his report on expenses to july .
but sir christopher warned that the issues involved were " not simple " .
mps will still vote on thursday on other plans for reform put forward by the government .
' soon as possible ' the tories and lib dems have argued that an attendance allowance which does not require receipts is less transparent than the current system .
the independent inquiry by sir christopher 's committee on standards in public life is due to report back by the end of this year .
i continue to highly value the role of the committee on standards in public life and look forward to your report on all aspects of mps ' allowances gordon brown brown expenses letter : full text in his letter to sir christopher , mr brown said : " the government remains determined to move to an allowance system that is fair , transparent and less costly than the current system . "
he also said : " you will also be aware that a consensus has not been reached on the future of the personal additional accommodation expenditure for mps .
but we are agreed on the need for swift reform .
" therefore i would ask the committee on standards in public life to come forward with its proposals on this issue as soon as possible and preferably before the summer recess , taking into account mps ' attendance at westminster , the need for transparency and accountability and the desire to reduce the existing limits on the allowances which mps may claim , producing overall cost savings . "
he added : " i continue to highly value the role of the committee on standards in public life and look forward to your report on all aspects of mps ' allowances . "
' frustrating episode ' but in his reply , sir christopher said the issues were " not simple " and that " making recommendations based on evidence is key if we are to put forward a workable and credible package of changes " .
he added : " we aim to complete our review as early as we can consistent with doing a thorough job . "
bbc political correspondent gary o 'donoghue said that " while the prime minister was trying to seize the initiative on expenses , he has ended up looking powerless " .
" this is proving to be a frustrating episode for gordon brown , " our correspondent said .
the commons debate and vote on thursday will now concentrate on other proposals made by mr brown last week .
these include increasing transparency around mps ' outside earnings and ending claims for second homes from mps with constituencies in greater london from 2010 .
the government also wants mps to provide receipts to support all expenses claims by removing the current £ 25 lower threshold .
' climbdown ' mr brown proposes giving a senior group of mps , the members estimate committee , the power to amend the green book governing rules on mps ' expenses .
mps ' staff should be centrally employed by the house of commons itself , rather than individual members , he added in his letter .
conservative leader david cameron said : " what we 've seen from the prime minister is a u-turn , followed by a climbdown , and now descending into farce .
" he is ducking the issue which people want dealt with , which is a cleaned up system of expenses so we stop the business of mps claiming for televisions , patio heaters and the rest of it . "
liberal democrat leader nick clegg said : " this leaves us with the worst of both worlds .
" the most important issue of all has been kicked into the long grass , while parliament will be left discussing other relatively minor issues .
" gordon brown did n't get his way with his proposal to pay mps for turning up so he is denying us any chance to debate the issue of second homes .
it 's like a sulking child packing up his bat and ball and going home . "
' clocking on ' mr brown 's plan to replace the controversial second homes allowance - worth up to £ 24,000 a year to mps representing seats outside inner london - failed to win support among opposition parties .
it came as a surprise to many when it was announced on the downing street website last week .
but it was quickly criticised by the tories and liberal democrats , who said a " clocking on " allowance amounted to a " cheque for turning up to work " and was much criticised where it operated in the european parliament .
sir christopher also said people would have " great difficulty in the notion that claims for the reimbursement of expenses should not need to be backed by receipts " .
asked on monday if the plan for a flat-rate allowance was dead , commons leader harriet harman said : " no , not at all . "
in july all mps ' expenses claims , with receipts , dating back to 2004 are due to be published after a long freedom of information battle .

gordon brown 's plan to replace it with a flat-rate daily allowance failed to win support from the tories , lib dems and many backbench labour mps .
the prime minister said " swift reform " was still needed and asked standards watchdog sir christopher kelly to bring forward his report on expenses to july .
but sir christopher warned that the issues involved were " not simple " .
mps will still vote on thursday on other plans for reform put forward by the government .
' soon as possible ' the tories and lib dems have argued that an attendance allowance which does not require receipts is less transparent than the current system .
the independent inquiry by sir christopher 's committee on standards in public life is due to report back by the end of this year .
i continue to highly value the role of the committee on standards in public life and look forward to your report on all aspects of mps ' allowances gordon brown brown expenses letter : full text in his letter to sir christopher , mr brown said : " the government remains determined to move to an allowance system that is fair , transparent and less costly than the current system . "
he also said : " you will also be aware that a consensus has not been reached on the future of the personal additional accommodation expenditure for mps .
but we are agreed on the need for swift reform .
" therefore i would ask the committee on standards in public life to come forward with its proposals on this issue as soon as possible and preferably before the summer recess , taking into account mps ' attendance at westminster , the need for transparency and accountability and the desire to reduce the existing limits on the allowances which mps may claim , producing overall cost savings . "
he added : " i continue to highly value the role of the committee on standards in public life and look forward to your report on all aspects of mps ' allowances . "
' frustrating episode ' but in his reply , sir christopher said the issues were " not simple " and that " making recommendations based on evidence is key if we are to put forward a workable and credible package of changes " .
he added : " we aim to complete our review as early as we can consistent with doing a thorough job . "
bbc political correspondent gary o 'donoghue said that " while the prime minister was trying to seize the initiative on expenses , he has ended up looking powerless " .
" this is proving to be a frustrating episode for gordon brown , " our correspondent said .
the commons debate and vote on thursday will now concentrate on other proposals made by mr brown last week .
these include increasing transparency around mps ' outside earnings and ending claims for second homes from mps with constituencies in greater london from 2010 .
the government also wants mps to provide receipts to support all expenses claims by removing the current £ 25 lower threshold .
' climbdown ' mr brown proposes giving a senior group of mps , the members estimate committee , the power to amend the green book governing rules on mps ' expenses .
mps ' staff should be centrally employed by the house of commons itself , rather than individual members , he added in his letter .
conservative leader david cameron said : " what we 've seen from the prime minister is a u-turn , followed by a climbdown , and now descending into farce .
" he is ducking the issue which people want dealt with , which is a cleaned up system of expenses so we stop the business of mps claiming for televisions , patio heaters and the rest of it . "
liberal democrat leader nick clegg said : " this leaves us with the worst of both worlds .
" the most important issue of all has been kicked into the long grass , while parliament will be left discussing other relatively minor issues .
" gordon brown did n't get his way with his proposal to pay mps for turning up so he is denying us any chance to debate the issue of second homes .
it 's like a sulking child packing up his bat and ball and going home . "
' clocking on ' mr brown 's plan to replace the controversial second homes allowance - worth up to £ 24,000 a year to mps representing seats outside inner london - failed to win support among opposition parties .
it came as a surprise to many when it was announced on the downing street website last week .

researchers say seas are becoming more acidic as a result of co2 from human activities being absorbed by seawater , which alters the oceans ' chemistry .
ministers say acidification of the oceans will be one of the major environmental concerns of this century .
the study will focus on the atlantic , antarctic and arctic oceans and assess how marine ecosystems are affected .
the programme , co-funded by the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- and the natural environment research council -lrb- nerc -rrb- , will also examine the implications for people and the economy .
up to 50 % of the co2 released by burning fossil fuels over the past 200 years has been absorbed by world 's oceans this has lowered the ph value of seawater - the measure of acidity and alkalinity - by 0.1 the vast majority of liquids lie between ph 0 -lrb- very acidic -rrb- and ph 14 -lrb- very alkaline -rrb- ; 7 is neutral seawater is mildly alkaline with a " natural " ph of about 8.2 the ipcc forecasts that ocean ph will fall by " between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century , adding to the present decrease of 0.1 units since pre-industrial times " natural lab shows sea 's acid path what is ocean acidification ?
" ocean acidification will be one of the biggest environmental concerns of this century , with major and far-reaching impacts , " said nature and marine environment minister huw irranca-davies .
" we need to understand much more about the scale and nature of the effect co2 is having on our oceans and marine life . "
scientists say ocean acidity has increased 30 % since the industrial revolution , the fastest change in ocean chemistry for at least 65 million years .
researchers warn that it could result in a massive extinction of life in the seas .
creatures that form alkaline shells are likely to be particularly affected and coral reefs may begin to crumble before the end of the century .
the problem has only recently hit the headlines , so research is still in its infancy .
us scientists are among the leaders in this new field , and the obama administration says it is very concerned about acidification .
the nation 's congress has also recently approved funds for a major research programme .

researchers say seas are becoming more acidic as a result of co2 from human activities being absorbed by seawater , which alters the oceans ' chemistry .
ministers say acidification of the oceans will be one of the major environmental concerns of this century .
the study will focus on the atlantic , antarctic and arctic oceans and assess how marine ecosystems are affected .

the venezuelan foreign ministry said peru 's decision to grant manuel rosales asylum constituted a " mockery of international law " .
mr rosales ran against mr chavez in venezuela 's 2006 presidential election .
he faces corruption charges which he says are baseless and went into hiding when the charges were filed last month .
venezuela 's foreign ministry said in a statement that peru should have detained and extradited mr rosales .
the ministry said venezuela was evaluating its diplomatic relations with peru .
' offence ' earlier , peruvian foreign minister jose garcia belaunde announced that asylum had been granted to mr rosales , who arrived in lima a week ago .
the decision was part of peru 's long-standing commitment to international law , he said .
the venezuelan foreign ministry , however , called peru 's move a " mockery of international law , a strong blow to the fight against corruption and an offence to the people of venezuela " .
peruvian president alan garcia is a washington ally and has clashed with mr chavez - a fierce critic of the us - in the past .
last year mr rosales was elected mayor of venezuela 's second biggest city , maracaibo .
he is facing multi-million-dollar corruption charges relating to a previous term as governor of zulia state .
mr rosales and his supporters say he is the victim of a political witch-hunt government supporters accuse him of taking part in a short-lived coup against mr chavez in april 2002 .
mr rosales has insisted that it was an honest mistake made in the confusion that followed the announcement of the president 's resignation .
