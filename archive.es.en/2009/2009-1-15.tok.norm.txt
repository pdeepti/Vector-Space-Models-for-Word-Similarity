dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .
15 .
" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .
15 .
" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .
" that being said , we are never pre-committed . " recession threatening most eurozone countries lower interest rates make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow money , something which governments are banking on to spur growth and cushion the impact of a deepening recession . after the rate cut , the euro slumped to 1.3085 dollars , its lowest in a month , as the common currency became less attractive to investors . recent economic data has shown that a number of countries in the 16-member eurozone are already in recession , with others facing a severe economic downturn .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 . " the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below , but close to two percent , " trichet said .
" we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead . " dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .

" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .

in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 .

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .

i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .

but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .

no country can sit back and wait it out .
with a series of economic stimulus packages , nations hope they can weather the storm . at their summit in december , the eu countries ' heads of state agreed to launch economic stimulus packages worth 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 263 billion -rrb- .
the eu commission 's central coffers in brussels will cover 30 billion euros .
but the eu 's 27 member states have to bring together the remaining 170 billion euros .
it 's up to the individual countries to determine which programs will be launched by how much in order to counteract the recession .
germany serves as europe 's engine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's economic locomotive after months of hesitation , the german government passed its second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros earlier this week .
it puts germany in the number one spot of such action .
together with its initial package from december , the german contribution is now 81 billion euros .
it is by far the largest package .
according to brussels , rightly so .
germany is the largest economy in the eu , after all , and must act as an engine for other nations .
france and britain pump funds france , which had initially criticized germany for holding things up , has introduced a stimulus package worth 26 billion euros .
these funds will mainly go towards the automobile and construction sectors and ensure some 100,000 jobs .
fraench president nicolas sarkozy is considering a second package and has acknowledged that german chancellor angela merkel reacted quicker than the french with a second package .
britain wants to pump 23.7 billion euros into the shrinking economy .
a reduced vat sales tax is in effect until the end of the year so that people consume more .
but experts doubt whether this stimulus for private demand is sufficient to boost the economy .
italy and spain take action italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said his economic stimulus package totaled 80 billion euros .
but according to expert opinions , berlusconi mainly added up measures previously agreed on , as well as older ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say berlusconi has added the numbers up differently new money for the package totaled just six billion euros .
it is being given to consumers in the form of consumption checks and discounts for energy costs .
spain passed an economic recovery plan worth 11 billion euros at the end of november .
it is supposed to support public investments in the construction industry .
the government already last summer put together a first stimulus package worth 38 billion euros , which consisted of tax breaks .
the spanish government had to take action before other european governments because the economic crisis already began shaking its economy at the beginning of last year .
larger nations employ larger packages the smaller eu countries have put together smaller packages according to their economic output .
austria prefers a tax reform to relieve its citizens and companies by three billion euros .
hungary , which has been hard hit by the economic crisis , is using 5.2 billion euros to support small businesses .
sweden decided on a stimulus package worth 2.4 billion euros .
belgium wants to pump two billion euros into its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people in lithuania are particularly hard hit by the crisis particularly those countries , which expect a shrinking economy this year , are putting together the largest rescue packages .
this group includes britain , ireland , spain , estonia , france , italy and germany .
according to eu commission estimates , lithuania will be hit hardest by the economic crisis .
the economy is expected to shrink by almost three percent there .
for slovakia , bulgaria , romania and poland , the eu expects weakened growth , but no recession .
economic stimulus packages are therefore more moderate in those countries .
romania has announced a stimulus package of 2.5 billion euros for 2009 , which the head of the romanian central bank feels actually is n't even necessary .
packages threaten stability pact most eu countries will be financing their economic stimulus packages through new national debt .
this will put the euro stability pact , which stipulates that member states must avoid excessive government deficits , to a tough test .
germany will violate the limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- slightly this year and significantly in 2010 .
france , italy , spain , ireland and greece will no doubt significantly breach the pact 's criteria .
in greece , the deficit could climb to as much as seven percent .
only the netherlands , sweden and finland are likely to maintain budgetary discipline . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .

" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy .

but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .

in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 .

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .

" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy .

but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .

in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 .

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .
15 .
" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .
" that being said , we are never pre-committed . " recession threatening most eurozone countries lower interest rates make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow money , something which governments are banking on to spur growth and cushion the impact of a deepening recession . after the rate cut , the euro slumped to 1.3085 dollars , its lowest in a month , as the common currency became less attractive to investors . recent economic data has shown that a number of countries in the 16-member eurozone are already in recession , with others facing a severe economic downturn .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 . " the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below , but close to two percent , " trichet said .

it plans to open 75 new us stores this year . up to now , german deep-discount retail chain aldi has had limited success in the united states .
its formula of selling a limited selection of no-name products at fire sale prices has made it a roaring success in europe , but across the ocean it has only managed to attract low-end shoppers .
now , however , the company is hoping to use the us economic crisis to its advantage , and aims to compete with heavy-hitting us discounter wal mart .
it has plans to open 75 new stores this year alone , including its first new york branch .
taking on wal-mart at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart failed to succeed in the german market aldi 's plans include expansion in oklahoma and texas - up to now , wal-mart country .
the chain will open a $ 40-million -lrb- 30.3-million-euro -rrb- distribution center in dallas .
to date , brand-conscious us shoppers have been a hard sell for aldi , where the shelves are mostly stocked with no-name wares .
but a report in the wall street journal earlier this week explained that the german discounter believes the current economic conditions in the us could make the market ripe for change .
the economic crisis creates " the perfect combination of factors " for success for the discounter , aldi 's us chief jason hart told the paper .
aiming for a higher class of customer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , an aldi will brighten new york 's skyline since 1976 , aldi has opened 1,000 branch stores in the usa - many in poorer neighborhoods .
now , aldi is aiming to grab a larger share of the middle-class market by building large windows and extra floor space in its stores in order to attract upscale shoppers .
the wall street journal described the typical aldi branch in the us as being short on space , with spartan product offerings .
wal-mart tried to make an incursion into germany in 1998 . but it pulled out in 2006 amid poor press over its employment practices , and also due to the fact that german shoppers - used to the dirt-cheap wares at aldi , among other discounters - found it too expensive .
in the us , though , aldi is still far from posing a serious threat to wal-mart .
the wall street journal cited market analyst planet retail , which said aldi 's us turnover for 2008 was $ 7 billion , compared with $ 374.5 billion for wal-mart . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no country can sit back and wait it out .
with a series of economic stimulus packages , nations hope they can weather the storm . at their summit in december , the eu countries ' heads of state agreed to launch economic stimulus packages worth 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 263 billion -rrb- .
the eu commission 's central coffers in brussels will cover 30 billion euros .
but the eu 's 27 member states have to bring together the remaining 170 billion euros .
it 's up to the individual countries to determine which programs will be launched by how much in order to counteract the recession .
germany serves as europe 's engine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's economic locomotive after months of hesitation , the german government passed its second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros earlier this week .
it puts germany in the number one spot of such action .
together with its initial package from december , the german contribution is now 81 billion euros .
it is by far the largest package .
according to brussels , rightly so .
germany is the largest economy in the eu , after all , and must act as an engine for other nations .
france and britain pump funds france , which had initially criticized germany for holding things up , has introduced a stimulus package worth 26 billion euros .
these funds will mainly go towards the automobile and construction sectors and ensure some 100,000 jobs .
fraench president nicolas sarkozy is considering a second package and has acknowledged that german chancellor angela merkel reacted quicker than the french with a second package .
britain wants to pump 23.7 billion euros into the shrinking economy .
a reduced vat sales tax is in effect until the end of the year so that people consume more .
but experts doubt whether this stimulus for private demand is sufficient to boost the economy .
italy and spain take action italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said his economic stimulus package totaled 80 billion euros .
but according to expert opinions , berlusconi mainly added up measures previously agreed on , as well as older ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say berlusconi has added the numbers up differently new money for the package totaled just six billion euros .
it is being given to consumers in the form of consumption checks and discounts for energy costs .
spain passed an economic recovery plan worth 11 billion euros at the end of november .
it is supposed to support public investments in the construction industry .
the government already last summer put together a first stimulus package worth 38 billion euros , which consisted of tax breaks .
the spanish government had to take action before other european governments because the economic crisis already began shaking its economy at the beginning of last year .
larger nations employ larger packages the smaller eu countries have put together smaller packages according to their economic output .
austria prefers a tax reform to relieve its citizens and companies by three billion euros .
hungary , which has been hard hit by the economic crisis , is using 5.2 billion euros to support small businesses .
sweden decided on a stimulus package worth 2.4 billion euros .
belgium wants to pump two billion euros into its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people in lithuania are particularly hard hit by the crisis particularly those countries , which expect a shrinking economy this year , are putting together the largest rescue packages .
this group includes britain , ireland , spain , estonia , france , italy and germany .
according to eu commission estimates , lithuania will be hit hardest by the economic crisis .
the economy is expected to shrink by almost three percent there .
for slovakia , bulgaria , romania and poland , the eu expects weakened growth , but no recession .
economic stimulus packages are therefore more moderate in those countries .
romania has announced a stimulus package of 2.5 billion euros for 2009 , which the head of the romanian central bank feels actually is n't even necessary .
packages threaten stability pact most eu countries will be financing their economic stimulus packages through new national debt .
this will put the euro stability pact , which stipulates that member states must avoid excessive government deficits , to a tough test .
germany will violate the limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- slightly this year and significantly in 2010 .
france , italy , spain , ireland and greece will no doubt significantly breach the pact 's criteria .
in greece , the deficit could climb to as much as seven percent .
only the netherlands , sweden and finland are likely to maintain budgetary discipline . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it plans to open 75 new us stores this year . up to now , german deep-discount retail chain aldi has had limited success in the united states .
its formula of selling a limited selection of no-name products at fire sale prices has made it a roaring success in europe , but across the ocean it has only managed to attract low-end shoppers .
now , however , the company is hoping to use the us economic crisis to its advantage , and aims to compete with heavy-hitting us discounter wal mart .
it has plans to open 75 new stores this year alone , including its first new york branch .
taking on wal-mart at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart failed to succeed in the german market aldi 's plans include expansion in oklahoma and texas - up to now , wal-mart country .
the chain will open a $ 40-million -lrb- 30.3-million-euro -rrb- distribution center in dallas .
to date , brand-conscious us shoppers have been a hard sell for aldi , where the shelves are mostly stocked with no-name wares .
but a report in the wall street journal earlier this week explained that the german discounter believes the current economic conditions in the us could make the market ripe for change .
the economic crisis creates " the perfect combination of factors " for success for the discounter , aldi 's us chief jason hart told the paper .
aiming for a higher class of customer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , an aldi will brighten new york 's skyline since 1976 , aldi has opened 1,000 branch stores in the usa - many in poorer neighborhoods .
now , aldi is aiming to grab a larger share of the middle-class market by building large windows and extra floor space in its stores in order to attract upscale shoppers .
the wall street journal described the typical aldi branch in the us as being short on space , with spartan product offerings .
wal-mart tried to make an incursion into germany in 1998 . but it pulled out in 2006 amid poor press over its employment practices , and also due to the fact that german shoppers - used to the dirt-cheap wares at aldi , among other discounters - found it too expensive .
in the us , though , aldi is still far from posing a serious threat to wal-mart .
the wall street journal cited market analyst planet retail , which said aldi 's us turnover for 2008 was $ 7 billion , compared with $ 374.5 billion for wal-mart . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no country can sit back and wait it out .
with a series of economic stimulus packages , nations hope they can weather the storm . at their summit in december , the eu countries ' heads of state agreed to launch economic stimulus packages worth 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 263 billion -rrb- .
the eu commission 's central coffers in brussels will cover 30 billion euros .
but the eu 's 27 member states have to bring together the remaining 170 billion euros .
it 's up to the individual countries to determine which programs will be launched by how much in order to counteract the recession .
germany serves as europe 's engine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's economic locomotive after months of hesitation , the german government passed its second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros earlier this week .
it puts germany in the number one spot of such action .
together with its initial package from december , the german contribution is now 81 billion euros .
it is by far the largest package .
according to brussels , rightly so .
germany is the largest economy in the eu , after all , and must act as an engine for other nations .
france and britain pump funds france , which had initially criticized germany for holding things up , has introduced a stimulus package worth 26 billion euros .
these funds will mainly go towards the automobile and construction sectors and ensure some 100,000 jobs .
fraench president nicolas sarkozy is considering a second package and has acknowledged that german chancellor angela merkel reacted quicker than the french with a second package .
britain wants to pump 23.7 billion euros into the shrinking economy .
a reduced vat sales tax is in effect until the end of the year so that people consume more .
but experts doubt whether this stimulus for private demand is sufficient to boost the economy .
italy and spain take action italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said his economic stimulus package totaled 80 billion euros .
but according to expert opinions , berlusconi mainly added up measures previously agreed on , as well as older ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say berlusconi has added the numbers up differently new money for the package totaled just six billion euros .
it is being given to consumers in the form of consumption checks and discounts for energy costs .
spain passed an economic recovery plan worth 11 billion euros at the end of november .
it is supposed to support public investments in the construction industry .
the government already last summer put together a first stimulus package worth 38 billion euros , which consisted of tax breaks .
the spanish government had to take action before other european governments because the economic crisis already began shaking its economy at the beginning of last year .
larger nations employ larger packages the smaller eu countries have put together smaller packages according to their economic output .
austria prefers a tax reform to relieve its citizens and companies by three billion euros .
hungary , which has been hard hit by the economic crisis , is using 5.2 billion euros to support small businesses .
sweden decided on a stimulus package worth 2.4 billion euros .
belgium wants to pump two billion euros into its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people in lithuania are particularly hard hit by the crisis particularly those countries , which expect a shrinking economy this year , are putting together the largest rescue packages .
this group includes britain , ireland , spain , estonia , france , italy and germany .
according to eu commission estimates , lithuania will be hit hardest by the economic crisis .
the economy is expected to shrink by almost three percent there .
for slovakia , bulgaria , romania and poland , the eu expects weakened growth , but no recession .
economic stimulus packages are therefore more moderate in those countries .
romania has announced a stimulus package of 2.5 billion euros for 2009 , which the head of the romanian central bank feels actually is n't even necessary .
packages threaten stability pact most eu countries will be financing their economic stimulus packages through new national debt .
this will put the euro stability pact , which stipulates that member states must avoid excessive government deficits , to a tough test .
germany will violate the limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- slightly this year and significantly in 2010 .
france , italy , spain , ireland and greece will no doubt significantly breach the pact 's criteria .
in greece , the deficit could climb to as much as seven percent .
only the netherlands , sweden and finland are likely to maintain budgetary discipline . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.01.2009 avi primor : eu essential for guaranteeing israeli security in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's offensive against hamas in the gaza strip has killed more than 1,000 people dw-world.de spoke to israel 's former ambassador to germany , avi primor , about the reasons for the israeli offensive in the gaza strip and how the eu can help bring about peace between the jews and palestinians . avi primor , who was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 , is head of the center for european studies in herzliya .
dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .

the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.01.2009 avi primor : eu essential for guaranteeing israeli security in gaza großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's offensive against hamas in the gaza strip has killed more than 1,000 people dw-world.de spoke to israel 's former ambassador to germany , avi primor , about the reasons for the israeli offensive in the gaza strip and how the eu can help bring about peace between the jews and palestinians . avi primor , who was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 , is head of the center for european studies in herzliya .
dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .
15 .
" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .
" that being said , we are never pre-committed . " recession threatening most eurozone countries lower interest rates make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow money , something which governments are banking on to spur growth and cushion the impact of a deepening recession . after the rate cut , the euro slumped to 1.3085 dollars , its lowest in a month , as the common currency became less attractive to investors . recent economic data has shown that a number of countries in the 16-member eurozone are already in recession , with others facing a severe economic downturn .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 . " the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below , but close to two percent , " trichet said .
" we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead . " dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it plans to open 75 new us stores this year . up to now , german deep-discount retail chain aldi has had limited success in the united states .
its formula of selling a limited selection of no-name products at fire sale prices has made it a roaring success in europe , but across the ocean it has only managed to attract low-end shoppers .
now , however , the company is hoping to use the us economic crisis to its advantage , and aims to compete with heavy-hitting us discounter wal mart .
it has plans to open 75 new stores this year alone , including its first new york branch .
taking on wal-mart at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart failed to succeed in the german market aldi 's plans include expansion in oklahoma and texas - up to now , wal-mart country .
the chain will open a $ 40-million -lrb- 30.3-million-euro -rrb- distribution center in dallas .
to date , brand-conscious us shoppers have been a hard sell for aldi , where the shelves are mostly stocked with no-name wares .
but a report in the wall street journal earlier this week explained that the german discounter believes the current economic conditions in the us could make the market ripe for change .
the economic crisis creates " the perfect combination of factors " for success for the discounter , aldi 's us chief jason hart told the paper .
aiming for a higher class of customer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , an aldi will brighten new york 's skyline since 1976 , aldi has opened 1,000 branch stores in the usa - many in poorer neighborhoods .
now , aldi is aiming to grab a larger share of the middle-class market by building large windows and extra floor space in its stores in order to attract upscale shoppers .
the wall street journal described the typical aldi branch in the us as being short on space , with spartan product offerings .
wal-mart tried to make an incursion into germany in 1998 . but it pulled out in 2006 amid poor press over its employment practices , and also due to the fact that german shoppers - used to the dirt-cheap wares at aldi , among other discounters - found it too expensive .

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .
15 .
" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .
" that being said , we are never pre-committed . " recession threatening most eurozone countries lower interest rates make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow money , something which governments are banking on to spur growth and cushion the impact of a deepening recession . after the rate cut , the euro slumped to 1.3085 dollars , its lowest in a month , as the common currency became less attractive to investors . recent economic data has shown that a number of countries in the 16-member eurozone are already in recession , with others facing a severe economic downturn .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 . " the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below , but close to two percent , " trichet said .
" we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead . " dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .
15 .
" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .
" that being said , we are never pre-committed . " recession threatening most eurozone countries lower interest rates make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow money , something which governments are banking on to spur growth and cushion the impact of a deepening recession . after the rate cut , the euro slumped to 1.3085 dollars , its lowest in a month , as the common currency became less attractive to investors . recent economic data has shown that a number of countries in the 16-member eurozone are already in recession , with others facing a severe economic downturn .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 . " the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below , but close to two percent , " trichet said .

aiming for a higher class of customer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , an aldi will brighten new york 's skyline since 1976 , aldi has opened 1,000 branch stores in the usa - many in poorer neighborhoods .
now , aldi is aiming to grab a larger share of the middle-class market by building large windows and extra floor space in its stores in order to attract upscale shoppers .
the wall street journal described the typical aldi branch in the us as being short on space , with spartan product offerings .
wal-mart tried to make an incursion into germany in 1998 . but it pulled out in 2006 amid poor press over its employment practices , and also due to the fact that german shoppers - used to the dirt-cheap wares at aldi , among other discounters - found it too expensive .
in the us , though , aldi is still far from posing a serious threat to wal-mart .
the wall street journal cited market analyst planet retail , which said aldi 's us turnover for 2008 was $ 7 billion , compared with $ 374.5 billion for wal-mart . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no country can sit back and wait it out .
with a series of economic stimulus packages , nations hope they can weather the storm . at their summit in december , the eu countries ' heads of state agreed to launch economic stimulus packages worth 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 263 billion -rrb- .
the eu commission 's central coffers in brussels will cover 30 billion euros .
but the eu 's 27 member states have to bring together the remaining 170 billion euros .
it 's up to the individual countries to determine which programs will be launched by how much in order to counteract the recession .
germany serves as europe 's engine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's economic locomotive after months of hesitation , the german government passed its second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros earlier this week .
it puts germany in the number one spot of such action .
together with its initial package from december , the german contribution is now 81 billion euros .
it is by far the largest package .
according to brussels , rightly so .
germany is the largest economy in the eu , after all , and must act as an engine for other nations .
france and britain pump funds france , which had initially criticized germany for holding things up , has introduced a stimulus package worth 26 billion euros .
these funds will mainly go towards the automobile and construction sectors and ensure some 100,000 jobs .
fraench president nicolas sarkozy is considering a second package and has acknowledged that german chancellor angela merkel reacted quicker than the french with a second package .
britain wants to pump 23.7 billion euros into the shrinking economy .
a reduced vat sales tax is in effect until the end of the year so that people consume more .
but experts doubt whether this stimulus for private demand is sufficient to boost the economy .
italy and spain take action italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said his economic stimulus package totaled 80 billion euros .
but according to expert opinions , berlusconi mainly added up measures previously agreed on , as well as older ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say berlusconi has added the numbers up differently new money for the package totaled just six billion euros .
it is being given to consumers in the form of consumption checks and discounts for energy costs .
spain passed an economic recovery plan worth 11 billion euros at the end of november .
it is supposed to support public investments in the construction industry .
the government already last summer put together a first stimulus package worth 38 billion euros , which consisted of tax breaks .
the spanish government had to take action before other european governments because the economic crisis already began shaking its economy at the beginning of last year .
larger nations employ larger packages the smaller eu countries have put together smaller packages according to their economic output .
austria prefers a tax reform to relieve its citizens and companies by three billion euros .
hungary , which has been hard hit by the economic crisis , is using 5.2 billion euros to support small businesses .
sweden decided on a stimulus package worth 2.4 billion euros .
belgium wants to pump two billion euros into its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people in lithuania are particularly hard hit by the crisis particularly those countries , which expect a shrinking economy this year , are putting together the largest rescue packages .
this group includes britain , ireland , spain , estonia , france , italy and germany .
according to eu commission estimates , lithuania will be hit hardest by the economic crisis .
the economy is expected to shrink by almost three percent there .
for slovakia , bulgaria , romania and poland , the eu expects weakened growth , but no recession .
economic stimulus packages are therefore more moderate in those countries .
romania has announced a stimulus package of 2.5 billion euros for 2009 , which the head of the romanian central bank feels actually is n't even necessary .
packages threaten stability pact most eu countries will be financing their economic stimulus packages through new national debt .
this will put the euro stability pact , which stipulates that member states must avoid excessive government deficits , to a tough test .
germany will violate the limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- slightly this year and significantly in 2010 .
france , italy , spain , ireland and greece will no doubt significantly breach the pact 's criteria .
in greece , the deficit could climb to as much as seven percent .
only the netherlands , sweden and finland are likely to maintain budgetary discipline . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy .

but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .

the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 .

with a series of economic stimulus packages , nations hope they can weather the storm . at their summit in december , the eu countries ' heads of state agreed to launch economic stimulus packages worth 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 263 billion -rrb- .
the eu commission 's central coffers in brussels will cover 30 billion euros .
but the eu 's 27 member states have to bring together the remaining 170 billion euros .
it 's up to the individual countries to determine which programs will be launched by how much in order to counteract the recession .
germany serves as europe 's engine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's economic locomotive after months of hesitation , the german government passed its second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros earlier this week .
it puts germany in the number one spot of such action .
together with its initial package from december , the german contribution is now 81 billion euros .
it is by far the largest package .
according to brussels , rightly so .
germany is the largest economy in the eu , after all , and must act as an engine for other nations .
france and britain pump funds france , which had initially criticized germany for holding things up , has introduced a stimulus package worth 26 billion euros .
these funds will mainly go towards the automobile and construction sectors and ensure some 100,000 jobs .
fraench president nicolas sarkozy is considering a second package and has acknowledged that german chancellor angela merkel reacted quicker than the french with a second package .
britain wants to pump 23.7 billion euros into the shrinking economy .
a reduced vat sales tax is in effect until the end of the year so that people consume more .
but experts doubt whether this stimulus for private demand is sufficient to boost the economy .
italy and spain take action italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said his economic stimulus package totaled 80 billion euros .
but according to expert opinions , berlusconi mainly added up measures previously agreed on , as well as older ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say berlusconi has added the numbers up differently new money for the package totaled just six billion euros .
it is being given to consumers in the form of consumption checks and discounts for energy costs .
spain passed an economic recovery plan worth 11 billion euros at the end of november .
it is supposed to support public investments in the construction industry .
the government already last summer put together a first stimulus package worth 38 billion euros , which consisted of tax breaks .
the spanish government had to take action before other european governments because the economic crisis already began shaking its economy at the beginning of last year .
larger nations employ larger packages the smaller eu countries have put together smaller packages according to their economic output .
austria prefers a tax reform to relieve its citizens and companies by three billion euros .
hungary , which has been hard hit by the economic crisis , is using 5.2 billion euros to support small businesses .

this group includes britain , ireland , spain , estonia , france , italy and germany .
according to eu commission estimates , lithuania will be hit hardest by the economic crisis .
the economy is expected to shrink by almost three percent there .
for slovakia , bulgaria , romania and poland , the eu expects weakened growth , but no recession .
economic stimulus packages are therefore more moderate in those countries .
romania has announced a stimulus package of 2.5 billion euros for 2009 , which the head of the romanian central bank feels actually is n't even necessary .
packages threaten stability pact most eu countries will be financing their economic stimulus packages through new national debt .
this will put the euro stability pact , which stipulates that member states must avoid excessive government deficits , to a tough test .
germany will violate the limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- slightly this year and significantly in 2010 .
france , italy , spain , ireland and greece will no doubt significantly breach the pact 's criteria .
in greece , the deficit could climb to as much as seven percent .

it plans to open 75 new us stores this year . up to now , german deep-discount retail chain aldi has had limited success in the united states .
its formula of selling a limited selection of no-name products at fire sale prices has made it a roaring success in europe , but across the ocean it has only managed to attract low-end shoppers .
now , however , the company is hoping to use the us economic crisis to its advantage , and aims to compete with heavy-hitting us discounter wal mart .
it has plans to open 75 new stores this year alone , including its first new york branch .
taking on wal-mart at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart failed to succeed in the german market aldi 's plans include expansion in oklahoma and texas - up to now , wal-mart country .
the chain will open a $ 40-million -lrb- 30.3-million-euro -rrb- distribution center in dallas .
to date , brand-conscious us shoppers have been a hard sell for aldi , where the shelves are mostly stocked with no-name wares .
but a report in the wall street journal earlier this week explained that the german discounter believes the current economic conditions in the us could make the market ripe for change .
the economic crisis creates " the perfect combination of factors " for success for the discounter , aldi 's us chief jason hart told the paper .
aiming for a higher class of customer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , an aldi will brighten new york 's skyline since 1976 , aldi has opened 1,000 branch stores in the usa - many in poorer neighborhoods .
now , aldi is aiming to grab a larger share of the middle-class market by building large windows and extra floor space in its stores in order to attract upscale shoppers .
the wall street journal described the typical aldi branch in the us as being short on space , with spartan product offerings .
wal-mart tried to make an incursion into germany in 1998 . but it pulled out in 2006 amid poor press over its employment practices , and also due to the fact that german shoppers - used to the dirt-cheap wares at aldi , among other discounters - found it too expensive .
in the us , though , aldi is still far from posing a serious threat to wal-mart .
the wall street journal cited market analyst planet retail , which said aldi 's us turnover for 2008 was $ 7 billion , compared with $ 374.5 billion for wal-mart . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .
15 .
" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy . " there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing " a significant slowdown , " trichet said , adding that financial market turmoil is keeping the level of uncertainty exceptionally high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the latest data showed a further weakening of economic activity it was the fourth time since october that the bank had cut rates , including a reduction of borrowing costs by 75 basis points in december , the biggest in its 10-year history .
but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .
" that being said , we are never pre-committed . " recession threatening most eurozone countries lower interest rates make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow money , something which governments are banking on to spur growth and cushion the impact of a deepening recession . after the rate cut , the euro slumped to 1.3085 dollars , its lowest in a month , as the common currency became less attractive to investors . recent economic data has shown that a number of countries in the 16-member eurozone are already in recession , with others facing a severe economic downturn .
in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 . " the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below , but close to two percent , " trichet said .
" we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead . " dpa news agency -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it plans to open 75 new us stores this year . up to now , german deep-discount retail chain aldi has had limited success in the united states .
its formula of selling a limited selection of no-name products at fire sale prices has made it a roaring success in europe , but across the ocean it has only managed to attract low-end shoppers .
now , however , the company is hoping to use the us economic crisis to its advantage , and aims to compete with heavy-hitting us discounter wal mart .
it has plans to open 75 new stores this year alone , including its first new york branch .
taking on wal-mart at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart failed to succeed in the german market aldi 's plans include expansion in oklahoma and texas - up to now , wal-mart country .
the chain will open a $ 40-million -lrb- 30.3-million-euro -rrb- distribution center in dallas .
to date , brand-conscious us shoppers have been a hard sell for aldi , where the shelves are mostly stocked with no-name wares .
but a report in the wall street journal earlier this week explained that the german discounter believes the current economic conditions in the us could make the market ripe for change .
the economic crisis creates " the perfect combination of factors " for success for the discounter , aldi 's us chief jason hart told the paper .
aiming for a higher class of customer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , an aldi will brighten new york 's skyline since 1976 , aldi has opened 1,000 branch stores in the usa - many in poorer neighborhoods .
now , aldi is aiming to grab a larger share of the middle-class market by building large windows and extra floor space in its stores in order to attract upscale shoppers .
the wall street journal described the typical aldi branch in the us as being short on space , with spartan product offerings .
wal-mart tried to make an incursion into germany in 1998 . but it pulled out in 2006 amid poor press over its employment practices , and also due to the fact that german shoppers - used to the dirt-cheap wares at aldi , among other discounters - found it too expensive .
in the us , though , aldi is still far from posing a serious threat to wal-mart .
the wall street journal cited market analyst planet retail , which said aldi 's us turnover for 2008 was $ 7 billion , compared with $ 374.5 billion for wal-mart . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it plans to open 75 new us stores this year . up to now , german deep-discount retail chain aldi has had limited success in the united states .
its formula of selling a limited selection of no-name products at fire sale prices has made it a roaring success in europe , but across the ocean it has only managed to attract low-end shoppers .
now , however , the company is hoping to use the us economic crisis to its advantage , and aims to compete with heavy-hitting us discounter wal mart .
it has plans to open 75 new stores this year alone , including its first new york branch .
taking on wal-mart at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart failed to succeed in the german market aldi 's plans include expansion in oklahoma and texas - up to now , wal-mart country .
the chain will open a $ 40-million -lrb- 30.3-million-euro -rrb- distribution center in dallas .
to date , brand-conscious us shoppers have been a hard sell for aldi , where the shelves are mostly stocked with no-name wares .
but a report in the wall street journal earlier this week explained that the german discounter believes the current economic conditions in the us could make the market ripe for change .
the economic crisis creates " the perfect combination of factors " for success for the discounter , aldi 's us chief jason hart told the paper .
aiming for a higher class of customer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , an aldi will brighten new york 's skyline since 1976 , aldi has opened 1,000 branch stores in the usa - many in poorer neighborhoods .
now , aldi is aiming to grab a larger share of the middle-class market by building large windows and extra floor space in its stores in order to attract upscale shoppers .
the wall street journal described the typical aldi branch in the us as being short on space , with spartan product offerings .
wal-mart tried to make an incursion into germany in 1998 . but it pulled out in 2006 amid poor press over its employment practices , and also due to the fact that german shoppers - used to the dirt-cheap wares at aldi , among other discounters - found it too expensive .
in the us , though , aldi is still far from posing a serious threat to wal-mart .
the wall street journal cited market analyst planet retail , which said aldi 's us turnover for 2008 was $ 7 billion , compared with $ 374.5 billion for wal-mart . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not say it was now the limit and we would not move any more , " he said after a meeting of the bank 's governing council on thursday , jan .

" we said that we were anticipating future bad news -lrb- … -rrb- from the real economy .

but it still leaves the rate above that of the us federal reserve , which has cut borrowing costs to near zero , and the bank of england , whose main lending rate is at an historic low of 1.5 percent . " today 's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish , " said trichet , who forecast that inflation in the eurozone would continue to ease until mid-year .
trichet said he did not expect next month 's scheduled meeting of the ecb council to alter interest rates , because the date was only three weeks away . the next interest rate review would be in early march " where we will have substantial new information , " said trichet .

in germany , europe 's biggest economy , annual growth in 2008 slumped to 1.3 percent , nearly half of what it was the year before , as the economy contracted up to two percent in the final quarter . analysts predict the german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- could shrink between two to three percent this year , something which would have repercussions across europe . euro-area industrial production slumped for the seventh consecutive month in november , leaving it 7.7 percent below what it was a year earlier . consumer prices dip figures released by the european union 's statistics office , eurostat , showed seasonally adjustment unemployment in the euro region inching up to 7.8 percent in november . eurozone inflation plunged to its lowest level in more than two years in december , dropping to a lower-than-forecast 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in november .
the fall in inflation also took consumer prices comfortably below the ecb 's annual inflation target of close to , but below two percent for the first time since august 2007 .

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .
because when israel hits back with all its firepower , it 's not going to be in your favor " .
keep in mind : israel did n't react for a whole week , hoping to restore the ceasefire , but that did n't work .
in the meantime , the israelis living in those towns and villages that were bombarded , demanded that the government to do something .
our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our aim is not a re-conquest of the gaza strip , not even the destruction of hamas .
we just want to impose a viable ceasefire .
hamas argues that it terminated the ceasefire because israel did n't keep to its end of the deal by lifting the blockade that was a part of the agreement … israel lifted the blockade partially .
but every once in a while when we opened the gaza-israeli border and let trucks go by , hamas would shoot at the passengers .
why ?
because their real interest is to let the civilian population suffer .
then the bad blood the palestinians have against the israelis rises , so the population supports the one and only fighter against the israeli enemy , which is hamas .
besides when hamas speaks about the blockade they do n't mean just israel , but the border with egypt too .
the egyptians fear the fundamentalists even more than we do , so they 've closed their border with gaza .
we are not against lifting the blockade , but we want to be sure that once we do so , it will be for transporting civilian supplies and not for rearmament .
we will not allow the passage of iranian weapons assistance and possibly more modern rockets with greater firing range .
why do n't you just bomb the underground tunnels that transport weapons instead of resorting to air strikes at the civilian population then ?
our targets are the tunnels , the militants , the factories that produce arms , not the civilian population , but we can not avoid mistakes in war .
there are middle east experts who say that hamas is not all out to destroy israel even though that 's what their charter says .
it 's just rhetoric and that it is possible to engage hamas in reinforcing the ceasefire .
do you agree ?
i partially agree .
we 've already talked to hamas using egyptian mediation to evacuate jewish settlements in the gaza strip peacefully .
you can negotiate with hamas when there is a common interest involved .
my suggestion is to let the palestinian government in ramallah -lrb- led by the moderate president mahmoud abbas on the west bank -rrb- come to terms with the hamas government in the gaza strip to create a federation in which hamas would empower ramallah to negotiate with israel in the name of all palestinians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-state solution is the only solution , says primor are you suggesting a two-state solution ?
it 's the only solution .
we have to end all occupation and evacuate the west bank colonies , but we do n't want a repeat of gaza .
when we did evacuate the settlements and pull our troops out , what we got were rocket attacks .
so if we sign a peace agreement with the ramallah government and this is perfectly possible , then we need somebody who could guarantee the security of israel .
who would that be ? i see the europeans doing that .
the eu would not just be helpful , but essential .
i do n't see the americans doing that .
why not ?
the vast majority of american public opinion supports israel blindly and has a hatred of palestinians , who are viewed as part of world arab fanaticism .
but there 's a new us administration coming in next week … maybe , but public opinion wo n't change .
what could happen is that -lrb- president-elect barack -rrb- obama would actively support a european initiative .
the eu needs to give israel security guarantees after the pull out of israeli occupational forces from the west bank .
that means the europeans should send in an international army to replace the israelis and impose a security force in cooperation with the palestinians .
that does not mean the troops all have to be european .
i would recommend turkish troops , who are muslim and others too .
it is essential to have first and foremost the political will , then the financial support behind such a mission . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : the numbers speak for themselves in gaza .
over 1,000 casualties on the palestinian side : civilians and children killed or maimed by israeli fire , whereas hamas ' hand-made rockets have killed only a handful of soldiers in israel .
this lopsided war is damaging to israel 's international reputation and drawing bad blood among young palestinians .
why has israel 's response been so " disproportionate " ?
avi primor : i agree with your assumptions , but we did n't have a choice .
we 're trying to fight a terrorist organization , which claims its aim is to destroy the state of israel .
we had a ceasefire agreement last year and on the 19th of december , hamas unilaterally declared the end of it and started bombarding our towns with as many as 80 rockets a day .
look at it like this : you live in a town in which an alarm goes off every five minutes , you keep hearing rockets exploding and you ca n't have a normal life .
even if you are not directly hit , you live in fear and you do n't see any reason to be fired at .
i agree that the casualties are far higher on the palestinian side , but that is because hamas first of all , hides behind the civilian population , using people as a human shield .
secondly , our fire power is much stronger than theirs .
in war , you use all the means at your disposal to enforce a ceasefire .
it 's a horrible tragedy , but this is not a circus game in which you have to use the same amount of power as the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avi primor and hamas knows all that .
the egyptians kept telling them , " we told you to stop provoking israel .

no country can sit back and wait it out .
with a series of economic stimulus packages , nations hope they can weather the storm . at their summit in december , the eu countries ' heads of state agreed to launch economic stimulus packages worth 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 263 billion -rrb- .
the eu commission 's central coffers in brussels will cover 30 billion euros .
but the eu 's 27 member states have to bring together the remaining 170 billion euros .
it 's up to the individual countries to determine which programs will be launched by how much in order to counteract the recession .
germany serves as europe 's engine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's economic locomotive after months of hesitation , the german government passed its second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros earlier this week .
it puts germany in the number one spot of such action .
together with its initial package from december , the german contribution is now 81 billion euros .
it is by far the largest package .
according to brussels , rightly so .
germany is the largest economy in the eu , after all , and must act as an engine for other nations .
france and britain pump funds france , which had initially criticized germany for holding things up , has introduced a stimulus package worth 26 billion euros .
these funds will mainly go towards the automobile and construction sectors and ensure some 100,000 jobs .
fraench president nicolas sarkozy is considering a second package and has acknowledged that german chancellor angela merkel reacted quicker than the french with a second package .
britain wants to pump 23.7 billion euros into the shrinking economy .
a reduced vat sales tax is in effect until the end of the year so that people consume more .
but experts doubt whether this stimulus for private demand is sufficient to boost the economy .
italy and spain take action italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said his economic stimulus package totaled 80 billion euros .
but according to expert opinions , berlusconi mainly added up measures previously agreed on , as well as older ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say berlusconi has added the numbers up differently new money for the package totaled just six billion euros .
it is being given to consumers in the form of consumption checks and discounts for energy costs .
spain passed an economic recovery plan worth 11 billion euros at the end of november .
it is supposed to support public investments in the construction industry .
the government already last summer put together a first stimulus package worth 38 billion euros , which consisted of tax breaks .
the spanish government had to take action before other european governments because the economic crisis already began shaking its economy at the beginning of last year .
larger nations employ larger packages the smaller eu countries have put together smaller packages according to their economic output .
austria prefers a tax reform to relieve its citizens and companies by three billion euros .
hungary , which has been hard hit by the economic crisis , is using 5.2 billion euros to support small businesses .
sweden decided on a stimulus package worth 2.4 billion euros .
belgium wants to pump two billion euros into its economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people in lithuania are particularly hard hit by the crisis particularly those countries , which expect a shrinking economy this year , are putting together the largest rescue packages .
this group includes britain , ireland , spain , estonia , france , italy and germany .
according to eu commission estimates , lithuania will be hit hardest by the economic crisis .
the economy is expected to shrink by almost three percent there .
for slovakia , bulgaria , romania and poland , the eu expects weakened growth , but no recession .
economic stimulus packages are therefore more moderate in those countries .
romania has announced a stimulus package of 2.5 billion euros for 2009 , which the head of the romanian central bank feels actually is n't even necessary .
packages threaten stability pact most eu countries will be financing their economic stimulus packages through new national debt .
this will put the euro stability pact , which stipulates that member states must avoid excessive government deficits , to a tough test .
germany will violate the limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- slightly this year and significantly in 2010 .
france , italy , spain , ireland and greece will no doubt significantly breach the pact 's criteria .
in greece , the deficit could climb to as much as seven percent .
only the netherlands , sweden and finland are likely to maintain budgetary discipline . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington dc is abuzz with preparations for the inauguration i offer no excuse other than seasonal sloth and general exhaustion but the hammering of the wooden platform in front of the white house for the big day has wrenched me from my slumber and forced me to reboot my computer .
washington is of course scrubbing up for perhaps the most anticipated inauguration in history .
next week 's party has focused the minds and energies of this city like a village wedding in a time of pestilence .
rehearsals are being held , flags measured and brass instruments polished in defiance of the plunging dow and the abysmal job numbers .
the capital is slowly beginning to fill up .
booked solid washington dc , a city of just over one million inhabitants , may play host to a visiting crowd of three million .
trains have been booked solid for months .
you can not find a hotel room as far away as baltimore or richmond , and enterprising citizens of the district are pitching tents and renting their homes for astronomical sums .
for one week the recession - or is it now a depression ? - will be banished from this town like an evil spirit .
bars will stay open until 4am on the day after inauguration night .
barack obama has risen to the mounting challenge of crisis and expectation by flexing his muscles hollywood stars who normally shun the federal capital like a leper colony will descend en masse .
reagan airport will become a parking lot for executive jets .
and at one night club they have taken the obama worship to new levels by offering the " dream " cocktail , a sickly concoction of rum , caramel and cinnamon .
the economy continues to tank , gaza continues to burn and eastern europe continues to shiver without russian gas but the world , it seems , does not begrudge washington its festivities , just as the world wishes george bush a speedy transition to retirement amid the tumbleweed of texas .
desperate times call for an extreme make-over and the new president will have to walk a tightrope of managed anticipation and tempered optimism , without plunging into the abyss of despair .
i would not call the obama cocktail " the dream " - how about " the wake-up call " ? : two shots of vodka to numb the pain , a generous squeeze of lime and lemon to give a kick , and a dash of carrot juice to line the stomach .
renewal of vows i wonder what it must feel like to be barack obama as the clock ticks down to his first day on the new job .
today he can still issue uber-sized stimulus packages without having to take responsibility for them .
he has picked his team .
he has consulted the history books and no doubt drafted and redrafted the most important speech of his life , all the while staring up at the mount rushmore of expectations looming over him .
if this is daunting , he has - in part - only himself to blame .
barack obama has risen to the mounting challenge of crisis and expectation by flexing his muscles .
the spirit of abraham lincoln will be everywhere he is david on stilts armed with a bazooka , kicking sand into goliath 's face .
as david brooks put it in the new york times this week : " we will know by the end of the year whether he is a great president or the opposite . "
mr obama would probably respond that he is not a gambler by choice , but that the dice have been thrust into his hand by destiny .
this is not a time for timid men .
every inauguration is a renewal of the vows between american democracy and its chief custodian .
it is the bespoke coronation of a newly-elected -lrb- temporary -rrb- monarch ; a rebooting of the american dream .
recurring nightmare every successor to george washington must feel a hint of this .
even poor old president harrison who spoke for two hours without a hat in freezing temperatures on his big day in 1841 , contracted pneumonia and died a month later .
even lyndon johnson , who was promoted from vice president to president by an assassin 's bullet and took a hurried oath on air force one while waiting to depart from love field in dallas .
the newly widowed jackie kennedy stood by his side .
the body of the man he replaced travelled in a box in the hold below .
every presidential swearing-in , however bizarre or tragic , hums with history .
every living president follows in the footsteps of his predecessors cast in marble , iron or bronze all around him on washington 's imperial axis , the ceremonial mall .
i would not be surprised if one of the hazards of the job was a recurring nightmare about fdr coming to life and wheeling over to the new occupant to offer advice , jefferson striding over from his domed memorial to exude disdain and pity , ulysses grant stepping off his horse to berate or ronald reagan bestowing a smile and a wink .
all the accumulated poignancy of inauguration day will only be the beginning of what promises to be one of the most challenging presidencies of all time barack obama will no doubt be dreaming about all of them but he has cloaked his inauguration in the man who bookends the ceremony in so many ways .
the senator from illinois , who kicked off his candidacy in the old state capitol where abraham lincoln 's voice once echoed , will swear his oath on lincoln 's bible .
he will do so in front of the washington capitol 's dome , mr lincoln 's grandiose project designed to celebrate the rebirth of a union torn apart by civil war .
and he will look straight into the hooded eyes of the lugubrious 16th president sitting in his giant temple at the other end of the mall .
mr lincoln will be everywhere , closely followed by the spirit of martin luther king who used the steps in front of the memorial to declare that he had a dream .
with barack obama 's inauguration that dream has been fulfilled in ways that even dr king might not have dared to imagine .
but all the accumulated poignancy of inauguration day will only be the beginning of what promises to be one of the most challenging presidencies of all time .
barack obama clocks into his new job at a time of war , economic crisis and global flux .
well-worn certainties have been replaced by searing doubts .
we know from last week 's presidential lunch at 1600 pennsylvania avenue that all the living holders of the office already wish him well .
now he also needs every dead president on his side .

every living president follows in the footsteps of his predecessors cast in marble , iron or bronze all around him on washington 's imperial axis , the ceremonial mall .
i would not be surprised if one of the hazards of the job was a recurring nightmare about fdr coming to life and wheeling over to the new occupant to offer advice , jefferson striding over from his domed memorial to exude disdain and pity , ulysses grant stepping off his horse to berate or ronald reagan bestowing a smile and a wink .
all the accumulated poignancy of inauguration day will only be the beginning of what promises to be one of the most challenging presidencies of all time barack obama will no doubt be dreaming about all of them but he has cloaked his inauguration in the man who bookends the ceremony in so many ways .
the senator from illinois , who kicked off his candidacy in the old state capitol where abraham lincoln 's voice once echoed , will swear his oath on lincoln 's bible .
he will do so in front of the washington capitol 's dome , mr lincoln 's grandiose project designed to celebrate the rebirth of a union torn apart by civil war .
and he will look straight into the hooded eyes of the lugubrious 16th president sitting in his giant temple at the other end of the mall .
mr lincoln will be everywhere , closely followed by the spirit of martin luther king who used the steps in front of the memorial to declare that he had a dream .
with barack obama 's inauguration that dream has been fulfilled in ways that even dr king might not have dared to imagine .
but all the accumulated poignancy of inauguration day will only be the beginning of what promises to be one of the most challenging presidencies of all time .
barack obama clocks into his new job at a time of war , economic crisis and global flux .
well-worn certainties have been replaced by searing doubts .
we know from last week 's presidential lunch at 1600 pennsylvania avenue that all the living holders of the office already wish him well .
now he also needs every dead president on his side .

arthur boyd has written to 9,500 pms members , which went into administration in november , recommending " an orderly run down " of its business over time .
he said this would mean part of the members ' investments would be repaid .
mr boyd said if the proposals were rejected the pms would have to go into liquidation and members were likely to receive less this way .
his proposals , and voting papers , were posted so as to arrive with members by thursday .
more than 50 % have to back the plans , with a vote deadline of noon on 30 january , for them to go forward .
mr boyd said that despite talks with interested parties there had been no offers to purchase or invest in the society . "

" it is too early in the process for me to say how much of the investment will be paid out and when repayments will be made , " he said .
mr boyd said a formal arrangement would leave the door open for the society to continue in some form or other in the future should the members desire it .
he said £ 21m was paid out to members in october , leaving only £ 4m in the society 's bank account and that between then and november further requests for withdrawals exceeded £ 50m .
the society 's holdings in commercial property were valued at about £ 92m in current market conditions compared with a value of £ 129.5m placed on them in the society 's 2008 annual report .
the society had advanced £ 184m in loans and mr boyd said he was continuing his assessment of various aspects of loans , including the value of property given as security for loans .
he also said that from his review of the society 's loan book it appeared that arrears were increasing because of the current economic climate .

arthur boyd has written to 9,500 pms members , which went into administration in november , recommending " an orderly run down " of its business over time .
he said this would mean part of the members ' investments would be repaid .
mr boyd said if the proposals were rejected the pms would have to go into liquidation and members were likely to receive less this way .
his proposals , and voting papers , were posted so as to arrive with members by thursday .
more than 50 % have to back the plans , with a vote deadline of noon on 30 january , for them to go forward .
mr boyd said that despite talks with interested parties there had been no offers to purchase or invest in the society .
it is too early in the process for me to say how much of the investment will be paid out and when repayments will be made arthur boyd administrator he said while its assets " had not disappeared " , the reality was that the collapse in the uk property market had significantly reduced the value of the pms ' commercial property portfolio and the value of its security over property in its loan book .
" it is too early in the process for me to say how much of the investment will be paid out and when repayments will be made , " he said .
mr boyd said a formal arrangement would leave the door open for the society to continue in some form or other in the future should the members desire it .
he said £ 21m was paid out to members in october , leaving only £ 4m in the society 's bank account and that between then and november further requests for withdrawals exceeded £ 50m .
the society 's holdings in commercial property were valued at about £ 92m in current market conditions compared with a value of £ 129.5m placed on them in the society 's 2008 annual report .
the society had advanced £ 184m in loans and mr boyd said he was continuing his assessment of various aspects of loans , including the value of property given as security for loans .
he also said that from his review of the society 's loan book it appeared that arrears were increasing because of the current economic climate .

arthur boyd has written to 9,500 pms members , which went into administration in november , recommending " an orderly run down " of its business over time .
he said this would mean part of the members ' investments would be repaid .
mr boyd said if the proposals were rejected the pms would have to go into liquidation and members were likely to receive less this way .
his proposals , and voting papers , were posted so as to arrive with members by thursday .
more than 50 % have to back the plans , with a vote deadline of noon on 30 january , for them to go forward .
mr boyd said that despite talks with interested parties there had been no offers to purchase or invest in the society .
it is too early in the process for me to say how much of the investment will be paid out and when repayments will be made arthur boyd administrator he said while its assets " had not disappeared " , the reality was that the collapse in the uk property market had significantly reduced the value of the pms ' commercial property portfolio and the value of its security over property in its loan book .
" it is too early in the process for me to say how much of the investment will be paid out and when repayments will be made , " he said .
mr boyd said a formal arrangement would leave the door open for the society to continue in some form or other in the future should the members desire it .
he said £ 21m was paid out to members in october , leaving only £ 4m in the society 's bank account and that between then and november further requests for withdrawals exceeded £ 50m .
the society 's holdings in commercial property were valued at about £ 92m in current market conditions compared with a value of £ 129.5m placed on them in the society 's 2008 annual report .
the society had advanced £ 184m in loans and mr boyd said he was continuing his assessment of various aspects of loans , including the value of property given as security for loans .
he also said that from his review of the society 's loan book it appeared that arrears were increasing because of the current economic climate .

they had been visiting a local jail when they were intercepted by armed men on motorbikes , he said .
the island is a stronghold of the abu sayyaf group , which is notorious for kidnappings and terror attacks .
a regional military spokeswoman has identified the three aid workers from the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- as swiss andreas notter , italian eugenio vagni and filipino jean lacaba .

but it is understood that the uk government 's welsh secretary has reservations , warning it could face a difficult time in parliament .
there is thought to be particular concern over the possibility of whitehall departments being fined for not making sufficient use of welsh delays in the proposals have led to tension between labour and plaid cymru .
issues correspondence seen by bbc wales indicates fundamental issues around the use of welsh have been the subject of intense discussions between the welsh secretary paul murphy , first minister rhodri morgan and attorney general baroness scotland .
the assembly government has been putting increasing pressure on the wales office to publish the document after a series of delays due to behind-the-scenes wrangles over its breadth and drafting .
paul murphy has warned some clauses could prove too controversial the process , known as a legislative competence order -lrb- lco -rrb- is the first stage in passing a welsh law -lrb- measure -rrb- and will seek -lrb- in this instance -rrb- to give the assembly government more powers over the welsh language .
it is expected to be published on or around 26 january .
if the lco is approved the assembly government will introduce a measure -lrb- welsh law -rrb- over the matter .
before it is approved it has to be scrutinised by both the welsh assembly and westminster .
royal approval for the lco is then needed .
the welsh secretary has sent this lco to his cabinet colleagues for their approval , the final stage of the process before it is published , with a 10-day deadline for them to sign it off .
it is understood the lco , as currently drafted , would give the assembly government powers to enforce language equality , including for private businesses which provide services to the public , which could include water companies and even mobile phone firms .
several labour mps have privately expressed scepticism about extending the scope of current language legislation to the private sector - a concern which has been intensified by the current economic climate .
although mr murphy has agreed the assembly government can publish the lco , so that ams and mps can begin their scrutiny , he has also issued a warning to ministers in cardiff bay that he fears some of the provisions will be so controversial that they may not survive into the final draft .
both ams and mps can scrutinise the proposals once they are published scope until this week , mr murphy was refusing to include a clause that would mean whitehall departments could face financial penalties for failing to comply with language equality legislation .
but officials in the assembly government were adamant it should remain , saying it would " focus the minds " of civil servants in england .
they point to the court service 's introduction of the libra system for issuing court summonses which was introduced with no provision to issue bilingual summonses .
last month , the chair of the welsh language board wrote to the director of the court services in wales describing the situation as an " erosion of a long established welsh-language provision and a blow to the status of the welsh language within the criminal justice system in wales " .
assembly government officials say the court summonses system is an " example of how easily language can slip off the radar " .

but it is understood that the uk government 's welsh secretary has reservations , warning it could face a difficult time in parliament .
there is thought to be particular concern over the possibility of whitehall departments being fined for not making sufficient use of welsh delays in the proposals have led to tension between labour and plaid cymru .
issues correspondence seen by bbc wales indicates fundamental issues around the use of welsh have been the subject of intense discussions between the welsh secretary paul murphy , first minister rhodri morgan and attorney general baroness scotland .
the assembly government has been putting increasing pressure on the wales office to publish the document after a series of delays due to behind-the-scenes wrangles over its breadth and drafting .
the process , known as a legislative competence order -lrb- lco -rrb- is the first stage in passing a welsh law -lrb- measure -rrb- and will seek -lrb- in this instance -rrb- to give the assembly government more powers over the welsh language .
it is expected to be published on or around 26 january .
if the lco is approved the assembly government will introduce a measure -lrb- welsh law -rrb- over the matter .
before it is approved it has to be scrutinised by both the welsh assembly and westminster .
royal approval for the lco is then needed .
the welsh secretary has sent this lco to his cabinet colleagues for their approval , the final stage of the process before it is published , with a 10-day deadline for them to sign it off .
it is understood the lco , as currently drafted , would give the assembly government powers to enforce language equality , including for private businesses which provide services to the public , which could include water companies and even mobile phone firms .
several labour mps have privately expressed scepticism about extending the scope of current language legislation to the private sector - a concern which has been intensified by the current economic climate .
although mr murphy has agreed the assembly government can publish the lco , so that ams and mps can begin their scrutiny , he has also issued a warning to ministers in cardiff bay that he fears some of the provisions will be so controversial that they may not survive into the final draft .
scope until this week , mr murphy was refusing to include a clause that would mean whitehall departments could face financial penalties for failing to comply with language equality legislation .
but officials in the assembly government were adamant it should remain , saying it would " focus the minds " of civil servants in england .
they point to the court service 's introduction of the libra system for issuing court summonses which was introduced with no provision to issue bilingual summonses .
last month , the chair of the welsh language board wrote to the director of the court services in wales describing the situation as an " erosion of a long established welsh-language provision and a blow to the status of the welsh language within the criminal justice system in wales " .
assembly government officials say the court summonses system is an " example of how easily language can slip off the radar " .

the aim is to find out what they do and what they are for .
are they powerless and enjoying the ultimate gravy train or working round-the-clock to make the world a better place ?
he is shadowing meps from all the british parties with the hope of finding the answer .
follow his progress via regular despatches on this page : wednesday 8.30pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
three days in and i have finally had my first glass of champagne - and it was with members of the socialist group .
i promised their press officer i would not make the obvious gag , but come on , i 'm only human ...
anyway , they had a good excuse to break out the bubbly .
they were celebrating east midlands mep glenis willmott ´ s victory in today 's labour group leadership contest .
glenis - who has been a member of the european parliament for just three years - was still waiting for her congratulatory phone call from gordon brown -lrb- he had got through earlier but the line was bad -rrb- .
but she had received a congratulatory text from europe minister caroline flint .
they go way back apparently .
it was a very close-run election - she got ten votes , to east of england mep richard howitt 's nine , but it seems to have been a fairly even-tempered affair .
mr howitt was in the members ' bar to toast her success anyway .
she replaces gary titley who is standing down at the june election .
she is very upbeat about labour ´ s prospects in the poll , citing a yougov poll which suggested the party might gain an extra five meps , and is planning to fight a campaign on bread and butter issues like the economy .
she wants her meps to speak in plain english and avoid euro jargon .
hopefully , it will catch on ...
wednesday 7.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
i could n't help noticing there was a large smoking section in the meps ' members ' bar .
how can this be when smoking in public places is banned in france ?
apparently the parliament authorities had tried to ban it but meps and their staff were determined to puff on with impunity .
one law for them etc ...
wednesday 6.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
i 've finally managed to find an mep who holds constituency surgeries .
labour 's claude moraes , one of the london mep 's , says one of the best things about the british political system is the close link with constituents and he wanted to preserve that .
so he holds surgeries where you can meet him face-to-face , if you book in advance , at his islington office .
he does not criticise those meps who don ´ t hold surgeries .
" it is a very tough job when you have such a large region to cover , " he says .
but he does agree with my suggestion that it helps keep meps honest .
he also has some interesting stuff to say about the rivalry between westminster and brussels .
mps do n't particularly like meps , it seems .
and as a former aide to top labour mps he ought to know what he is talking about .
wednesday 3.20pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
new labour leader a bit of breaking news from strasbourg - labour meps have elected glenis willmott as their new leader .
mrs willmott , who represents the east midlands , is the party 's first female group leader for 16 years .
the former trade union organiser has been a member of the european parliament since february 2006 .
all 19 labour meps were entitled to vote .
ten voted for mrs willmott , nine for east of england mep richard howitt .
an mep answers the what do they do all day question here is how phillip bushill-matthews , a tory mep who is standing down this year , describes his day : " my job as employment spokesman and indeed social affairs coordinator for the largest political group is to help guide colleagues from right across other member states how they should vote on a point-by-point basis on employment and social affairs dossiers .
so there is work to be done right up until the voting sessions as well as in the voting session itself .
" in-between times , there are lots of meetings , either with individuals , with journalists , either friendly or unfriendly , with lobbyists , with constituency workers who are coming out here .
every day is different but our main job at all stages , certainly our job when we are in the european parliament , is to help shape european law .
we have real powers in that area and that is what we do .
" this evening i 'll be dining with half a dozen colleagues in my hotel in strasbourg , where every wednesday we just get together and try to avoid talking about politics but - what a surprise - we always end up talking about political issues . "
wednesday 1pm ...
euro mps ' workload some correspondents have asked for more information on what meps do all day .
by trying to meet up with representatives from all of the british parties , i am inevitably getting something of a fractured picture .
the one thing they all have in common is that they meet in the chamber once a day to vote , normally late morning .
the different parties all arrive with a particular issue they are working on .
for the conservatives , it was pesticides , for the greens it was gaza .
so they will meet members of other groups and try to push their case and agree common positions .
some may be scheduled to speak in debates .
there are also group meetings , which seem to take up a fair amount of time .
believe it or not -lrb- and i know some of you will not -rrb- some of the meps i have met seem to be rushed off their feet .
although almost all seem to look upon strasbourg as an unwanted interruption to their normal working lives in brussels .
some do not arrive here until the tuesday morning and are on the train back by home by 2pm on thursday .
i am told there is not the same social scene there is in brussels and a couple of the meps i have met have genuinely seemed at a bit of a loose end of an evening .
they seemed to spend most of it in their office on their own , catching up on paperwork .
having said that there are , of course , plenty of dinners and receptions going on to keep our elected euro representatives from the luxury of their hotel rooms . * one curious fact is that of all the meps i have met so far , not one has a young family at home in the uk .
they do not have children or their children have grown up and flown the nest .
this does not appear to be a family-friendly job .
wednesday 11.15am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
representing you ?
one of the problems for euro mps is connecting with their constituents .
few british people could name their mep .
and that 's hardly surprising given the huge areas represented and the fact they are elected on a party list system - where you vote for a party rather than a person .
from my conversations so far it seems that few of the uk meps now hold constituency surgeries , arguing that it is not practical , given that they represent millions of people .
some have experimented with mobile surgeries but most seem to restrict their contact with constituents to letters and e-mails - and meeting the lobbies from industry and farming that are a big part of life in brussels and strasbourg .
i saw first hand evidence of that sort of link with the british members seeking to stop the pesticides crackdown being approved on tuesday .
graham watson , the lib dem candidate to be next president of the european parliament -lrb- see below for more on that -rrb- , insists most meps are in close contact with their constituents and will take on individual cases .
but at the same time he says they are not a " universal aunt " in the way that mps are to the people who elect them .
wednesday 11am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
presidential bid just had a very interesting chat with graham watson , who has launched a bid to be the first british president of the european parliament since the 1980s -lrb- the conservative henry plumb since you ask -rrb- .
mr watson has been a lib dem mep since 1994 and has been head of the alde group , one of the biggest party groupings in the parliament , for the past seven and half years .
he believes it is in serious need of reform : " one of the things that frustrates me about this place is that it has never quite convinced me as a parliament . "
he believes the parliament lacks the self-confidence to punch its weight and says it needs " to be a little bit more citizen-friendly and little bit more open " .
crucial to this , he argues , is greater openness and accountability on allowances .
at the moment britain 's 78 euro mps get paid the same as mps , £ 63,291 , but that could go up by as much as £ 20,000 in july , when they will be paid in euros , thanks to the strength of the euro against sterling .
meps also receive an office allowance , a secretarial assistance allowance , an annual travel allowance of up to 4,000 euros and 287 euros per day subsistence allowance for every day they are at the parliament in strasbourg , to cover hotels , taxis and food .
the current european parliament president , hans-gert poettering has reformed the pay and expenses regime to clamp down on abuses - after the next election , meps will have to provide receipts for their expenditure and there will be new rules on employing assistants to prevent abuses .
the current eu president has also set up a working group for parliamentary reform - but mr watson thinks this does not go nearly far enough .
he wants to raise the profile of the parliament 's policies and personalities " so that people will be more motivated to go out and vote " .
he wants the european parliament to work more closely with national parliaments " on the design of legislation that is going to work " and on the implementation of policy .
he says the european parliament has grown in power since he first entered it , when the commission was all-powerful .
now the power resides in the council of ministers , but that institution is increasingly bogged down in disputes between the 27 member states and with parliament 's new power to recall legislation which is not working , he believes it could flex its muscles much more .
like most meps , he is frustrated by the lack of coverage in the british media , compared with france , germany and other countries .
britain is " uniquely and anachronistically " focused on westminster , when many of the real decisions are now taken elsewhere , including in europe , he argues .
but he believes that will change .
issues such as climate change and security can only be tackled at a european and global level , and people are starting to understand this .
it will be down to the 785 meps , from the 27 member states , to decide who will be their next president , although so far mr watson is the only candidate in the race .
he says he is serious about getting elected in july and he promises , or perhaps that should be threatens , to unleash the full force of the lib dem by-election machine - including the infamous focus leaflets - to help fight his cause .
all previous presidents have been elected through back room deals , he says , which tends to be the way things are done here , but he wants this election to be more open and he wants the public to be involved .
you have been warned ...
your questions , comments and suggestions please do point out that those ' well paid meps ' are paid by their own country , not the eu .
they are entitled to the same wage as an mp and only receive european money to cover travel expenses and some aides. sebastiaan , bruges , belgium chloe , -lrb- see comment published on tuesday below -rrb- there are indeed some industrial estate-type buildings to the west of the european parliament ; there 's an exhibition centre , a concert venue , and the old skating rink , none of them great works of architecture .
even closer to the parliament building - literally within a rioting farmer 's stone 's throw , in fact - are some of the nicest local authority -lrb- " council " -rrb- houses in europe , built in the 1930s i think .
if they were in britain , the council would have demolished them long ago and sold the land to a developer for 5p , who would then would have put a large motel there for meps .
nick , strasbourg , france " the european parliament building , in an industrial estate ... "
obviously you have not yet set foot outside the ep building , you will find it is in the ' european quarter ' with the council of europe , court of human rights , european youth centre , there is also an open air swimming pool across the road , as well as a tennis and football club . and lots of houses , one of which i live in !
what industry ?
if you mean the delapidated buildings you pass on the tram that is strasbourg 's exhibition halls !
not quite the nec i know !
nichshee , strasbourg , france please can you ask meps whether they want a european state , and how soon they see it coming if countries do n't start standing up for themselves and their sovereignty jerry c , diss , suffolk having been a european 1930 's depression child , but old enough to largely comprehend the ww2 situation , and its attendant propaganda , the eu sounds like an admirable representative-collaborative enterprise regardless of its faults .
this is more than can be said for westminster type politics .
tom , auckland , new zealand brian , i 'm genuinely surprised that you do n't know why the parliament sits in two seats -lrb- brussels & strasbourg -rrb- .
the original sole seat was strasbourg , but the meps wanted to sit in brussels .
the french government objected and got the two-seat system specifically mentioned in the treaty of amsterdam , so they 're stuck with it .
did you genuinely not know this ?
timothy martin , southampton eu officials do n't like the trip to strasbourg either .
brussels is the centre of things and not just for work , but also things like training courses and language classes , as well as any social life .
strasbourg means cancel plans , miss these things and spend a week with work colleagues rather than friends .
of course , the official line is that it 's am important symbol of european unity and certainly not a bad idea .
anthony , brussels jan willem from brussels , nice to see your stalwart defence of the european union .
however , it does come across a bit oddly to be lectured on the benefits of union by a resident of belgium , a country that does not seem capable of holding itself together .
ian , london wednesday 9am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
where to today ?
morning all and welcome to day three .
thanks for all your emails so far - which range from detailed explanations of the workings of the eu to the suggestion that i take a leaf out of morgan spurlock 's book -lrb- super size me -rrb- and record any weight changes this week .
i 'll consider that latter idea as i tuck into my continental breakfast buffet .
i hope to be looking into the issue of expenses today .
i 've managed to have a chat with a few euro mps on the subject , including timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group .
i will be having a chat later with lib dem chris davies , one of the meps who has blown the whistle on some of the alleged abuses .
i 'll also spending some time with the labour group , as they elect a new leader .
it should be a busy day but i will try and file as many updates as i can . * one thing i am really missing since i came to the european parliament is stairs .
i 'm starting to develop a phobia for the glass lifts that link the different levels in the louise weiss building .
despite being open plan - and refreshingly free from the sort of restrictions you have to put up with in the house of commons - it is not the easiest place to get around .
in what might well be a metaphor for the entire european project , you can see where you want to go , but have to spend a lot of time working out how to get there .
and even then the chances are you will get lost .

the aim is to find out what they do and what they are for .
are they powerless and enjoying the ultimate gravy train or working round-the-clock to make the world a better place ?
he is shadowing meps from all the british parties with the hope of finding the answer .
follow his progress via regular despatches on this page : wednesday 8.30pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
three days in and i have finally had my first glass of champagne - and it was with members of the socialist group .
i promised their press officer i would not make the obvious gag , but come on , i 'm only human ...
anyway , they had a good excuse to break out the bubbly .
they were celebrating east midlands mep glenis willmott ´ s victory in today 's labour group leadership contest .
glenis - who has been a member of the european parliament for just three years - was still waiting for her congratulatory phone call from gordon brown -lrb- he had got through earlier but the line was bad -rrb- .
but she had received a congratulatory text from europe minister caroline flint .
they go way back apparently .
it was a very close-run election - she got ten votes , to east of england mep richard howitt 's nine , but it seems to have been a fairly even-tempered affair .
mr howitt was in the members ' bar to toast her success anyway .
she replaces gary titley who is standing down at the june election .
she is very upbeat about labour ´ s prospects in the poll , citing a yougov poll which suggested the party might gain an extra five meps , and is planning to fight a campaign on bread and butter issues like the economy .
she wants her meps to speak in plain english and avoid euro jargon .
hopefully , it will catch on ...
wednesday 7.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
i could n't help noticing there was a large smoking section in the meps ' members ' bar .
how can this be when smoking in public places is banned in france ?
apparently the parliament authorities had tried to ban it but meps and their staff were determined to puff on with impunity .
one law for them etc ...
wednesday 6.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
i 've finally managed to find an mep who holds constituency surgeries .
labour 's claude moraes , one of the london mep 's , says one of the best things about the british political system is the close link with constituents and he wanted to preserve that .
so he holds surgeries where you can meet him face-to-face , if you book in advance , at his islington office .
he does not criticise those meps who don ´ t hold surgeries .
" it is a very tough job when you have such a large region to cover , " he says .
but he does agree with my suggestion that it helps keep meps honest .
he also has some interesting stuff to say about the rivalry between westminster and brussels .
mps do n't particularly like meps , it seems .
and as a former aide to top labour mps he ought to know what he is talking about .
wednesday 3.20pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
new labour leader a bit of breaking news from strasbourg - labour meps have elected glenis willmott as their new leader .
mrs willmott , who represents the east midlands , is the party 's first female group leader for 16 years .
the former trade union organiser has been a member of the european parliament since february 2006 .
all 19 labour meps were entitled to vote .
ten voted for mrs willmott , nine for east of england mep richard howitt .
an mep answers the what do they do all day question here is how phillip bushill-matthews , a tory mep who is standing down this year , describes his day : " my job as employment spokesman and indeed social affairs coordinator for the largest political group is to help guide colleagues from right across other member states how they should vote on a point-by-point basis on employment and social affairs dossiers .
so there is work to be done right up until the voting sessions as well as in the voting session itself .
" in-between times , there are lots of meetings , either with individuals , with journalists , either friendly or unfriendly , with lobbyists , with constituency workers who are coming out here .
every day is different but our main job at all stages , certainly our job when we are in the european parliament , is to help shape european law .
we have real powers in that area and that is what we do .
" this evening i 'll be dining with half a dozen colleagues in my hotel in strasbourg , where every wednesday we just get together and try to avoid talking about politics but - what a surprise - we always end up talking about political issues . "
wednesday 1pm ...
euro mps ' workload some correspondents have asked for more information on what meps do all day .
by trying to meet up with representatives from all of the british parties , i am inevitably getting something of a fractured picture .
the one thing they all have in common is that they meet in the chamber once a day to vote , normally late morning .
the different parties all arrive with a particular issue they are working on .
for the conservatives , it was pesticides , for the greens it was gaza .
so they will meet members of other groups and try to push their case and agree common positions .
some may be scheduled to speak in debates .
there are also group meetings , which seem to take up a fair amount of time .
believe it or not -lrb- and i know some of you will not -rrb- some of the meps i have met seem to be rushed off their feet .
although almost all seem to look upon strasbourg as an unwanted interruption to their normal working lives in brussels .
some do not arrive here until the tuesday morning and are on the train back by home by 2pm on thursday .
i am told there is not the same social scene there is in brussels and a couple of the meps i have met have genuinely seemed at a bit of a loose end of an evening .
they seemed to spend most of it in their office on their own , catching up on paperwork .
having said that there are , of course , plenty of dinners and receptions going on to keep our elected euro representatives from the luxury of their hotel rooms . * one curious fact is that of all the meps i have met so far , not one has a young family at home in the uk .
they do not have children or their children have grown up and flown the nest .
this does not appear to be a family-friendly job .
wednesday 11.15am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...

wednesday 6.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
i 've finally managed to find an mep who holds constituency surgeries .
labour 's claude moraes , one of the london mep 's , says one of the best things about the british political system is the close link with constituents and he wanted to preserve that .
so he holds surgeries where you can meet him face-to-face , if you book in advance , at his islington office .
he does not criticise those meps who don ´ t hold surgeries .
" it is a very tough job when you have such a large region to cover , " he says .
but he does agree with my suggestion that it helps keep meps honest .
he also has some interesting stuff to say about the rivalry between westminster and brussels .
mps do n't particularly like meps , it seems .
and as a former aide to top labour mps he ought to know what he is talking about .
wednesday 3.20pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
new labour leader a bit of breaking news from strasbourg - labour meps have elected glenis willmott as their new leader .
mrs willmott , who represents the east midlands , is the party 's first female group leader for 16 years .
the former trade union organiser has been a member of the european parliament since february 2006 .
all 19 labour meps were entitled to vote .
ten voted for mrs willmott , nine for east of england mep richard howitt .
an mep answers the what do they do all day question here is how phillip bushill-matthews , a tory mep who is standing down this year , describes his day : " my job as employment spokesman and indeed social affairs coordinator for the largest political group is to help guide colleagues from right across other member states how they should vote on a point-by-point basis on employment and social affairs dossiers .
so there is work to be done right up until the voting sessions as well as in the voting session itself .
" in-between times , there are lots of meetings , either with individuals , with journalists , either friendly or unfriendly , with lobbyists , with constituency workers who are coming out here .
every day is different but our main job at all stages , certainly our job when we are in the european parliament , is to help shape european law .
we have real powers in that area and that is what we do .
" this evening i 'll be dining with half a dozen colleagues in my hotel in strasbourg , where every wednesday we just get together and try to avoid talking about politics but - what a surprise - we always end up talking about political issues . "
wednesday 1pm ...
euro mps ' workload some correspondents have asked for more information on what meps do all day .
by trying to meet up with representatives from all of the british parties , i am inevitably getting something of a fractured picture .
the one thing they all have in common is that they meet in the chamber once a day to vote , normally late morning .
the different parties all arrive with a particular issue they are working on .
for the conservatives , it was pesticides , for the greens it was gaza .
so they will meet members of other groups and try to push their case and agree common positions .
some may be scheduled to speak in debates .
there are also group meetings , which seem to take up a fair amount of time .
believe it or not -lrb- and i know some of you will not -rrb- some of the meps i have met seem to be rushed off their feet .
although almost all seem to look upon strasbourg as an unwanted interruption to their normal working lives in brussels .
some do not arrive here until the tuesday morning and are on the train back by home by 2pm on thursday .
i am told there is not the same social scene there is in brussels and a couple of the meps i have met have genuinely seemed at a bit of a loose end of an evening .
they seemed to spend most of it in their office on their own , catching up on paperwork .
having said that there are , of course , plenty of dinners and receptions going on to keep our elected euro representatives from the luxury of their hotel rooms . * one curious fact is that of all the meps i have met so far , not one has a young family at home in the uk .
they do not have children or their children have grown up and flown the nest .
this does not appear to be a family-friendly job .
wednesday 11.15am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
representing you ?
one of the problems for euro mps is connecting with their constituents .
few british people could name their mep .
and that 's hardly surprising given the huge areas represented and the fact they are elected on a party list system - where you vote for a party rather than a person .
from my conversations so far it seems that few of the uk meps now hold constituency surgeries , arguing that it is not practical , given that they represent millions of people .
some have experimented with mobile surgeries but most seem to restrict their contact with constituents to letters and e-mails - and meeting the lobbies from industry and farming that are a big part of life in brussels and strasbourg .
i saw first hand evidence of that sort of link with the british members seeking to stop the pesticides crackdown being approved on tuesday .
graham watson , the lib dem candidate to be next president of the european parliament -lrb- see below for more on that -rrb- , insists most meps are in close contact with their constituents and will take on individual cases .
but at the same time he says they are not a " universal aunt " in the way that mps are to the people who elect them .
wednesday 11am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
presidential bid just had a very interesting chat with graham watson , who has launched a bid to be the first british president of the european parliament since the 1980s -lrb- the conservative henry plumb since you ask -rrb- .
mr watson has been a lib dem mep since 1994 and has been head of the alde group , one of the biggest party groupings in the parliament , for the past seven and half years .
he believes it is in serious need of reform : " one of the things that frustrates me about this place is that it has never quite convinced me as a parliament . "
he believes the parliament lacks the self-confidence to punch its weight and says it needs " to be a little bit more citizen-friendly and little bit more open " .
crucial to this , he argues , is greater openness and accountability on allowances .
at the moment britain 's 78 euro mps get paid the same as mps , £ 63,291 , but that could go up by as much as £ 20,000 in july , when they will be paid in euros , thanks to the strength of the euro against sterling .
meps also receive an office allowance , a secretarial assistance allowance , an annual travel allowance of up to 4,000 euros and 287 euros per day subsistence allowance for every day they are at the parliament in strasbourg , to cover hotels , taxis and food .
the current european parliament president , hans-gert poettering has reformed the pay and expenses regime to clamp down on abuses - after the next election , meps will have to provide receipts for their expenditure and there will be new rules on employing assistants to prevent abuses .
the current eu president has also set up a working group for parliamentary reform - but mr watson thinks this does not go nearly far enough .
he wants to raise the profile of the parliament 's policies and personalities " so that people will be more motivated to go out and vote " .
he wants the european parliament to work more closely with national parliaments " on the design of legislation that is going to work " and on the implementation of policy .
he says the european parliament has grown in power since he first entered it , when the commission was all-powerful .
now the power resides in the council of ministers , but that institution is increasingly bogged down in disputes between the 27 member states and with parliament 's new power to recall legislation which is not working , he believes it could flex its muscles much more .
like most meps , he is frustrated by the lack of coverage in the british media , compared with france , germany and other countries .
britain is " uniquely and anachronistically " focused on westminster , when many of the real decisions are now taken elsewhere , including in europe , he argues .
but he believes that will change .
issues such as climate change and security can only be tackled at a european and global level , and people are starting to understand this .
it will be down to the 785 meps , from the 27 member states , to decide who will be their next president , although so far mr watson is the only candidate in the race .
he says he is serious about getting elected in july and he promises , or perhaps that should be threatens , to unleash the full force of the lib dem by-election machine - including the infamous focus leaflets - to help fight his cause .
all previous presidents have been elected through back room deals , he says , which tends to be the way things are done here , but he wants this election to be more open and he wants the public to be involved .
you have been warned ...
your questions , comments and suggestions please do point out that those ' well paid meps ' are paid by their own country , not the eu .
they are entitled to the same wage as an mp and only receive european money to cover travel expenses and some aides. sebastiaan , bruges , belgium chloe , -lrb- see comment published on tuesday below -rrb- there are indeed some industrial estate-type buildings to the west of the european parliament ; there 's an exhibition centre , a concert venue , and the old skating rink , none of them great works of architecture .
even closer to the parliament building - literally within a rioting farmer 's stone 's throw , in fact - are some of the nicest local authority -lrb- " council " -rrb- houses in europe , built in the 1930s i think .
if they were in britain , the council would have demolished them long ago and sold the land to a developer for 5p , who would then would have put a large motel there for meps .
nick , strasbourg , france " the european parliament building , in an industrial estate ... "
obviously you have not yet set foot outside the ep building , you will find it is in the ' european quarter ' with the council of europe , court of human rights , european youth centre , there is also an open air swimming pool across the road , as well as a tennis and football club . and lots of houses , one of which i live in !
what industry ?
if you mean the delapidated buildings you pass on the tram that is strasbourg 's exhibition halls !
not quite the nec i know !
nichshee , strasbourg , france please can you ask meps whether they want a european state , and how soon they see it coming if countries do n't start standing up for themselves and their sovereignty jerry c , diss , suffolk having been a european 1930 's depression child , but old enough to largely comprehend the ww2 situation , and its attendant propaganda , the eu sounds like an admirable representative-collaborative enterprise regardless of its faults .
this is more than can be said for westminster type politics .
tom , auckland , new zealand brian , i 'm genuinely surprised that you do n't know why the parliament sits in two seats -lrb- brussels & strasbourg -rrb- .
the original sole seat was strasbourg , but the meps wanted to sit in brussels .
the french government objected and got the two-seat system specifically mentioned in the treaty of amsterdam , so they 're stuck with it .
did you genuinely not know this ?
timothy martin , southampton eu officials do n't like the trip to strasbourg either .
brussels is the centre of things and not just for work , but also things like training courses and language classes , as well as any social life .
strasbourg means cancel plans , miss these things and spend a week with work colleagues rather than friends .
of course , the official line is that it 's am important symbol of european unity and certainly not a bad idea .
anthony , brussels jan willem from brussels , nice to see your stalwart defence of the european union .
however , it does come across a bit oddly to be lectured on the benefits of union by a resident of belgium , a country that does not seem capable of holding itself together .
ian , london wednesday 9am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
where to today ?
morning all and welcome to day three .
thanks for all your emails so far - which range from detailed explanations of the workings of the eu to the suggestion that i take a leaf out of morgan spurlock 's book -lrb- super size me -rrb- and record any weight changes this week .
i 'll consider that latter idea as i tuck into my continental breakfast buffet .
i hope to be looking into the issue of expenses today .
i 've managed to have a chat with a few euro mps on the subject , including timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group .
i will be having a chat later with lib dem chris davies , one of the meps who has blown the whistle on some of the alleged abuses .
i 'll also spending some time with the labour group , as they elect a new leader .
it should be a busy day but i will try and file as many updates as i can . * one thing i am really missing since i came to the european parliament is stairs .
i 'm starting to develop a phobia for the glass lifts that link the different levels in the louise weiss building .
despite being open plan - and refreshingly free from the sort of restrictions you have to put up with in the house of commons - it is not the easiest place to get around .
in what might well be a metaphor for the entire european project , you can see where you want to go , but have to spend a lot of time working out how to get there .
and even then the chances are you will get lost .

the aim is to find out what they do and what they are for .
are they powerless and enjoying the ultimate gravy train or working round-the-clock to make the world a better place ?
he is shadowing meps from all the british parties with the hope of finding the answer .
follow his progress via regular despatches on this page : wednesday 8.30pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
three days in and i have finally had my first glass of champagne - and it was with members of the socialist group .
i promised their press officer i would not make the obvious gag , but come on , i 'm only human ...
anyway , they had a good excuse to break out the bubbly .
they were celebrating east midlands mep glenis willmott ´ s victory in today 's labour group leadership contest .
glenis - who has been a member of the european parliament for just three years - was still waiting for her congratulatory phone call from gordon brown -lrb- he had got through earlier but the line was bad -rrb- .
but she had received a congratulatory text from europe minister caroline flint .
they go way back apparently .
it was a very close-run election - she got ten votes , to east of england mep richard howitt 's nine , but it seems to have been a fairly even-tempered affair .
mr howitt was in the members ' bar to toast her success anyway .
she replaces gary titley who is standing down at the june election .
she is very upbeat about labour ´ s prospects in the poll , citing a yougov poll which suggested the party might gain an extra five meps , and is planning to fight a campaign on bread and butter issues like the economy .
she wants her meps to speak in plain english and avoid euro jargon .
hopefully , it will catch on ...
wednesday 7.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
i could n't help noticing there was a large smoking section in the meps ' members ' bar .
how can this be when smoking in public places is banned in france ?
apparently the parliament authorities had tried to ban it but meps and their staff were determined to puff on with impunity .
one law for them etc ...

the aim is to find out what they do and what they are for .
are they powerless and enjoying the ultimate gravy train or working round-the-clock to make the world a better place ?
he is shadowing meps from all the british parties with the hope of finding the answer .
follow his progress via regular despatches on this page : wednesday 8.30pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
three days in and i have finally had my first glass of champagne - and it was with members of the socialist group .
i promised their press officer i would not make the obvious gag , but come on , i 'm only human ...
anyway , they had a good excuse to break out the bubbly .
they were celebrating east midlands mep glenis willmott ´ s victory in today 's labour group leadership contest .
glenis - who has been a member of the european parliament for just three years - was still waiting for her congratulatory phone call from gordon brown -lrb- he had got through earlier but the line was bad -rrb- .
but she had received a congratulatory text from europe minister caroline flint .
they go way back apparently .
it was a very close-run election - she got ten votes , to east of england mep richard howitt 's nine , but it seems to have been a fairly even-tempered affair .
mr howitt was in the members ' bar to toast her success anyway .
she replaces gary titley who is standing down at the june election .
she is very upbeat about labour ´ s prospects in the poll , citing a yougov poll which suggested the party might gain an extra five meps , and is planning to fight a campaign on bread and butter issues like the economy .
she wants her meps to speak in plain english and avoid euro jargon .
hopefully , it will catch on ...
wednesday 7.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ..
i could n't help noticing there was a large smoking section in the meps ' members ' bar .
how can this be when smoking in public places is banned in france ?
apparently the parliament authorities had tried to ban it but meps and their staff were determined to puff on with impunity .
one law for them etc ...
wednesday 6.00pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
i 've finally managed to find an mep who holds constituency surgeries .
labour 's claude moraes , one of the london mep 's , says one of the best things about the british political system is the close link with constituents and he wanted to preserve that .
so he holds surgeries where you can meet him face-to-face , if you book in advance , at his islington office .
he does not criticise those meps who don ´ t hold surgeries .
" it is a very tough job when you have such a large region to cover , " he says .
but he does agree with my suggestion that it helps keep meps honest .
he also has some interesting stuff to say about the rivalry between westminster and brussels .
mps do n't particularly like meps , it seems .
and as a former aide to top labour mps he ought to know what he is talking about .
wednesday 3.20pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
new labour leader a bit of breaking news from strasbourg - labour meps have elected glenis willmott as their new leader .
mrs willmott , who represents the east midlands , is the party 's first female group leader for 16 years .
the former trade union organiser has been a member of the european parliament since february 2006 .
all 19 labour meps were entitled to vote .
ten voted for mrs willmott , nine for east of england mep richard howitt .
an mep answers the what do they do all day question here is how phillip bushill-matthews , a tory mep who is standing down this year , describes his day : " my job as employment spokesman and indeed social affairs coordinator for the largest political group is to help guide colleagues from right across other member states how they should vote on a point-by-point basis on employment and social affairs dossiers .
so there is work to be done right up until the voting sessions as well as in the voting session itself .
" in-between times , there are lots of meetings , either with individuals , with journalists , either friendly or unfriendly , with lobbyists , with constituency workers who are coming out here .
every day is different but our main job at all stages , certainly our job when we are in the european parliament , is to help shape european law .
we have real powers in that area and that is what we do .
" this evening i 'll be dining with half a dozen colleagues in my hotel in strasbourg , where every wednesday we just get together and try to avoid talking about politics but - what a surprise - we always end up talking about political issues . "
wednesday 1pm ...
euro mps ' workload some correspondents have asked for more information on what meps do all day .
by trying to meet up with representatives from all of the british parties , i am inevitably getting something of a fractured picture .
the one thing they all have in common is that they meet in the chamber once a day to vote , normally late morning .
the different parties all arrive with a particular issue they are working on .
for the conservatives , it was pesticides , for the greens it was gaza .
so they will meet members of other groups and try to push their case and agree common positions .
some may be scheduled to speak in debates .
there are also group meetings , which seem to take up a fair amount of time .
believe it or not -lrb- and i know some of you will not -rrb- some of the meps i have met seem to be rushed off their feet .
although almost all seem to look upon strasbourg as an unwanted interruption to their normal working lives in brussels .
some do not arrive here until the tuesday morning and are on the train back by home by 2pm on thursday .
i am told there is not the same social scene there is in brussels and a couple of the meps i have met have genuinely seemed at a bit of a loose end of an evening .
they seemed to spend most of it in their office on their own , catching up on paperwork .
having said that there are , of course , plenty of dinners and receptions going on to keep our elected euro representatives from the luxury of their hotel rooms . * one curious fact is that of all the meps i have met so far , not one has a young family at home in the uk .
they do not have children or their children have grown up and flown the nest .
this does not appear to be a family-friendly job .
wednesday 11.15am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
representing you ?
one of the problems for euro mps is connecting with their constituents .
few british people could name their mep .
and that 's hardly surprising given the huge areas represented and the fact they are elected on a party list system - where you vote for a party rather than a person .
from my conversations so far it seems that few of the uk meps now hold constituency surgeries , arguing that it is not practical , given that they represent millions of people .
some have experimented with mobile surgeries but most seem to restrict their contact with constituents to letters and e-mails - and meeting the lobbies from industry and farming that are a big part of life in brussels and strasbourg .
i saw first hand evidence of that sort of link with the british members seeking to stop the pesticides crackdown being approved on tuesday .
graham watson , the lib dem candidate to be next president of the european parliament -lrb- see below for more on that -rrb- , insists most meps are in close contact with their constituents and will take on individual cases .
but at the same time he says they are not a " universal aunt " in the way that mps are to the people who elect them .
wednesday 11am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
presidential bid just had a very interesting chat with graham watson , who has launched a bid to be the first british president of the european parliament since the 1980s -lrb- the conservative henry plumb since you ask -rrb- .
mr watson has been a lib dem mep since 1994 and has been head of the alde group , one of the biggest party groupings in the parliament , for the past seven and half years .
he believes it is in serious need of reform : " one of the things that frustrates me about this place is that it has never quite convinced me as a parliament . "
he believes the parliament lacks the self-confidence to punch its weight and says it needs " to be a little bit more citizen-friendly and little bit more open " .
crucial to this , he argues , is greater openness and accountability on allowances .
at the moment britain 's 78 euro mps get paid the same as mps , £ 63,291 , but that could go up by as much as £ 20,000 in july , when they will be paid in euros , thanks to the strength of the euro against sterling .
meps also receive an office allowance , a secretarial assistance allowance , an annual travel allowance of up to 4,000 euros and 287 euros per day subsistence allowance for every day they are at the parliament in strasbourg , to cover hotels , taxis and food .
the current european parliament president , hans-gert poettering has reformed the pay and expenses regime to clamp down on abuses - after the next election , meps will have to provide receipts for their expenditure and there will be new rules on employing assistants to prevent abuses .
the current eu president has also set up a working group for parliamentary reform - but mr watson thinks this does not go nearly far enough .
he wants to raise the profile of the parliament 's policies and personalities " so that people will be more motivated to go out and vote " .
he wants the european parliament to work more closely with national parliaments " on the design of legislation that is going to work " and on the implementation of policy .
he says the european parliament has grown in power since he first entered it , when the commission was all-powerful .
now the power resides in the council of ministers , but that institution is increasingly bogged down in disputes between the 27 member states and with parliament 's new power to recall legislation which is not working , he believes it could flex its muscles much more .
like most meps , he is frustrated by the lack of coverage in the british media , compared with france , germany and other countries .
britain is " uniquely and anachronistically " focused on westminster , when many of the real decisions are now taken elsewhere , including in europe , he argues .
but he believes that will change .
issues such as climate change and security can only be tackled at a european and global level , and people are starting to understand this .
it will be down to the 785 meps , from the 27 member states , to decide who will be their next president , although so far mr watson is the only candidate in the race .
he says he is serious about getting elected in july and he promises , or perhaps that should be threatens , to unleash the full force of the lib dem by-election machine - including the infamous focus leaflets - to help fight his cause .
all previous presidents have been elected through back room deals , he says , which tends to be the way things are done here , but he wants this election to be more open and he wants the public to be involved .
you have been warned ...
your questions , comments and suggestions please do point out that those ' well paid meps ' are paid by their own country , not the eu .
they are entitled to the same wage as an mp and only receive european money to cover travel expenses and some aides. sebastiaan , bruges , belgium chloe , -lrb- see comment published on tuesday below -rrb- there are indeed some industrial estate-type buildings to the west of the european parliament ; there 's an exhibition centre , a concert venue , and the old skating rink , none of them great works of architecture .
even closer to the parliament building - literally within a rioting farmer 's stone 's throw , in fact - are some of the nicest local authority -lrb- " council " -rrb- houses in europe , built in the 1930s i think .
if they were in britain , the council would have demolished them long ago and sold the land to a developer for 5p , who would then would have put a large motel there for meps .
nick , strasbourg , france " the european parliament building , in an industrial estate ... "
obviously you have not yet set foot outside the ep building , you will find it is in the ' european quarter ' with the council of europe , court of human rights , european youth centre , there is also an open air swimming pool across the road , as well as a tennis and football club . and lots of houses , one of which i live in !
what industry ?
if you mean the delapidated buildings you pass on the tram that is strasbourg 's exhibition halls !
not quite the nec i know !
nichshee , strasbourg , france please can you ask meps whether they want a european state , and how soon they see it coming if countries do n't start standing up for themselves and their sovereignty jerry c , diss , suffolk having been a european 1930 's depression child , but old enough to largely comprehend the ww2 situation , and its attendant propaganda , the eu sounds like an admirable representative-collaborative enterprise regardless of its faults .
this is more than can be said for westminster type politics .
tom , auckland , new zealand brian , i 'm genuinely surprised that you do n't know why the parliament sits in two seats -lrb- brussels & strasbourg -rrb- .
the original sole seat was strasbourg , but the meps wanted to sit in brussels .
the french government objected and got the two-seat system specifically mentioned in the treaty of amsterdam , so they 're stuck with it .
did you genuinely not know this ?
timothy martin , southampton eu officials do n't like the trip to strasbourg either .
brussels is the centre of things and not just for work , but also things like training courses and language classes , as well as any social life .
strasbourg means cancel plans , miss these things and spend a week with work colleagues rather than friends .
of course , the official line is that it 's am important symbol of european unity and certainly not a bad idea .
anthony , brussels jan willem from brussels , nice to see your stalwart defence of the european union .
however , it does come across a bit oddly to be lectured on the benefits of union by a resident of belgium , a country that does not seem capable of holding itself together .
ian , london wednesday 9am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
where to today ?
morning all and welcome to day three .
thanks for all your emails so far - which range from detailed explanations of the workings of the eu to the suggestion that i take a leaf out of morgan spurlock 's book -lrb- super size me -rrb- and record any weight changes this week .
i 'll consider that latter idea as i tuck into my continental breakfast buffet .
i hope to be looking into the issue of expenses today .
i 've managed to have a chat with a few euro mps on the subject , including timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group .
i will be having a chat later with lib dem chris davies , one of the meps who has blown the whistle on some of the alleged abuses .
i 'll also spending some time with the labour group , as they elect a new leader .
it should be a busy day but i will try and file as many updates as i can . * one thing i am really missing since i came to the european parliament is stairs .
i 'm starting to develop a phobia for the glass lifts that link the different levels in the louise weiss building .
despite being open plan - and refreshingly free from the sort of restrictions you have to put up with in the house of commons - it is not the easiest place to get around .
in what might well be a metaphor for the entire european project , you can see where you want to go , but have to spend a lot of time working out how to get there .
and even then the chances are you will get lost .

even closer to the parliament building - literally within a rioting farmer 's stone 's throw , in fact - are some of the nicest local authority -lrb- " council " -rrb- houses in europe , built in the 1930s i think .
if they were in britain , the council would have demolished them long ago and sold the land to a developer for 5p , who would then would have put a large motel there for meps .
nick , strasbourg , france " the european parliament building , in an industrial estate ... "
obviously you have not yet set foot outside the ep building , you will find it is in the ' european quarter ' with the council of europe , court of human rights , european youth centre , there is also an open air swimming pool across the road , as well as a tennis and football club . and lots of houses , one of which i live in !
what industry ?
if you mean the delapidated buildings you pass on the tram that is strasbourg 's exhibition halls !
not quite the nec i know !
nichshee , strasbourg , france please can you ask meps whether they want a european state , and how soon they see it coming if countries do n't start standing up for themselves and their sovereignty jerry c , diss , suffolk having been a european 1930 's depression child , but old enough to largely comprehend the ww2 situation , and its attendant propaganda , the eu sounds like an admirable representative-collaborative enterprise regardless of its faults .
this is more than can be said for westminster type politics .
tom , auckland , new zealand brian , i 'm genuinely surprised that you do n't know why the parliament sits in two seats -lrb- brussels & strasbourg -rrb- .
the original sole seat was strasbourg , but the meps wanted to sit in brussels .
the french government objected and got the two-seat system specifically mentioned in the treaty of amsterdam , so they 're stuck with it .
did you genuinely not know this ?
timothy martin , southampton eu officials do n't like the trip to strasbourg either .
brussels is the centre of things and not just for work , but also things like training courses and language classes , as well as any social life .
strasbourg means cancel plans , miss these things and spend a week with work colleagues rather than friends .
of course , the official line is that it 's am important symbol of european unity and certainly not a bad idea .
anthony , brussels jan willem from brussels , nice to see your stalwart defence of the european union .
however , it does come across a bit oddly to be lectured on the benefits of union by a resident of belgium , a country that does not seem capable of holding itself together .
ian , london wednesday 9am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
where to today ?
morning all and welcome to day three .
thanks for all your emails so far - which range from detailed explanations of the workings of the eu to the suggestion that i take a leaf out of morgan spurlock 's book -lrb- super size me -rrb- and record any weight changes this week .
i 'll consider that latter idea as i tuck into my continental breakfast buffet .
i hope to be looking into the issue of expenses today .
i 've managed to have a chat with a few euro mps on the subject , including timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group .
i will be having a chat later with lib dem chris davies , one of the meps who has blown the whistle on some of the alleged abuses .
i 'll also spending some time with the labour group , as they elect a new leader .
it should be a busy day but i will try and file as many updates as i can . * one thing i am really missing since i came to the european parliament is stairs .
i 'm starting to develop a phobia for the glass lifts that link the different levels in the louise weiss building .
despite being open plan - and refreshingly free from the sort of restrictions you have to put up with in the house of commons - it is not the easiest place to get around .
in what might well be a metaphor for the entire european project , you can see where you want to go , but have to spend a lot of time working out how to get there .
and even then the chances are you will get lost .

highland council said it did not make " financial sense " until it reduced its high loan debt .
it said the scottish government subsidy available would , " at best " , cover about 20 % of supplying new council houses .
however , the equivalent housing association grant subsidy would be nearer 70 % . "
we know that our communities and tenants want us to build council houses again " margaret davidson housing and social work chairwoman margaret davidson , highland 's housing and social work chairwoman , said the council would assure the scottish government it was committed - and has real enthusiasm - to increasing housing supply .
she said : " it 's a real disappointment that we are unable to undertake new council house building in the highlands at this time .
the sums do not add up .
" we know that our communities and tenants want us to build council houses again .
" unfortunately , given the other issues we face in terms of housing debt , we simply can not construct a workable business case on the current subsidy levels involved . "
on wednesday , council house rents in the highlands were to increase by an average of £ 2.46-a-week.
highland council said the raise was needed to help meet the cost of a £ 13.2m upgrade of local authority housing in 2009/10 .
the council said about £ 88m would need to be spent over the next six years to bring its stock up to national standards .
the work would include installing new kitchens and energy saving materials .

highland council said it did not make " financial sense " until it reduced its high loan debt .
it said the scottish government subsidy available would , " at best " , cover about 20 % of supplying new council houses .
however , the equivalent housing association grant subsidy would be nearer 70 % .

she said : " it 's a real disappointment that we are unable to undertake new council house building in the highlands at this time .
the sums do not add up .
" we know that our communities and tenants want us to build council houses again .
" unfortunately , given the other issues we face in terms of housing debt , we simply can not construct a workable business case on the current subsidy levels involved . "
on wednesday , council house rents in the highlands were to increase by an average of £ 2.46-a-week.
highland council said the raise was needed to help meet the cost of a £ 13.2m upgrade of local authority housing in 2009/10 .
the council said about £ 88m would need to be spent over the next six years to bring its stock up to national standards .
the work would include installing new kitchens and energy saving materials .
