program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate boris nemtsov says the campaign was anything but free and fair boris nemtsov , communist candidate yury dzagania and billionaire alexander lebedev have all sued the pro-kremlin candidate and the acting mayor anatoli pakhomov for purported abuse of office during the election campaign .
they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate boris nemtsov says the campaign was anything but free and fair boris nemtsov , communist candidate yury dzagania and billionaire alexander lebedev have all sued the pro-kremlin candidate and the acting mayor anatoli pakhomov for purported abuse of office during the election campaign .
they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

students are required to take an ethics course and may take additional religion courses if they want .
had the referendum passed , students could have picked ethics or religion , which is the case in the rest of germany . berlin became the exception to the rule in 2006 after ethics classes became compulsory .
the change followed an " honor killing " of a turkish woman in 2005 by her brothers in berlin because her family disapproved of her western lifestyle . the referendum had been supported by german chancellor angela merkel , the churches and several prominent personalities .
proponents argued that due to the mandatory ethics classes , attendance was falling at optional religion courses in berlin schools . mz / jam , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate boris nemtsov says the campaign was anything but free and fair boris nemtsov , communist candidate yury dzagania and billionaire alexander lebedev have all sued the pro-kremlin candidate and the acting mayor anatoli pakhomov for purported abuse of office during the election campaign .
they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate boris nemtsov says the campaign was anything but free and fair boris nemtsov , communist candidate yury dzagania and billionaire alexander lebedev have all sued the pro-kremlin candidate and the acting mayor anatoli pakhomov for purported abuse of office during the election campaign .
they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath 's side failed to score for the first time in 13 games wolfsburg were foiled several times by keeper gerhard tremmel who did well to keep out an early zvejezdan misimovic effort and pulled off another fine save when he thwarted cristian zaccardo almost immediately after rangelov 's goal .
brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .
cottbus are now out of the relegation zone , on 26 points , one ahead of bielefeld and two up on moenchengladbach , with karlsruhe two points further adrift in last place .
moenchengladbach took the lead against bielefeld through algerian striker karim matmour in the 13th minute , only for the visitors to level through robert tesche in the 32nd . nrt / md dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath 's side failed to score for the first time in 13 games wolfsburg were foiled several times by keeper gerhard tremmel who did well to keep out an early zvejezdan misimovic effort and pulled off another fine save when he thwarted cristian zaccardo almost immediately after rangelov 's goal .
brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .
cottbus are now out of the relegation zone , on 26 points , one ahead of bielefeld and two up on moenchengladbach , with karlsruhe two points further adrift in last place .
moenchengladbach took the lead against bielefeld through algerian striker karim matmour in the 13th minute , only for the visitors to level through robert tesche in the 32nd . nrt / md dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .
jumping the border across the northern border , health authorities in the central us state of kansas confirmed two cases of swine flu on saturday , bringing the total number of cases in the united states to at least 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that swine flu will travel are being realized one of the victims was still ill while the other had recovered , kansas health authorities said .
one of the patients had recently traveled to mexico .
" both persons ... became ill with the same unique -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- strain of swine flu that has been identified in mexico , california and texas , " kansas officials said in a statement .
earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .
health officials sunday also confirmed that eight new york school students were diagnosed with a swine flu similar to the strain blamed for dozens of deaths in mexico .
about 100 students began feeling ill at a new york school last week and nine swabs were taken from them .
eight tests were positive , the city 's health department said .
however , the students only suffered mild symptoms and most were now recovering . nda / jam , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .

they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .

brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .
cottbus are now out of the relegation zone , on 26 points , one ahead of bielefeld and two up on moenchengladbach , with karlsruhe two points further adrift in last place .

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .

russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath 's side failed to score for the first time in 13 games wolfsburg were foiled several times by keeper gerhard tremmel who did well to keep out an early zvejezdan misimovic effort and pulled off another fine save when he thwarted cristian zaccardo almost immediately after rangelov 's goal .
brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .
cottbus are now out of the relegation zone , on 26 points , one ahead of bielefeld and two up on moenchengladbach , with karlsruhe two points further adrift in last place .
moenchengladbach took the lead against bielefeld through algerian striker karim matmour in the 13th minute , only for the visitors to level through robert tesche in the 32nd . nrt / md dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .
jumping the border across the northern border , health authorities in the central us state of kansas confirmed two cases of swine flu on saturday , bringing the total number of cases in the united states to at least 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that swine flu will travel are being realized one of the victims was still ill while the other had recovered , kansas health authorities said .
one of the patients had recently traveled to mexico .
" both persons ... became ill with the same unique -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- strain of swine flu that has been identified in mexico , california and texas , " kansas officials said in a statement .
earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .

he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .

" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath 's side failed to score for the first time in 13 games wolfsburg were foiled several times by keeper gerhard tremmel who did well to keep out an early zvejezdan misimovic effort and pulled off another fine save when he thwarted cristian zaccardo almost immediately after rangelov 's goal .
brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .
cottbus are now out of the relegation zone , on 26 points , one ahead of bielefeld and two up on moenchengladbach , with karlsruhe two points further adrift in last place .
moenchengladbach took the lead against bielefeld through algerian striker karim matmour in the 13th minute , only for the visitors to level through robert tesche in the 32nd . nrt / md dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .

pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "

it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .

they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath 's side failed to score for the first time in 13 games wolfsburg were foiled several times by keeper gerhard tremmel who did well to keep out an early zvejezdan misimovic effort and pulled off another fine save when he thwarted cristian zaccardo almost immediately after rangelov 's goal .
brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .
cottbus are now out of the relegation zone , on 26 points , one ahead of bielefeld and two up on moenchengladbach , with karlsruhe two points further adrift in last place .
moenchengladbach took the lead against bielefeld through algerian striker karim matmour in the 13th minute , only for the visitors to level through robert tesche in the 32nd . nrt / md dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

none of the ship ’ s 1,500 passengers and crew were injured and will continue on their scheduled route – with an escort . the melody was on its way from the seychelles to italy on saturday evening when six men in a small speed boat approached the ship and opened fire .
according to the ship ’ s captain , ciro pinto , the pirates attempted to board the ship by placing a ladder on the bow . however security personal on board returned fire , “ and when they saw we were shooting , they abandoned their effort and went away , ” pinto said . he reported light damage to the ship from bullets . the melody is owned by the italian company msc .
according to a company spokeswoman , msc has never had a problem with pirates in the past . “ we didn ’ t choose a dangerous route , ” she said , adding that the company is shocked and the pirate attack will “ surely have consequences for our future route planning . ” armed security on board domenico pellegrino , the managing director of msc , said that israeli security guards were on board .

none of the ship ’ s 1,500 passengers and crew were injured and will continue on their scheduled route – with an escort . the melody was on its way from the seychelles to italy on saturday evening when six men in a small speed boat approached the ship and opened fire .

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria .

as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .

" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath 's side failed to score for the first time in 13 games wolfsburg were foiled several times by keeper gerhard tremmel who did well to keep out an early zvejezdan misimovic effort and pulled off another fine save when he thwarted cristian zaccardo almost immediately after rangelov 's goal .
brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .

26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .

the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .

" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .

26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .

according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .

in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "

travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .
health officials sunday also confirmed that eight new york school students were diagnosed with a swine flu similar to the strain blamed for dozens of deaths in mexico .
about 100 students began feeling ill at a new york school last week and nine swabs were taken from them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .

brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .

26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .

the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .

since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .
jumping the border across the northern border , health authorities in the central us state of kansas confirmed two cases of swine flu on saturday , bringing the total number of cases in the united states to at least 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that swine flu will travel are being realized one of the victims was still ill while the other had recovered , kansas health authorities said .
one of the patients had recently traveled to mexico .
" both persons ... became ill with the same unique -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- strain of swine flu that has been identified in mexico , california and texas , " kansas officials said in a statement .
earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .
health officials sunday also confirmed that eight new york school students were diagnosed with a swine flu similar to the strain blamed for dozens of deaths in mexico .
about 100 students began feeling ill at a new york school last week and nine swabs were taken from them .
eight tests were positive , the city 's health department said .
however , the students only suffered mild symptoms and most were now recovering . nda / jam , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .

russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .

he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .

with five matches remaining , wolfsburg have 57 points , with hertha on 55 and bayern , stuttgart and hamburg on 54 .
cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .
" we had good chances which we did n't take and and that 's why we did n't win , " magath said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath 's side failed to score for the first time in 13 games wolfsburg were foiled several times by keeper gerhard tremmel who did well to keep out an early zvejezdan misimovic effort and pulled off another fine save when he thwarted cristian zaccardo almost immediately after rangelov 's goal .
brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .
" he stopped everything and played tremendously but our strikers did n't have their best day today , " magath said .
rangelov 's goal left wolfsburg looking desperate and they were caught out when dennis soerensen threaded a ball through to skela who worked some space before turning the ball past diego benaglio in goal .
title race wide open the defeat was a fillip for wolfsburg 's rivals including bayern munich who slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to schalke 04 on saturday .
hamburg also went down saturday in a 2-0 loss at borussia dortmund , while stuttgart defeated eintracht frankfurt and hertha were 1-0 winners on friday at hoffenheim .
cottbus are now out of the relegation zone , on 26 points , one ahead of bielefeld and two up on moenchengladbach , with karlsruhe two points further adrift in last place .
moenchengladbach took the lead against bielefeld through algerian striker karim matmour in the 13th minute , only for the visitors to level through robert tesche in the 32nd . nrt / md dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .

they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the ship ’ s captain , ciro pinto , the pirates attempted to board the ship by placing a ladder on the bow . however security personal on board returned fire , “ and when they saw we were shooting , they abandoned their effort and went away , ” pinto said . he reported light damage to the ship from bullets . the melody is owned by the italian company msc .

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .

" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .

while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .

26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .

earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .

students are required to take an ethics course and may take additional religion courses if they want .
had the referendum passed , students could have picked ethics or religion , which is the case in the rest of germany . berlin became the exception to the rule in 2006 after ethics classes became compulsory .
the change followed an " honor killing " of a turkish woman in 2005 by her brothers in berlin because her family disapproved of her western lifestyle . the referendum had been supported by german chancellor angela merkel , the churches and several prominent personalities .

students are required to take an ethics course and may take additional religion courses if they want .
had the referendum passed , students could have picked ethics or religion , which is the case in the rest of germany . berlin became the exception to the rule in 2006 after ethics classes became compulsory .
the change followed an " honor killing " of a turkish woman in 2005 by her brothers in berlin because her family disapproved of her western lifestyle . the referendum had been supported by german chancellor angela merkel , the churches and several prominent personalities .
proponents argued that due to the mandatory ethics classes , attendance was falling at optional religion courses in berlin schools . mz / jam , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cottbus moved out of the relegation zone , ahead of borussia moenchengladbach and arminia bielefeld who drew 1-1 .
wolfsburg were seeking a bundesliga record of 11 successive wins but could not break down a dogged cottbus side and failed to score for only the third time this season .
felix magath 's side were stunned in the 72nd minute when ilica iliev played a one-two with ervin skela on the left and crossed for dimitar rangelov to head in at the far post .
the home side put the game beyond reach when skela made it two with four minutes remaining as wolfsburg were caught on the break .

brazilian striker grafite , the league 's top scorer , was well shackled , but strike partner edin dzeko missed a good opportunity when he pulled a shot just wide before the interval and shot weakly from a good position after the break , again allowing tremmel to save .

students are required to take an ethics course and may take additional religion courses if they want .
had the referendum passed , students could have picked ethics or religion , which is the case in the rest of germany . berlin became the exception to the rule in 2006 after ethics classes became compulsory .
the change followed an " honor killing " of a turkish woman in 2005 by her brothers in berlin because her family disapproved of her western lifestyle . the referendum had been supported by german chancellor angela merkel , the churches and several prominent personalities .
proponents argued that due to the mandatory ethics classes , attendance was falling at optional religion courses in berlin schools . mz / jam , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.04.2009 mexico takes new swine flu precautions as pandemic concerns spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico has increased precautionary measures mexicans took new precautions sunday , apr .
26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .
jumping the border across the northern border , health authorities in the central us state of kansas confirmed two cases of swine flu on saturday , bringing the total number of cases in the united states to at least 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that swine flu will travel are being realized one of the victims was still ill while the other had recovered , kansas health authorities said .
one of the patients had recently traveled to mexico .
" both persons ... became ill with the same unique -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- strain of swine flu that has been identified in mexico , california and texas , " kansas officials said in a statement .
earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .
health officials sunday also confirmed that eight new york school students were diagnosed with a swine flu similar to the strain blamed for dozens of deaths in mexico .
about 100 students began feeling ill at a new york school last week and nine swabs were taken from them .
eight tests were positive , the city 's health department said .
however , the students only suffered mild symptoms and most were now recovering . nda / jam , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.04.2009 mexico takes new swine flu precautions as pandemic concerns spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico has increased precautionary measures mexicans took new precautions sunday , apr .
26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .
jumping the border across the northern border , health authorities in the central us state of kansas confirmed two cases of swine flu on saturday , bringing the total number of cases in the united states to at least 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that swine flu will travel are being realized one of the victims was still ill while the other had recovered , kansas health authorities said .
one of the patients had recently traveled to mexico .
" both persons ... became ill with the same unique -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- strain of swine flu that has been identified in mexico , california and texas , " kansas officials said in a statement .
earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .

he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority . " meanwhile , a party formed at the height of the economic collapse and which has pushed for democratic reforms , the civil movement , looked set to enter parliament , credited with 7.2 percent of votes . sje / md , reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.04.2009 mexico takes new swine flu precautions as pandemic concerns spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico has increased precautionary measures mexicans took new precautions sunday , apr .
26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .
jumping the border across the northern border , health authorities in the central us state of kansas confirmed two cases of swine flu on saturday , bringing the total number of cases in the united states to at least 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that swine flu will travel are being realized one of the victims was still ill while the other had recovered , kansas health authorities said .
one of the patients had recently traveled to mexico .
" both persons ... became ill with the same unique -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- strain of swine flu that has been identified in mexico , california and texas , " kansas officials said in a statement .
earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .
health officials sunday also confirmed that eight new york school students were diagnosed with a swine flu similar to the strain blamed for dozens of deaths in mexico .
about 100 students began feeling ill at a new york school last week and nine swabs were taken from them .
eight tests were positive , the city 's health department said .
however , the students only suffered mild symptoms and most were now recovering . nda / jam , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , amid fears that a new flu epidemic believed to have killed up to 81 people in the country could reach " pandemic " proportions and spread to the united states and worldwide . mexican health minister jose angel cordova raised the probable death toll from the new multi-strain swine flu in mexico to 81 , including 20 already confirmed .
earlier , mexican president felipe calderon published an order giving his government extraordinary powers to tackle the deadly outbreak , as at least two new cases were reported in the united states , bringing the total infected there to 10 .
" this virus has clearly a pandemic potential , " margaret chan , director general of the world health organization , said on saturday .
the geneva-based un agency branded the outbreak " a public health emergency of international concern , " following a meeting of its emergency committee .
in a statement it said it was recommending that all nations " intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . "
in mexico , 13 new suspect cases were reported in the past 24 hours and a total of 1,324 patients with flu symptoms were under investigation , health minister cordova said .
since april 13 , " there have been 81 registered deaths which are probably linked to the virus of which only 20 cases have virological checks , " cordova told a news conference after meeting with health officials from across the country .
the mexico government has upped emergency measures that were put into place only on friday .
officials have canceled hundreds of public events and closed schools for millions of students in and around the capital .
apart from the capital , four other deaths were reported in central , northwest and southern mexico .
mexico city authorities have said they had more than one million doses of suitable antiviral drugs in an urban area of some 20 million .
the government also assured citizens it had " sufficient " funds reaching $ 450 million to combat the epidemic .
jumping the border across the northern border , health authorities in the central us state of kansas confirmed two cases of swine flu on saturday , bringing the total number of cases in the united states to at least 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears that swine flu will travel are being realized one of the victims was still ill while the other had recovered , kansas health authorities said .
one of the patients had recently traveled to mexico .
" both persons ... became ill with the same unique -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- strain of swine flu that has been identified in mexico , california and texas , " kansas officials said in a statement .
earlier on saturday new york officials said eight to nine students at a new york city school were suspected of having swine flu , although test results are still pending .
" with infections in as many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said anne schuchat of the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- .
the cdc said some mexican victims had died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in texas and california .
dave daigle of the cdc said a bird flu strain , two swine flu strains and a human strain had combined for the first time .
" the most worrying fact is that it appears to transmit from human to human , " said who spokesman thomas abraham .
these features , along with the fact that young , healthy adults have fallen victim in mexico instead of the very old or very young , have given rise to fears of an epidemic or even a pandemic .
according to the who , pigs have already been factors in the appearance of two previously unknown diseases that gave rise to pandemics in the last century .
if a pig is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza virus , it can serve as a " mixing vessel " for the two viruses that could combine to create a new , more virulent strain .
travelers returning with symptoms meanwhile ten new zealand college students who tested positive for influenza on sunday , a day after returning from mexico , are likely to have swine flu , health minister tony ryall said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other countries will take similar precautions to those in mexico " ministry of health officials advise me there is no guarantee these students have swine influenza , but they consider it likely , " ryall told reporters .
" all precautions are being taken to allow for this .
however , i am also informed none of the affected patients are considered seriously ill , and most in fact seem to be on the road to recovery , " he added .
in france , health authorities have found two suspected cases of swine flu in travelers returning from mexico and others are expected to follow , the country 's top health official said in an interview sunday .
" we do have suspicions , but these have not been confirmed , about two people who have returned from mexico , " general health director didier houssin told le parisien newspaper .
" there will certainly not be a lack of other cases in the coming days because there have been a lot of flights and boat trips " from mexico , he added , saying that he " would not rule out that a sick person , and therefore potentially contagious , could enter france . "
elsewhere , a british airways steward admitted to hospital with " flu-like symptoms " after arriving on a flight from mexico city does not have swine flu , the hospital said sunday .
" i can confirm he does not have swine flu .
all the tests have come back negative , " a spokesman at northwick park hospital said .
a ba spokesman said saturday the man was on flight ba242 from mexico city which had landed at london 's main heathrow airport .
the health protection agency stressed that he was undergoing tests " as a precautionary measure . "
us public health emergency the white house said on sunday that the us now has 20 confirmed cases of swine flu in five states , including new york , california , texas , kansas and ohio .
the us has declared a public health emergency sunday in the wake of the outbreak and will screen visitors arriving from infected areas , homeland security secretary janet napolitano said .
the declaration will start the flow of aid to states and communities that might be affected by the outbreak .
health officials sunday also confirmed that eight new york school students were diagnosed with a swine flu similar to the strain blamed for dozens of deaths in mexico .
about 100 students began feeling ill at a new york school last week and nine swabs were taken from them .
eight tests were positive , the city 's health department said .
however , the students only suffered mild symptoms and most were now recovering . nda / jam , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority .

" we lost this time but we will win again later , " party leader bjarni benediktsson said , conceding defeat having garnered just 23.6 percent of votes , far below the conservatives ' previous all-time low of 27 percent in 1987 . prime minister johanna sigurdardottir of the pro-eu social democratic party will now have to try to reach an agreement with its eurosceptic coalition partner , the left green movement , on european union membership . the social democrats were credited with 30.3 percent of votes and the left greens with 21.7 percent , according to official estimates with 90 percent of ballots counted . those numbers would give the coalition an absolute majority of 52 percent , a first for a left-wing government . the independence party was in power in the early 1990s when the financial markets were deregulated , and has been held accountable for the current crisis which has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and their savings . benediktsson admitted he got the voters ' message . " it has been clear that we have lost trust and we are just beginning to gain that back , " he said . iceland was one of the most prosperous countries in the world until late last year , when the global financial crisis led to the collapse of its oversized financial sector and had a devastating impact . the state had to take control of the country 's three major banks in october , as the local currency , the icelandic krona , lost 44 percent of its value . unemployment , which was virtually non-existent before the crisis , is expected to hit 10 percent by the end of this year as the economy shrinks by 10 percent , and inflation is currently hovering around 15 percent . the country received a $ 2.1-billion -lrb- 1.58-billion-euro -rrb- bailout from the international monetary fund in november , and some early signs of a recovery have been observed . sigurdardottir is a fierce advocate of joining the european union quickly and adopting the euro , arguing that doing so would shelter the nordic island nation of 320,000 people from global turbulence . " if we apply immediately for eu membership we will be able to adopt the euro within four years , " she said saturday before polls closed , adding that iceland " already meets 70 to 75 percent of eu criteria . "
as the election results came in , she said : " this is a clear message that people want us to start thinking about the eu . " yet her coalition partners , the left greens , are opposed to eu membership . they have nonetheless insisted on the need for a debate on the issue which deeply divides iceland amid fears that brussels would interfere with its large fishing industry . the fishing sector - accounting for 36.6 percent of exports in 2008 , second only to the aluminium industry - is seen as crucial to iceland 's economic recovery . despite their opposing eu views , the social democrats and left greens insisted their coalition would continue , but they have not yet explained how they plan to overcome their differences . sigurdardottir said an absolute majority for her coalition , if confirmed , would be " historic " . " if this is the result , these will be historic elections , as this is the first time that leftist parties will hold a majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.04.2009 imf , world bank prepare global stimulus measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf and world bank seem to have found some consensus of stimulus the international monetary fund says all member nations have agreed on stimulus measures aimed at combating the global financial crisis and the need to clean up banks ' asset sheets . " everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .
world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .

" everybody is happy with what has been done on fiscal stimulus ... all agree on the absolute necessity of cleansing the financial system , " imf head dominique strauss-kahn said on saturday .
the imf chief said the spring meeting of the imf 's top steering committee in washington had made it clear that there was no longer any major disagreement over how to tackle the crisis .
as the magnitude of the worst global slump since the 1930s spread became clear throughout 2008 , various governments had taken different positions on how much money they should spend - and how much new debt they should create - to get their economies going again .
the united states advocated spending any amount necessary while europe , and especially germany , were reluctant to commit ever more funds , preferring to wait and evaluate the effectiveness of initial steps .
strauss-kahn said the imf had been right to stress the need to clear toxic assets from banks 's balance sheets , adding that there could be no recovery as long as banks shied away from lending .
differences now , he said , centered on what the exit strategies should be used over the next three or four years to break free of the crisis .
funding to be doubled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the imf is the prime institution for dealing finanical crisis strauss-kahn said saturday 's imf meeting , which picked up from the group of 20 london summit of developed and developing countries on april 2 , confirmed that the imf was now at the center of policy coordination on the crisis .
he noted positively broad agreement on supplying the imf with additional funds so that it can help poorer countries struggling in the crisis .
the meeting also raised the possibility that the imf would raise extra funds by selling bonds to member states .
" a key achievement of today 's meeting is ensuring the doubling of the fund 's loanable resources , " a statement by the imf 's international monetary and finance committee said .
the first stage will see an extra 250 billion dollars made available through a special facility to help " member countries with external financing needs , " followed by another 250 billion dollars , as agreed at the g20 summit .
democratic deficit us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he hoped finance ministers could make " substantial progress " towards the 500-billion-dollar mark , about two-thirds of which has been pledged to the imf so far .
geithner called on emerging countries to " demonstrate their growing role in the global economy " by loaning the rest .
china , brazil and other emerging powers are in talks to make loans , but continue to seek assurances that they will be given a greater role in imf decision-making in return .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega said the imf still had a long way to go before developing countries were well-represented and suggested a long-term increase in the imf 's funding " could limit the scope for and delay " those reforms .
" the imf repented from many of its past sins .
but it still has to address the original sin : its democratic deficit , " mantega said in a statement .
the us and europe , which together hold about half of the imf 's voting rights , have both said they are willing to give emerging powers more clout , but a review is only set to be completed in january 2011 .

world bank pledges to help developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the economic crisis is hitting developing countries hard meanwhile , the world bank on saturday launched a 41.5 billion euro -lrb- us $ 55 billion -rrb- infrastructure investment program as part of efforts to help developing countries weather the worst global slump in decades .
" as developing countries are facing the trials of the global economic crisis , it is vitally important that economic stimulus packages in the developed world are accompanied by support to those that can not afford multi-billion -lrb- dollar -rrb- bailouts , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement .
" a decline in infrastructure leaves weaker foundations for long-term economic growth that hits the poorest the hardest , " he said .
zoellick said two vehicles were being set up - its own infrastructure recovery and assets -lrb- infra -rrb- and an infrastructure crisis facility -lrb- icf -rrb- run by the world bank 's private sector arm , the international finance corp. bank officials said germany would provide 500 million euros for road-building and other infrastructure projects left in limbo because capital investment has dried up , while france pledged one billion euros for the icf .
while the assistance the world bank provides would be global in scope , africa is expected to see a large proportion of the investments , given the sizable needs on the continent .
many developing countries have complained that while they did not cause the global financial crisis , they are among the worst hit and least able to fight the impact on their vulnerable economies . sje , nda , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people are heading to the polls in the southern-russian town which host to the 2014 winter olympics .
it 's an election that is likely to be watched very closely by the kremlin and throughout russia . russian president dmitry medvedev has called the mayoral campaign sochi a " genuine political battle " and said it will enrich russian democracy .
but complains from candidates and ex-candidates about how the campaign is run are numerous .
the number of contenders has shrunk to six from 26 - in the early stages , candidates included a billionaire , a porn star and a ballerina .
some later withdrew voluntarily while others were banned from participating for technicalities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kremlin-backed anatoly pakhomov hopes take home the vote the new mayor 's five-year term will run through the olympics in february 2014 .
russian prime minister vladimir putin said he hoped the people of sochi will elect a " responsible , active , professionally capable and moral man . "
pro-kremlin candidate anatoly pakhomov , appointed as the town 's acting mayor in january , refuses to debate with his opponents .
those who want to debate have trouble getting the word out to some 400,000 residents of sochi says former deputy prime minister and now opposition candidate boris nemtsov .
" the authorities are deadly scared of me participating , " he said .
" they have completely blocked all tv channels .
none of the sochi tv channels is ready to give me an opportunity to set out my program , even for money . "
nemstov 's ally , former chess champion garry kasparov , has said the election could be a crack in putin 's tight grip on the country : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians were celebrating when sochi got the 2014 olympics " it 's a very dirty campaign , even by very low russian standards because there 's too much at stake , " he said .
" it 's not an election of boris nemtsov vs. unknown acting mayor .
it 's a fight literally against vladimir putin , because sochi is putin 's unofficial capital . "
last week , billionaire businessman alexander lebedev became another high-profile candidate to be removed from the running over an allegation that he had n't submitted the proper financial documents . lebedev has denied the charge .
lebedev 's supporters and some of his opponents have said he was eliminated because he was a threat to the kremlin candidate .
his spokesman said the polls showed him firmly occupying the second place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candidate boris nemtsov says the campaign was anything but free and fair boris nemtsov , communist candidate yury dzagania and billionaire alexander lebedev have all sued the pro-kremlin candidate and the acting mayor anatoli pakhomov for purported abuse of office during the election campaign .
they say his meetings with sochi residents are shown daily on television , his activities fill local newspapers and he spoke as a mayoral candidate during a recent interview with russia today television that apparently was filmed in his office in violation of election law .
pakhomov 's lawyer said later the mayor had used a public reception office decorated to look like his office in the interview - and denied any wrongdoing . anya ardayeva -lrb- ai , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one study found statins were linked to reduced risk of prostate cancer , and enlargement of the organ , which can cause urinary problems .
and a second study suggested the drugs may hinder the growth of prostate cancer by reducing inflammation .
the studies were presented to a conference of the american urological association .
it is too soon to say if the results of these studies could lead to a potential breakthrough in the use of statins john neate prostate cancer charity statins are currently used to lower cholesterol and help prevent heart attacks and strokes .
however , there is growing evidence that the drugs also prevent cancer cells from dividing , and may even cause some cancer cells to die .
worldwide , prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death .
the us mayo clinic followed 2,447 men aged 40 to 79 for nearly two decades .
they found men who took statins were three times less likely to develop prostate cancer than men who did not take the drugs .
they also found statin users were 57 % less likely to develop an enlarge prostate .
erectile dysfunction the mayo study also produced evidence that statins may protect men against erectile dysfunction .
this is likely to be side effect of controlling blood fats and cholesterol , high levels of which are known to increase the risk of problems getting an erection .
researcher dr jennifer st sauver said : " if you are taking a statin for a heart condition or to lower cholesterol , these studies suggest that statins could have other benefits .
" however , it is very clear we need more information before men are advised to start taking statins for their urological health . "
the second study , by duke university in north carolina , examined tumour samples from 254 men who had their prostate removed because of cancer .
they found inflammation levels among the samples were 72 % lower in men who had been taking statins .
it is thought that inflammation may fuel the growth of prostate cancer , and so lower levels may slow the speed of tumour development .
researcher dr lionel banez said : " previous studies have shown that men taking statins seem to have a lower incidence of advanced prostate cancer , but the mechanisms by which statins might be affecting the prostate remained largely unknown .
" we found men who were on statins had a 72 % reduction in risk for tumour inflammation , and we believe this might play a role in the connection between prostate cancer and statin use . "
john neate , chief executive of the prostate cancer charity , said the studies were interesting , but preliminary , and more work was required before firm conclusions could be drawn .
" it is too soon to say if the results of these studies could lead to a potential breakthrough in the use of statins to reduce the risk of prostate cancer or to slow its development .
" however , the results of the studies are certainly welcome and promising enough for research to continue . "
