" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2009 france defends plans to close migrants camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrants had been hoping calais would be just a stepping stone on the way to britain french officials have been explaining the decision to close down a provisional migrant camp near calais , known as the " the jungle " , despite un warnings of france 's duty towards people fleeing from conflict zones . vandalism , theft and human-trafficking were contributing factors in france 's decision to close down the makeshift camp , known as ' the jungle ' , near the channel port of calais within the next 10 days .
the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .

removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 17.09.2009 beleaguered chavez beefs up defenses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez spends more money on the military the venezuelan president 's revolution is under pressure from within and without : a renewed us presence is cause for concern while at home oil revenues are dwindling .
now he 's looking for new alliances - and weapons . hugo chavez ' recent whistle-stop tour around the world has left western governments guessing exactly what agenda the venezuelan president is pursuing .
there are a few things that all the destinations in his itinerary have in common : they are potential partners for new oil and gas alliances , and they do not get on too well with washington .
but the similarities stop here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .
in moscow he signed deals for russian tanks and missiles worth $ 2.2 billion and loosely agreed on nuclear cooperation .
for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

" in a free world , it ca n't be that we prescribe the size of a car , " she said , referring to the eu 's plans to penalize automakers that produce larger cars that are less fuel efficient .
" if the producers of large cars did not exist , the innovation of small ones could not be implemented so quickly . " though german car companies have are also producing electric and hybrid cars , they rely almost entirely on profits from standard gas models and aren ’ t looking to jeopardize the health of that sector of industry . “ germany is playing it smart with their multi facted approach , ” tim urquhart , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
“ they care deeply about green technology and electric cars and the whole bit , but they 're going to wait and see how much the trend catches on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.09.2009 irish women targeted in new eu reform treaty campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women were among the biggest groups of " no " voters ireland goes to the polls on oct .
2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .
this year the 24-hour news channel has been fined millions of dollars for violating recently enacted media laws .
it has also suffered tear-bomb attacks conducted by government sympathizers . stations like globovision that are slated to be shut down were broadcasting illegally and deserve to be closed , according to maria eugenia acero who works for the national radio international program . " they were illegal from the beginning , " she said .
" the frequencies they used did n't belong to them , so that space was simply made free for community radio stations or other stations to operate . " biased media landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez remains popular in venezuela much of the general public feel caught in the middle of a media war that 's left urban young people , like katiuska machado , a language student at venezuela 's universidad central , turning to the internet for independent information . " there is no way you can have a proper point of view on the radio , tv or newspaper , " he said .
" the whole media both sides are completely , completely partial . " national radio 's eugenia agreed there is a strong bias in venezuela ’ s media .
she said if opposition groups would stop trying to smear chavez , her station would n't be forced into lauding the government 's activities . " instead of informing , there is political campaigning going on from each side , " she said .
" national radio is simply counterattacking the editorial line of media that is very openly against the government .
we promote and inform the achievements the state has accomplished because it is not being broadcast elsewhere . " subtle rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-chavez demonstrators regularly take to the streets to protest radio station closures the antagonistic media landscape and a public with limited internet access leaves journalists trying to present balanced reporting largely without a means to spread information . while he is still highly popular in the country , journalists criticize that chavez 's policy to polish up his image hinders free reporting on critical issues in the country . venezuela 's journalist union leader , gregorio salazar said he has been fighting to provide people with fair information since chavez took office but often has to confront government agencies that would rather suppress media than support them . " authorities believe reporters are not informing when something bad happens because it 's our job , but because we journalists are politicians opposing the government , " he said .
" therefore we have to be confronted and somehow quieted . " although chavez 's speeches seem subtle and nuanced , the politics behind his rhetoric are clear . " the verbs are expressed by a militarized politician that feels a historical responsibility to be the anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal world leader , " salazar said . he warned that the international community can not afford to underestimate the influence of chavez 's use of the media or the government 's decision to close 29 more independent radio stations . " this is to be taken seriously both inside and outside venezuela , because they are not only words , they are concrete actions backed by venezuela ’ s immense amount of petrodollars , " he said . oscar schlenker editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he 's looking for new alliances - and weapons . hugo chavez ' recent whistle-stop tour around the world has left western governments guessing exactly what agenda the venezuelan president is pursuing .
there are a few things that all the destinations in his itinerary have in common : they are potential partners for new oil and gas alliances , and they do not get on too well with washington .
but the similarities stop here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .
in moscow he signed deals for russian tanks and missiles worth $ 2.2 billion and loosely agreed on nuclear cooperation .
for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

some asian car companies have heavily stepped up production of green cars and are on the cutting edge when it comes to green automotive technology .

among them are many rare copies , books that long have been out of print .
the people browsing the endless shelves for a hidden gem mostly want the real thing – a physical book .
for many , the hunt for the book is almost as important as the book itself .
" i would kill to find the book i want , " one of them jokes .
just down the road from de slegte bookshop , however , executives from google have been setting out their vision for an entirely different world .
a global empire of digitalized books that 's set to revolutionize the way we read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wíll reading a book made from paper soon be a thing of the past ?
" if i had my way in fifteen years from now , i should be able to go into a bookstore and buy any book ever published , any book ever printed , " says dan clancy , director of google books engineering .
" i should be able to buy it as a physical book or a digital book .
some people will physical books , some more digital books , others both . "
europe still needs to be won over dan clancy has been pushing hard to try to persuade weary european publishers and authors to sign up to the project .
in the united states , google books already has started working with libraries to digitalize millions of books and it looks set to have the exclusive right to sell out-of-print and out-of-copyright books – a global stock of up to nine million books .
but in europe there are big fears that google will just sling books online without prior agreement from european publishers .
" if a copy of a book published in europe finds its way to us libraries , google could scan that book even if the rights have not been sold in the us market , " says angela mills wade of the european publisher 's council .
" and this of course could possibly harm the publisher 's own opportunities to sell those rights . "
bernard gerard , director of the association of belgian publishers , says copyright infringement is the crucial issue at stake .
bildunterschrift : critics warn that the copyright infringments could hurt european publishers and authors " the problem is that it 's very complicated for any publisher to check which books google has already put online . "
he cautions that it would " take years " for google to meet european copyright demands – which vary in every country .
" the right to digitalize books ultimately rests with the editor , " gerard explains .
" no book should go online without a previous deal with the editor .
if that does n't happen , there is a clear violation . "
in countries like germany , spain , switzerland , there 's also lots of concern that google would have the global monopoly over books .
google has now made concessions to european publishers and despite the fears that it will become a big monopoly , many booksellers are enthusiastic .
several publishing houses and prestigious university libraries , such as gent and oxford say they already have registered an increased usage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of librarians from the us have offered their books for scanning " if you are a student and want to just read one chapter it 's far easier just to search online .
you do n't have to go to the library and spent ages looking for it . "
google 's dan clancy says . preserving cultural heritage booksellers are not necessarily opposed to the google project .
in many cases it 's a question of whether these books disappear from the cultural heritage altogether or whether they can be preserved in digital form .
at de sletge , koen bonnevie holds up a magnificent , gigantic leather-bound volume .
" this is a very rare edititon , " he says .
" it has engravings of the old testament and you will never be able to replicate this online .
there will always be people who want the book itself .
but when all copies are gone from the market , you will still be able to look at it online .
and i see this as a good thing . i think it will hurt us a little bit but not very much . "
after all , there probably will remain those bookworms scanning the shelves at de sletge .
" i love the touch , the feel and smell of a book , " one shopper says .
" it 's a passion .
going online could never be the same . "
so while google books really has a winning argument when it says it wants to preserve books for eternity by putting them online , it will never be able to replace the aura of a beautiful book .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .

for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .

the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .
this year the 24-hour news channel has been fined millions of dollars for violating recently enacted media laws .
it has also suffered tear-bomb attacks conducted by government sympathizers . stations like globovision that are slated to be shut down were broadcasting illegally and deserve to be closed , according to maria eugenia acero who works for the national radio international program . " they were illegal from the beginning , " she said .
" the frequencies they used did n't belong to them , so that space was simply made free for community radio stations or other stations to operate . " biased media landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez remains popular in venezuela much of the general public feel caught in the middle of a media war that 's left urban young people , like katiuska machado , a language student at venezuela 's universidad central , turning to the internet for independent information . " there is no way you can have a proper point of view on the radio , tv or newspaper , " he said .
" the whole media both sides are completely , completely partial . " national radio 's eugenia agreed there is a strong bias in venezuela ’ s media .
she said if opposition groups would stop trying to smear chavez , her station would n't be forced into lauding the government 's activities . " instead of informing , there is political campaigning going on from each side , " she said .
" national radio is simply counterattacking the editorial line of media that is very openly against the government .
we promote and inform the achievements the state has accomplished because it is not being broadcast elsewhere . " subtle rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-chavez demonstrators regularly take to the streets to protest radio station closures the antagonistic media landscape and a public with limited internet access leaves journalists trying to present balanced reporting largely without a means to spread information . while he is still highly popular in the country , journalists criticize that chavez 's policy to polish up his image hinders free reporting on critical issues in the country . venezuela 's journalist union leader , gregorio salazar said he has been fighting to provide people with fair information since chavez took office but often has to confront government agencies that would rather suppress media than support them . " authorities believe reporters are not informing when something bad happens because it 's our job , but because we journalists are politicians opposing the government , " he said .
" therefore we have to be confronted and somehow quieted . " although chavez 's speeches seem subtle and nuanced , the politics behind his rhetoric are clear . " the verbs are expressed by a militarized politician that feels a historical responsibility to be the anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal world leader , " salazar said . he warned that the international community can not afford to underestimate the influence of chavez 's use of the media or the government 's decision to close 29 more independent radio stations . " this is to be taken seriously both inside and outside venezuela , because they are not only words , they are concrete actions backed by venezuela ’ s immense amount of petrodollars , " he said . oscar schlenker editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .
this year the 24-hour news channel has been fined millions of dollars for violating recently enacted media laws .
it has also suffered tear-bomb attacks conducted by government sympathizers . stations like globovision that are slated to be shut down were broadcasting illegally and deserve to be closed , according to maria eugenia acero who works for the national radio international program . " they were illegal from the beginning , " she said .
" the frequencies they used did n't belong to them , so that space was simply made free for community radio stations or other stations to operate . " biased media landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez remains popular in venezuela much of the general public feel caught in the middle of a media war that 's left urban young people , like katiuska machado , a language student at venezuela 's universidad central , turning to the internet for independent information . " there is no way you can have a proper point of view on the radio , tv or newspaper , " he said .
" the whole media both sides are completely , completely partial . " national radio 's eugenia agreed there is a strong bias in venezuela ’ s media .
she said if opposition groups would stop trying to smear chavez , her station would n't be forced into lauding the government 's activities . " instead of informing , there is political campaigning going on from each side , " she said .
" national radio is simply counterattacking the editorial line of media that is very openly against the government .
we promote and inform the achievements the state has accomplished because it is not being broadcast elsewhere . " subtle rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-chavez demonstrators regularly take to the streets to protest radio station closures the antagonistic media landscape and a public with limited internet access leaves journalists trying to present balanced reporting largely without a means to spread information . while he is still highly popular in the country , journalists criticize that chavez 's policy to polish up his image hinders free reporting on critical issues in the country . venezuela 's journalist union leader , gregorio salazar said he has been fighting to provide people with fair information since chavez took office but often has to confront government agencies that would rather suppress media than support them . " authorities believe reporters are not informing when something bad happens because it 's our job , but because we journalists are politicians opposing the government , " he said .
" therefore we have to be confronted and somehow quieted . " although chavez 's speeches seem subtle and nuanced , the politics behind his rhetoric are clear . " the verbs are expressed by a militarized politician that feels a historical responsibility to be the anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal world leader , " salazar said . he warned that the international community can not afford to underestimate the influence of chavez 's use of the media or the government 's decision to close 29 more independent radio stations . " this is to be taken seriously both inside and outside venezuela , because they are not only words , they are concrete actions backed by venezuela ’ s immense amount of petrodollars , " he said . oscar schlenker editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.09.2009 irish women targeted in new eu reform treaty campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women were among the biggest groups of " no " voters ireland goes to the polls on oct .
2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .
this year the 24-hour news channel has been fined millions of dollars for violating recently enacted media laws .
it has also suffered tear-bomb attacks conducted by government sympathizers . stations like globovision that are slated to be shut down were broadcasting illegally and deserve to be closed , according to maria eugenia acero who works for the national radio international program . " they were illegal from the beginning , " she said .
" the frequencies they used did n't belong to them , so that space was simply made free for community radio stations or other stations to operate . " biased media landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez remains popular in venezuela much of the general public feel caught in the middle of a media war that 's left urban young people , like katiuska machado , a language student at venezuela 's universidad central , turning to the internet for independent information . " there is no way you can have a proper point of view on the radio , tv or newspaper , " he said .
" the whole media both sides are completely , completely partial . " national radio 's eugenia agreed there is a strong bias in venezuela ’ s media .
she said if opposition groups would stop trying to smear chavez , her station would n't be forced into lauding the government 's activities . " instead of informing , there is political campaigning going on from each side , " she said .
" national radio is simply counterattacking the editorial line of media that is very openly against the government .
we promote and inform the achievements the state has accomplished because it is not being broadcast elsewhere . " subtle rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-chavez demonstrators regularly take to the streets to protest radio station closures the antagonistic media landscape and a public with limited internet access leaves journalists trying to present balanced reporting largely without a means to spread information . while he is still highly popular in the country , journalists criticize that chavez 's policy to polish up his image hinders free reporting on critical issues in the country . venezuela 's journalist union leader , gregorio salazar said he has been fighting to provide people with fair information since chavez took office but often has to confront government agencies that would rather suppress media than support them . " authorities believe reporters are not informing when something bad happens because it 's our job , but because we journalists are politicians opposing the government , " he said .
" therefore we have to be confronted and somehow quieted . " although chavez 's speeches seem subtle and nuanced , the politics behind his rhetoric are clear . " the verbs are expressed by a militarized politician that feels a historical responsibility to be the anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal world leader , " salazar said . he warned that the international community can not afford to underestimate the influence of chavez 's use of the media or the government 's decision to close 29 more independent radio stations . " this is to be taken seriously both inside and outside venezuela , because they are not only words , they are concrete actions backed by venezuela ’ s immense amount of petrodollars , " he said . oscar schlenker editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.09.2009 irish women targeted in new eu reform treaty campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women were among the biggest groups of " no " voters ireland goes to the polls on oct .
2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.09.2009 german minister withholds controversial nuclear energy report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over nuclear energy has reignited in germany ahead of parliamentary elections a german minister is accused of withholding a potentially inflammatory report on nuclear energy .
the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 in the five years since its inception , the german book prize has helped german literature grab more of the international limelight .
it 's awarded to the year 's best german-language novel . the german book prize is considered to be the most prestigious award in the area of german literature .
jury members consisting of critics and bookshop owners delve through mountains of books , reading their way to the best .
six have now been short-listed for this year 's prize .
the winner , who will receive over 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- in prize money , will be announced on oct .
12 at the frankfurt book fair .
images of horror herta mueller is the most famous of those nominated on the shortlist , and her novel " atemschaukel " -lrb- everything i possess i carry with me -rrb- is the favorite .
the author , who has received numerous awards , writes about the horrors ethnic germans from romania experienced in a soviet work camp .
the book is based on interviews with some of the deported , including the poet oskar pastior .
he , like mueller , was a part of the german minority in romania , and they had planned to write the book together until pastior 's death in 2006 .
" atemschaukel " is a tender homage to the poet , and the most political book on this year 's shortlist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author herta mueller eifel blues until now , it 's been a smaller crowd that is familiar with norbert scheuer 's work , even though he 's written several novels and novellas .
all are based in the semi-mountainous region in west-central germany known as the eifel , where the author grew up .
" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .
he writes of shattered dreams and people around the age of 40 , who have not lived up to their potential .
there 's the scientist , who has failed in the big city , and now lives the dreary life of a lecturer in a village in the state of hesse .
or a dancer who ends up as a single mother overwhelmed with life .
as the title suggests , the paths of these two cross - at a three-day village festival - with an unimaginable force of attraction .
stephan thome is himself from hesse , but currently lives in taipei , and dares to take a literary look at his homeland .
love in the waiting loop rainer merkel 's novel " lichtjahre entfernt " -lrb- light years away -rrb- looks at " placing " or " positioning " memory .
in the book , a family therapist is on his way to the airport in new york and thinks about the past few years of his life .
he recalls affairs , adventures and his one true love , who seems to be light-years away .
in his third novel , merkel - who is a trained psychologist - plumbs the inner world of a man who is stingy both with money and with his feelings .
the body : a prison the most personal book on this year 's shortlist is " du stirbst nicht " -lrb- you 're not going to die -rrb- by katrin schmidt , who has primarily wowed audiences with the powerful use of language in her novels .
a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .
the book contains letters , newspaper reports and a series of monologues by a dog - all of which are linked together .
in the novel , paintings begin to talk and computers lose their minds .
the story also revolves around the lives of two young men , and graz , the capital of the austrian state of steiermark .
clemens j. setz received the ernst willner prize at the ingeborg bachmann literary competition in 2008 and is the only austrian candidate this year .
shattered dreams , personal retrospection and stories from the provinces are at the helm this year .
historical topics and political views play only a minor role .
the jury has placed many , largely unknown authors on the shortlist , whose literature is yet to be discovered , but is no less exciting for it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2009 france defends plans to close migrants camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrants had been hoping calais would be just a stepping stone on the way to britain french officials have been explaining the decision to close down a provisional migrant camp near calais , known as the " the jungle " , despite un warnings of france 's duty towards people fleeing from conflict zones . vandalism , theft and human-trafficking were contributing factors in france 's decision to close down the makeshift camp , known as ' the jungle ' , near the channel port of calais within the next 10 days .
the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.09.2009 german minister withholds controversial nuclear energy report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over nuclear energy has reignited in germany ahead of parliamentary elections a german minister is accused of withholding a potentially inflammatory report on nuclear energy .
the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2009 france defends plans to close migrants camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrants had been hoping calais would be just a stepping stone on the way to britain french officials have been explaining the decision to close down a provisional migrant camp near calais , known as the " the jungle " , despite un warnings of france 's duty towards people fleeing from conflict zones . vandalism , theft and human-trafficking were contributing factors in france 's decision to close down the makeshift camp , known as ' the jungle ' , near the channel port of calais within the next 10 days .
the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .

a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .
the book contains letters , newspaper reports and a series of monologues by a dog - all of which are linked together .
in the novel , paintings begin to talk and computers lose their minds .
the story also revolves around the lives of two young men , and graz , the capital of the austrian state of steiermark .
clemens j. setz received the ernst willner prize at the ingeborg bachmann literary competition in 2008 and is the only austrian candidate this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.09.2009 german minister withholds controversial nuclear energy report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over nuclear energy has reignited in germany ahead of parliamentary elections a german minister is accused of withholding a potentially inflammatory report on nuclear energy .
the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 17.09.2009 beleaguered chavez beefs up defenses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez spends more money on the military the venezuelan president 's revolution is under pressure from within and without : a renewed us presence is cause for concern while at home oil revenues are dwindling .
now he 's looking for new alliances - and weapons . hugo chavez ' recent whistle-stop tour around the world has left western governments guessing exactly what agenda the venezuelan president is pursuing .
there are a few things that all the destinations in his itinerary have in common : they are potential partners for new oil and gas alliances , and they do not get on too well with washington .
but the similarities stop here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .
in moscow he signed deals for russian tanks and missiles worth $ 2.2 billion and loosely agreed on nuclear cooperation .
for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

this is a question that seems to bother many people in south asia .
advertisements for skin lightening products are not helping : “ want a better job ?
want to find a decent husband ?
want to make your parents happy and proud ?
then use a fairness cream " , is what they profess .
whereas many white women go out of their way to get a tan , many south asian women think they would appear more attractive and confident if they were two shades lighter . when simi singh was growing up , her mother would forbid her from going outdoors .
she was not trying to keep her daughter out of trouble ; she was trying to keep her skin from getting dark , says simi singh , who often disobeyed the order .
now , the 25 year old software consultant regrets that her dark skin is not lighter .
but she believes there is a solution - fairness creams that she recently started using .
“ i am at a marriageable age , ” she says , “ and i need to look pretty .
in our indian context , only women who are fair are pretty .
i am a little dissatisfied with the skin tone i have right now .
i get more compliments and more desired looks by people if i look fairer .
there is a certain level of confidence in me . ”
advertising plugs fairness simi singh is not the only south asian woman to have an inferiority complex because of her complexion .
there are many others like her .
this is partly due to the increasing number of advertisements on television , in magazines and on huge roadside hoardings .
they are often variations on the same scene : a dashing beauty with flawless white skin claims that her goddess-like attractiveness is the result of the skin-lightening cream in her hand .
new brands of skin-lightening soaps , lotions , creams and talcum powder cram store shelves in rural and urban areas .
the tagline of “ fair and beautiful ” has even become a staple ingredient of matrimonial columns in indian newspapers .
dates back to colonialism but meera kanishk , a market researcher , explains that there are historical reasons for women wanting to be fairer : “ in india , the connotation of fair skin comes from the british .
white skin has a colonial connotation of power and superiority and is considered equal to attractiveness . ”
“ throughout asia dark skin is identified with the toil and sweat of hard labour in the fields , whereas fair skin is associated with an upscale life .
it all started as a matter of social hierarchy .
culturally now , people believe fair skin is associated with positive values that relate to class , lifestyle and beauty . ”
“ this is also true of men , ” adds kanishk .
“ cosmetic companies are now beginning to cater to them too , as well as to women . ”
side-effects do not deter everybody whatever their reason for using creams , not everybody is happy with the results .
some customers have complained about the side-effects .
sweeny virdi , a homemaker , says that her skin was ruined when she used a cream after being seduced by the tv adverts .
“ in 10 days , i had patches on my skin .
no way !
i would not use it and would not recommend that anyone use such fairness products . ”
but virdi seems to be an exception as the fairness creams gain in popularity .
whatever the reasons behind this fairness obsession - a quest for personal beauty or the reflection of deeper social problems - it is not likely to die soon .

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .

she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .

employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

this is a question that seems to bother many people in south asia .
advertisements for skin lightening products are not helping : “ want a better job ?
want to find a decent husband ?
want to make your parents happy and proud ?
then use a fairness cream " , is what they profess .
whereas many white women go out of their way to get a tan , many south asian women think they would appear more attractive and confident if they were two shades lighter . when simi singh was growing up , her mother would forbid her from going outdoors .
she was not trying to keep her daughter out of trouble ; she was trying to keep her skin from getting dark , says simi singh , who often disobeyed the order .
now , the 25 year old software consultant regrets that her dark skin is not lighter .
but she believes there is a solution - fairness creams that she recently started using .
“ i am at a marriageable age , ” she says , “ and i need to look pretty .
in our indian context , only women who are fair are pretty .
i am a little dissatisfied with the skin tone i have right now .
i get more compliments and more desired looks by people if i look fairer .

this is a question that seems to bother many people in south asia .
advertisements for skin lightening products are not helping : “ want a better job ?
want to find a decent husband ?
want to make your parents happy and proud ?
then use a fairness cream " , is what they profess .
whereas many white women go out of their way to get a tan , many south asian women think they would appear more attractive and confident if they were two shades lighter . when simi singh was growing up , her mother would forbid her from going outdoors .
she was not trying to keep her daughter out of trouble ; she was trying to keep her skin from getting dark , says simi singh , who often disobeyed the order .
now , the 25 year old software consultant regrets that her dark skin is not lighter .
but she believes there is a solution - fairness creams that she recently started using .
“ i am at a marriageable age , ” she says , “ and i need to look pretty .
in our indian context , only women who are fair are pretty .
i am a little dissatisfied with the skin tone i have right now .
i get more compliments and more desired looks by people if i look fairer .
there is a certain level of confidence in me . ”
advertising plugs fairness simi singh is not the only south asian woman to have an inferiority complex because of her complexion .
there are many others like her .
this is partly due to the increasing number of advertisements on television , in magazines and on huge roadside hoardings .
they are often variations on the same scene : a dashing beauty with flawless white skin claims that her goddess-like attractiveness is the result of the skin-lightening cream in her hand .
new brands of skin-lightening soaps , lotions , creams and talcum powder cram store shelves in rural and urban areas .
the tagline of “ fair and beautiful ” has even become a staple ingredient of matrimonial columns in indian newspapers .
dates back to colonialism but meera kanishk , a market researcher , explains that there are historical reasons for women wanting to be fairer : “ in india , the connotation of fair skin comes from the british .
white skin has a colonial connotation of power and superiority and is considered equal to attractiveness . ”
“ throughout asia dark skin is identified with the toil and sweat of hard labour in the fields , whereas fair skin is associated with an upscale life .
it all started as a matter of social hierarchy .
culturally now , people believe fair skin is associated with positive values that relate to class , lifestyle and beauty . ”
“ this is also true of men , ” adds kanishk .
“ cosmetic companies are now beginning to cater to them too , as well as to women . ”
side-effects do not deter everybody whatever their reason for using creams , not everybody is happy with the results .
some customers have complained about the side-effects .
sweeny virdi , a homemaker , says that her skin was ruined when she used a cream after being seduced by the tv adverts .
“ in 10 days , i had patches on my skin .
no way !
i would not use it and would not recommend that anyone use such fairness products . ”
but virdi seems to be an exception as the fairness creams gain in popularity .
whatever the reasons behind this fairness obsession - a quest for personal beauty or the reflection of deeper social problems - it is not likely to die soon .

this is a question that seems to bother many people in south asia .
advertisements for skin lightening products are not helping : “ want a better job ?
want to find a decent husband ?
want to make your parents happy and proud ?
then use a fairness cream " , is what they profess .
whereas many white women go out of their way to get a tan , many south asian women think they would appear more attractive and confident if they were two shades lighter . when simi singh was growing up , her mother would forbid her from going outdoors .
she was not trying to keep her daughter out of trouble ; she was trying to keep her skin from getting dark , says simi singh , who often disobeyed the order .
now , the 25 year old software consultant regrets that her dark skin is not lighter .
but she believes there is a solution - fairness creams that she recently started using .
“ i am at a marriageable age , ” she says , “ and i need to look pretty .
in our indian context , only women who are fair are pretty .
i am a little dissatisfied with the skin tone i have right now .
i get more compliments and more desired looks by people if i look fairer .
there is a certain level of confidence in me . ”
advertising plugs fairness simi singh is not the only south asian woman to have an inferiority complex because of her complexion .
there are many others like her .
this is partly due to the increasing number of advertisements on television , in magazines and on huge roadside hoardings .
they are often variations on the same scene : a dashing beauty with flawless white skin claims that her goddess-like attractiveness is the result of the skin-lightening cream in her hand .
new brands of skin-lightening soaps , lotions , creams and talcum powder cram store shelves in rural and urban areas .
the tagline of “ fair and beautiful ” has even become a staple ingredient of matrimonial columns in indian newspapers .
dates back to colonialism but meera kanishk , a market researcher , explains that there are historical reasons for women wanting to be fairer : “ in india , the connotation of fair skin comes from the british .
white skin has a colonial connotation of power and superiority and is considered equal to attractiveness . ”
“ throughout asia dark skin is identified with the toil and sweat of hard labour in the fields , whereas fair skin is associated with an upscale life .
it all started as a matter of social hierarchy .
culturally now , people believe fair skin is associated with positive values that relate to class , lifestyle and beauty . ”
“ this is also true of men , ” adds kanishk .
“ cosmetic companies are now beginning to cater to them too , as well as to women . ”
side-effects do not deter everybody whatever their reason for using creams , not everybody is happy with the results .
some customers have complained about the side-effects .
sweeny virdi , a homemaker , says that her skin was ruined when she used a cream after being seduced by the tv adverts .
“ in 10 days , i had patches on my skin .

" upper limits are one possible way to restrict bonus payments , " merkel said in an interview with the daily hamburger abendblatt . but she said this type of remuneration should be linked to the sustainable and real success of a business - and not to short-term profits . " what no one can understand is why those managers should be rewarded who work badly and then often call on the state to step in to save them . " going dutch ? dutch banks unilaterally imposed limits on bonuses and pay last week in what the netherlands ' finance minister said could be a model for the g-20 countries to follow . in its new banking code , bonuses will no longer be allowed to top annual salaries as of january and salaries themselves will have to be under a median figure for comparable jobs . jg / ap / afp editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he 's looking for new alliances - and weapons . hugo chavez ' recent whistle-stop tour around the world has left western governments guessing exactly what agenda the venezuelan president is pursuing .
there are a few things that all the destinations in his itinerary have in common : they are potential partners for new oil and gas alliances , and they do not get on too well with washington .
but the similarities stop here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .
in moscow he signed deals for russian tanks and missiles worth $ 2.2 billion and loosely agreed on nuclear cooperation .
for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .

from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he 's looking for new alliances - and weapons . hugo chavez ' recent whistle-stop tour around the world has left western governments guessing exactly what agenda the venezuelan president is pursuing .
there are a few things that all the destinations in his itinerary have in common : they are potential partners for new oil and gas alliances , and they do not get on too well with washington .
but the similarities stop here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .
in moscow he signed deals for russian tanks and missiles worth $ 2.2 billion and loosely agreed on nuclear cooperation .
for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2009 france defends plans to close migrants camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrants had been hoping calais would be just a stepping stone on the way to britain french officials have been explaining the decision to close down a provisional migrant camp near calais , known as the " the jungle " , despite un warnings of france 's duty towards people fleeing from conflict zones . vandalism , theft and human-trafficking were contributing factors in france 's decision to close down the makeshift camp , known as ' the jungle ' , near the channel port of calais within the next 10 days .
the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 17.09.2009 german book prize shortlist : of shattered dreams and sticky feelings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the winner is announced on oct .
12 in the five years since its inception , the german book prize has helped german literature grab more of the international limelight .
it 's awarded to the year 's best german-language novel . the german book prize is considered to be the most prestigious award in the area of german literature .
jury members consisting of critics and bookshop owners delve through mountains of books , reading their way to the best .
six have now been short-listed for this year 's prize .
the winner , who will receive over 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- in prize money , will be announced on oct .
12 at the frankfurt book fair .
images of horror herta mueller is the most famous of those nominated on the shortlist , and her novel " atemschaukel " -lrb- everything i possess i carry with me -rrb- is the favorite .
the author , who has received numerous awards , writes about the horrors ethnic germans from romania experienced in a soviet work camp .
the book is based on interviews with some of the deported , including the poet oskar pastior .
he , like mueller , was a part of the german minority in romania , and they had planned to write the book together until pastior 's death in 2006 .
" atemschaukel " is a tender homage to the poet , and the most political book on this year 's shortlist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author herta mueller eifel blues until now , it 's been a smaller crowd that is familiar with norbert scheuer 's work , even though he 's written several novels and novellas .
all are based in the semi-mountainous region in west-central germany known as the eifel , where the author grew up .
" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .
he writes of shattered dreams and people around the age of 40 , who have not lived up to their potential .
there 's the scientist , who has failed in the big city , and now lives the dreary life of a lecturer in a village in the state of hesse .
or a dancer who ends up as a single mother overwhelmed with life .
as the title suggests , the paths of these two cross - at a three-day village festival - with an unimaginable force of attraction .
stephan thome is himself from hesse , but currently lives in taipei , and dares to take a literary look at his homeland .
love in the waiting loop rainer merkel 's novel " lichtjahre entfernt " -lrb- light years away -rrb- looks at " placing " or " positioning " memory .
in the book , a family therapist is on his way to the airport in new york and thinks about the past few years of his life .
he recalls affairs , adventures and his one true love , who seems to be light-years away .
in his third novel , merkel - who is a trained psychologist - plumbs the inner world of a man who is stingy both with money and with his feelings .
the body : a prison the most personal book on this year 's shortlist is " du stirbst nicht " -lrb- you 're not going to die -rrb- by katrin schmidt , who has primarily wowed audiences with the powerful use of language in her novels .
a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .

12 in the five years since its inception , the german book prize has helped german literature grab more of the international limelight .
it 's awarded to the year 's best german-language novel . the german book prize is considered to be the most prestigious award in the area of german literature .
jury members consisting of critics and bookshop owners delve through mountains of books , reading their way to the best .
six have now been short-listed for this year 's prize .
the winner , who will receive over 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- in prize money , will be announced on oct .
12 at the frankfurt book fair .
images of horror herta mueller is the most famous of those nominated on the shortlist , and her novel " atemschaukel " -lrb- everything i possess i carry with me -rrb- is the favorite .
the author , who has received numerous awards , writes about the horrors ethnic germans from romania experienced in a soviet work camp .
the book is based on interviews with some of the deported , including the poet oskar pastior .
he , like mueller , was a part of the german minority in romania , and they had planned to write the book together until pastior 's death in 2006 .
" atemschaukel " is a tender homage to the poet , and the most political book on this year 's shortlist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author herta mueller eifel blues until now , it 's been a smaller crowd that is familiar with norbert scheuer 's work , even though he 's written several novels and novellas .
all are based in the semi-mountainous region in west-central germany known as the eifel , where the author grew up .
" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .
he writes of shattered dreams and people around the age of 40 , who have not lived up to their potential .
there 's the scientist , who has failed in the big city , and now lives the dreary life of a lecturer in a village in the state of hesse .
or a dancer who ends up as a single mother overwhelmed with life .
as the title suggests , the paths of these two cross - at a three-day village festival - with an unimaginable force of attraction .
stephan thome is himself from hesse , but currently lives in taipei , and dares to take a literary look at his homeland .
love in the waiting loop rainer merkel 's novel " lichtjahre entfernt " -lrb- light years away -rrb- looks at " placing " or " positioning " memory .
in the book , a family therapist is on his way to the airport in new york and thinks about the past few years of his life .
he recalls affairs , adventures and his one true love , who seems to be light-years away .
in his third novel , merkel - who is a trained psychologist - plumbs the inner world of a man who is stingy both with money and with his feelings .
the body : a prison the most personal book on this year 's shortlist is " du stirbst nicht " -lrb- you 're not going to die -rrb- by katrin schmidt , who has primarily wowed audiences with the powerful use of language in her novels .
a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .
the book contains letters , newspaper reports and a series of monologues by a dog - all of which are linked together .
in the novel , paintings begin to talk and computers lose their minds .
the story also revolves around the lives of two young men , and graz , the capital of the austrian state of steiermark .
clemens j. setz received the ernst willner prize at the ingeborg bachmann literary competition in 2008 and is the only austrian candidate this year .
shattered dreams , personal retrospection and stories from the provinces are at the helm this year .
historical topics and political views play only a minor role .
the jury has placed many , largely unknown authors on the shortlist , whose literature is yet to be discovered , but is no less exciting for it .

12 in the five years since its inception , the german book prize has helped german literature grab more of the international limelight .
it 's awarded to the year 's best german-language novel . the german book prize is considered to be the most prestigious award in the area of german literature .
jury members consisting of critics and bookshop owners delve through mountains of books , reading their way to the best .
six have now been short-listed for this year 's prize .
the winner , who will receive over 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- in prize money , will be announced on oct .
12 at the frankfurt book fair .
images of horror herta mueller is the most famous of those nominated on the shortlist , and her novel " atemschaukel " -lrb- everything i possess i carry with me -rrb- is the favorite .
the author , who has received numerous awards , writes about the horrors ethnic germans from romania experienced in a soviet work camp .
the book is based on interviews with some of the deported , including the poet oskar pastior .
he , like mueller , was a part of the german minority in romania , and they had planned to write the book together until pastior 's death in 2006 .
" atemschaukel " is a tender homage to the poet , and the most political book on this year 's shortlist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author herta mueller eifel blues until now , it 's been a smaller crowd that is familiar with norbert scheuer 's work , even though he 's written several novels and novellas .
all are based in the semi-mountainous region in west-central germany known as the eifel , where the author grew up .
" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .
he writes of shattered dreams and people around the age of 40 , who have not lived up to their potential .
there 's the scientist , who has failed in the big city , and now lives the dreary life of a lecturer in a village in the state of hesse .
or a dancer who ends up as a single mother overwhelmed with life .
as the title suggests , the paths of these two cross - at a three-day village festival - with an unimaginable force of attraction .
stephan thome is himself from hesse , but currently lives in taipei , and dares to take a literary look at his homeland .
love in the waiting loop rainer merkel 's novel " lichtjahre entfernt " -lrb- light years away -rrb- looks at " placing " or " positioning " memory .
in the book , a family therapist is on his way to the airport in new york and thinks about the past few years of his life .
he recalls affairs , adventures and his one true love , who seems to be light-years away .
in his third novel , merkel - who is a trained psychologist - plumbs the inner world of a man who is stingy both with money and with his feelings .
the body : a prison the most personal book on this year 's shortlist is " du stirbst nicht " -lrb- you 're not going to die -rrb- by katrin schmidt , who has primarily wowed audiences with the powerful use of language in her novels .
a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .
the book contains letters , newspaper reports and a series of monologues by a dog - all of which are linked together .
in the novel , paintings begin to talk and computers lose their minds .
the story also revolves around the lives of two young men , and graz , the capital of the austrian state of steiermark .
clemens j. setz received the ernst willner prize at the ingeborg bachmann literary competition in 2008 and is the only austrian candidate this year .
shattered dreams , personal retrospection and stories from the provinces are at the helm this year .
historical topics and political views play only a minor role .
the jury has placed many , largely unknown authors on the shortlist , whose literature is yet to be discovered , but is no less exciting for it .

the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.09.2009 german minister withholds controversial nuclear energy report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over nuclear energy has reignited in germany ahead of parliamentary elections a german minister is accused of withholding a potentially inflammatory report on nuclear energy .
the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 17.09.2009 european publishers not yet on the same page as google books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google aims to digitalize millions of books google books and most european countries are still at odds over whether the internet giant will be allowed to extend it 's business model from the us to europe - scanning books and selling them in digital form online . in the de slegte shop in brussels book-lovers find a full four storeys of second hand books .
among them are many rare copies , books that long have been out of print .
the people browsing the endless shelves for a hidden gem mostly want the real thing – a physical book .
for many , the hunt for the book is almost as important as the book itself .
" i would kill to find the book i want , " one of them jokes .
just down the road from de slegte bookshop , however , executives from google have been setting out their vision for an entirely different world .
a global empire of digitalized books that 's set to revolutionize the way we read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wíll reading a book made from paper soon be a thing of the past ?
" if i had my way in fifteen years from now , i should be able to go into a bookstore and buy any book ever published , any book ever printed , " says dan clancy , director of google books engineering .
" i should be able to buy it as a physical book or a digital book .
some people will physical books , some more digital books , others both . "
europe still needs to be won over dan clancy has been pushing hard to try to persuade weary european publishers and authors to sign up to the project .
in the united states , google books already has started working with libraries to digitalize millions of books and it looks set to have the exclusive right to sell out-of-print and out-of-copyright books – a global stock of up to nine million books .
but in europe there are big fears that google will just sling books online without prior agreement from european publishers .
" if a copy of a book published in europe finds its way to us libraries , google could scan that book even if the rights have not been sold in the us market , " says angela mills wade of the european publisher 's council .
" and this of course could possibly harm the publisher 's own opportunities to sell those rights . "
bernard gerard , director of the association of belgian publishers , says copyright infringement is the crucial issue at stake .
bildunterschrift : critics warn that the copyright infringments could hurt european publishers and authors " the problem is that it 's very complicated for any publisher to check which books google has already put online . "
he cautions that it would " take years " for google to meet european copyright demands – which vary in every country .
" the right to digitalize books ultimately rests with the editor , " gerard explains .
" no book should go online without a previous deal with the editor .
if that does n't happen , there is a clear violation . "
in countries like germany , spain , switzerland , there 's also lots of concern that google would have the global monopoly over books .
google has now made concessions to european publishers and despite the fears that it will become a big monopoly , many booksellers are enthusiastic .
several publishing houses and prestigious university libraries , such as gent and oxford say they already have registered an increased usage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of librarians from the us have offered their books for scanning " if you are a student and want to just read one chapter it 's far easier just to search online .
you do n't have to go to the library and spent ages looking for it . "
google 's dan clancy says . preserving cultural heritage booksellers are not necessarily opposed to the google project .
in many cases it 's a question of whether these books disappear from the cultural heritage altogether or whether they can be preserved in digital form .
at de sletge , koen bonnevie holds up a magnificent , gigantic leather-bound volume .
" this is a very rare edititon , " he says .
" it has engravings of the old testament and you will never be able to replicate this online .
there will always be people who want the book itself .
but when all copies are gone from the market , you will still be able to look at it online .
and i see this as a good thing . i think it will hurt us a little bit but not very much . "
after all , there probably will remain those bookworms scanning the shelves at de sletge .
" i love the touch , the feel and smell of a book , " one shopper says .
" it 's a passion .
going online could never be the same . "
so while google books really has a winning argument when it says it wants to preserve books for eternity by putting them online , it will never be able to replace the aura of a beautiful book .

the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this year , three ndp members were given suspended sentences for a similar offense . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is considering taking legal action against national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- spokesman klaus beier , after he made derogatory remarks about turkish-german player mesut özil during a television broadcast .
the far-right politician said the 20-year-old midfielder was n't a real german but only had german nationality on paper .
the remarks prompted nationwide condemnation .
" we are proud that mesut özil is a german national player , " dfb president theo zwanziger is quoted by the newspaper der tagespiegel as saying . " this is the kind of germany that the dfb wishes for : a free , tolerant and independent country , in which there is no place for nationalist thinking and racism , such as the npd idiots try to spread . "
zwanziger added that he would speak to mesut özil , who was born in germany to turkish parents , and his club , werder bremen , about what kind of legal action they might take against beier .
this is not the first time racially-motivated insults have been hurled at footballers by the npd .
in april , beier was given a seven-months suspended sentence for inciting racial hatred against patrick owomoyela , born to a nigerian father and a german mother .
two other high-ranking npd officials also received suspended sentences for the same offense. vj / dpa / ots editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 17.09.2009 european publishers not yet on the same page as google books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google aims to digitalize millions of books google books and most european countries are still at odds over whether the internet giant will be allowed to extend it 's business model from the us to europe - scanning books and selling them in digital form online . in the de slegte shop in brussels book-lovers find a full four storeys of second hand books .
among them are many rare copies , books that long have been out of print .
the people browsing the endless shelves for a hidden gem mostly want the real thing – a physical book .
for many , the hunt for the book is almost as important as the book itself .
" i would kill to find the book i want , " one of them jokes .
just down the road from de slegte bookshop , however , executives from google have been setting out their vision for an entirely different world .
a global empire of digitalized books that 's set to revolutionize the way we read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wíll reading a book made from paper soon be a thing of the past ?
" if i had my way in fifteen years from now , i should be able to go into a bookstore and buy any book ever published , any book ever printed , " says dan clancy , director of google books engineering .
" i should be able to buy it as a physical book or a digital book .
some people will physical books , some more digital books , others both . "
europe still needs to be won over dan clancy has been pushing hard to try to persuade weary european publishers and authors to sign up to the project .
in the united states , google books already has started working with libraries to digitalize millions of books and it looks set to have the exclusive right to sell out-of-print and out-of-copyright books – a global stock of up to nine million books .
but in europe there are big fears that google will just sling books online without prior agreement from european publishers .
" if a copy of a book published in europe finds its way to us libraries , google could scan that book even if the rights have not been sold in the us market , " says angela mills wade of the european publisher 's council .
" and this of course could possibly harm the publisher 's own opportunities to sell those rights . "
bernard gerard , director of the association of belgian publishers , says copyright infringement is the crucial issue at stake .
bildunterschrift : critics warn that the copyright infringments could hurt european publishers and authors " the problem is that it 's very complicated for any publisher to check which books google has already put online . "
he cautions that it would " take years " for google to meet european copyright demands – which vary in every country .
" the right to digitalize books ultimately rests with the editor , " gerard explains .
" no book should go online without a previous deal with the editor .
if that does n't happen , there is a clear violation . "
in countries like germany , spain , switzerland , there 's also lots of concern that google would have the global monopoly over books .
google has now made concessions to european publishers and despite the fears that it will become a big monopoly , many booksellers are enthusiastic .
several publishing houses and prestigious university libraries , such as gent and oxford say they already have registered an increased usage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of librarians from the us have offered their books for scanning " if you are a student and want to just read one chapter it 's far easier just to search online .
you do n't have to go to the library and spent ages looking for it . "
google 's dan clancy says . preserving cultural heritage booksellers are not necessarily opposed to the google project .
in many cases it 's a question of whether these books disappear from the cultural heritage altogether or whether they can be preserved in digital form .
at de sletge , koen bonnevie holds up a magnificent , gigantic leather-bound volume .
" this is a very rare edititon , " he says .
" it has engravings of the old testament and you will never be able to replicate this online .
there will always be people who want the book itself .
but when all copies are gone from the market , you will still be able to look at it online .
and i see this as a good thing . i think it will hurt us a little bit but not very much . "
after all , there probably will remain those bookworms scanning the shelves at de sletge .
" i love the touch , the feel and smell of a book , " one shopper says .
" it 's a passion .
going online could never be the same . "
so while google books really has a winning argument when it says it wants to preserve books for eternity by putting them online , it will never be able to replace the aura of a beautiful book .

earlier this year , three ndp members were given suspended sentences for a similar offense . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is considering taking legal action against national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- spokesman klaus beier , after he made derogatory remarks about turkish-german player mesut özil during a television broadcast .
the far-right politician said the 20-year-old midfielder was n't a real german but only had german nationality on paper .
the remarks prompted nationwide condemnation .
" we are proud that mesut özil is a german national player , " dfb president theo zwanziger is quoted by the newspaper der tagespiegel as saying . " this is the kind of germany that the dfb wishes for : a free , tolerant and independent country , in which there is no place for nationalist thinking and racism , such as the npd idiots try to spread . "
zwanziger added that he would speak to mesut özil , who was born in germany to turkish parents , and his club , werder bremen , about what kind of legal action they might take against beier .
this is not the first time racially-motivated insults have been hurled at footballers by the npd .
in april , beier was given a seven-months suspended sentence for inciting racial hatred against patrick owomoyela , born to a nigerian father and a german mother .
two other high-ranking npd officials also received suspended sentences for the same offense. vj / dpa / ots editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 17.09.2009 hugo chavez stifles independent venezuelan media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez 's critics accuse him of stifling independent media as venezuelan president hugo chavez announced a deal to drill for oil with china orinoco basin , his government pushed along plans to shutter 29 radio stations .
the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .
this year the 24-hour news channel has been fined millions of dollars for violating recently enacted media laws .
it has also suffered tear-bomb attacks conducted by government sympathizers . stations like globovision that are slated to be shut down were broadcasting illegally and deserve to be closed , according to maria eugenia acero who works for the national radio international program . " they were illegal from the beginning , " she said .
" the frequencies they used did n't belong to them , so that space was simply made free for community radio stations or other stations to operate . " biased media landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez remains popular in venezuela much of the general public feel caught in the middle of a media war that 's left urban young people , like katiuska machado , a language student at venezuela 's universidad central , turning to the internet for independent information . " there is no way you can have a proper point of view on the radio , tv or newspaper , " he said .
" the whole media both sides are completely , completely partial . " national radio 's eugenia agreed there is a strong bias in venezuela ’ s media .
she said if opposition groups would stop trying to smear chavez , her station would n't be forced into lauding the government 's activities . " instead of informing , there is political campaigning going on from each side , " she said .
" national radio is simply counterattacking the editorial line of media that is very openly against the government .
we promote and inform the achievements the state has accomplished because it is not being broadcast elsewhere . " subtle rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-chavez demonstrators regularly take to the streets to protest radio station closures the antagonistic media landscape and a public with limited internet access leaves journalists trying to present balanced reporting largely without a means to spread information . while he is still highly popular in the country , journalists criticize that chavez 's policy to polish up his image hinders free reporting on critical issues in the country . venezuela 's journalist union leader , gregorio salazar said he has been fighting to provide people with fair information since chavez took office but often has to confront government agencies that would rather suppress media than support them . " authorities believe reporters are not informing when something bad happens because it 's our job , but because we journalists are politicians opposing the government , " he said .
" therefore we have to be confronted and somehow quieted . " although chavez 's speeches seem subtle and nuanced , the politics behind his rhetoric are clear . " the verbs are expressed by a militarized politician that feels a historical responsibility to be the anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal world leader , " salazar said . he warned that the international community can not afford to underestimate the influence of chavez 's use of the media or the government 's decision to close 29 more independent radio stations . " this is to be taken seriously both inside and outside venezuela , because they are not only words , they are concrete actions backed by venezuela ’ s immense amount of petrodollars , " he said . oscar schlenker editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" authorities believe reporters are not informing when something bad happens because it 's our job , but because we journalists are politicians opposing the government , " he said .
" therefore we have to be confronted and somehow quieted . " although chavez 's speeches seem subtle and nuanced , the politics behind his rhetoric are clear . " the verbs are expressed by a militarized politician that feels a historical responsibility to be the anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal world leader , " salazar said . he warned that the international community can not afford to underestimate the influence of chavez 's use of the media or the government 's decision to close 29 more independent radio stations . " this is to be taken seriously both inside and outside venezuela , because they are not only words , they are concrete actions backed by venezuela ’ s immense amount of petrodollars , " he said . oscar schlenker editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel opened the frankfurt motor show thursday with a speech that looked to the future of transportation with electric and hybrid cars . merkel said widespread " green " car use was still some time off but that her government was making big investments into programs that would push green technology forward and make the eco-friendly cars more readily available on the market .

german chancellor angela merkel opened the frankfurt motor show thursday with a speech that looked to the future of transportation with electric and hybrid cars . merkel said widespread " green " car use was still some time off but that her government was making big investments into programs that would push green technology forward and make the eco-friendly cars more readily available on the market . " electro-mobility , electric and hybrid cars are very much the future , " she said in her opening speech at the show , which runs until september 27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a lot of interest in frankfurt in electric-powered cars , like this model from renault merkel also said she hopes germany will have 1 million electric cars on the road by 2020 , which means that it " it would really take another generation of car buyers " before this trend becomes mainstream here . merkel said she hopes germany will remain the automotive leader it is as the face of the industry changes .
some asian car companies have heavily stepped up production of green cars and are on the cutting edge when it comes to green automotive technology . " if asian markets take over the lead role and we lose the upper hand in standardization , then we will also lose he markets , " merkel said . merkel also had words of support for the general german car industry in general , which has recently found itself embroiled with the european commission over environmental standards . " in a free world , it ca n't be that we prescribe the size of a car , " she said , referring to the eu 's plans to penalize automakers that produce larger cars that are less fuel efficient .
" if the producers of large cars did not exist , the innovation of small ones could not be implemented so quickly . " though german car companies have are also producing electric and hybrid cars , they rely almost entirely on profits from standard gas models and aren ’ t looking to jeopardize the health of that sector of industry . “ germany is playing it smart with their multi facted approach , ” tim urquhart , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
“ they care deeply about green technology and electric cars and the whole bit , but they 're going to wait and see how much the trend catches on .
when it comes to all this new technology , no one knows what the end game is going to be .

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .
this year the 24-hour news channel has been fined millions of dollars for violating recently enacted media laws .
it has also suffered tear-bomb attacks conducted by government sympathizers . stations like globovision that are slated to be shut down were broadcasting illegally and deserve to be closed , according to maria eugenia acero who works for the national radio international program . " they were illegal from the beginning , " she said .
" the frequencies they used did n't belong to them , so that space was simply made free for community radio stations or other stations to operate . " biased media landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez remains popular in venezuela much of the general public feel caught in the middle of a media war that 's left urban young people , like katiuska machado , a language student at venezuela 's universidad central , turning to the internet for independent information . " there is no way you can have a proper point of view on the radio , tv or newspaper , " he said .
" the whole media both sides are completely , completely partial . " national radio 's eugenia agreed there is a strong bias in venezuela ’ s media .
she said if opposition groups would stop trying to smear chavez , her station would n't be forced into lauding the government 's activities . " instead of informing , there is political campaigning going on from each side , " she said .
" national radio is simply counterattacking the editorial line of media that is very openly against the government .
we promote and inform the achievements the state has accomplished because it is not being broadcast elsewhere . " subtle rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-chavez demonstrators regularly take to the streets to protest radio station closures the antagonistic media landscape and a public with limited internet access leaves journalists trying to present balanced reporting largely without a means to spread information . while he is still highly popular in the country , journalists criticize that chavez 's policy to polish up his image hinders free reporting on critical issues in the country . venezuela 's journalist union leader , gregorio salazar said he has been fighting to provide people with fair information since chavez took office but often has to confront government agencies that would rather suppress media than support them . " authorities believe reporters are not informing when something bad happens because it 's our job , but because we journalists are politicians opposing the government , " he said .
" therefore we have to be confronted and somehow quieted . " although chavez 's speeches seem subtle and nuanced , the politics behind his rhetoric are clear . " the verbs are expressed by a militarized politician that feels a historical responsibility to be the anti-imperialist and anti-neoliberal world leader , " salazar said . he warned that the international community can not afford to underestimate the influence of chavez 's use of the media or the government 's decision to close 29 more independent radio stations . " this is to be taken seriously both inside and outside venezuela , because they are not only words , they are concrete actions backed by venezuela ’ s immense amount of petrodollars , " he said . oscar schlenker editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel opened the frankfurt motor show thursday with a speech that looked to the future of transportation with electric and hybrid cars . merkel said widespread " green " car use was still some time off but that her government was making big investments into programs that would push green technology forward and make the eco-friendly cars more readily available on the market .

german chancellor angela merkel opened the frankfurt motor show thursday with a speech that looked to the future of transportation with electric and hybrid cars . merkel said widespread " green " car use was still some time off but that her government was making big investments into programs that would push green technology forward and make the eco-friendly cars more readily available on the market . " electro-mobility , electric and hybrid cars are very much the future , " she said in her opening speech at the show , which runs until september 27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a lot of interest in frankfurt in electric-powered cars , like this model from renault merkel also said she hopes germany will have 1 million electric cars on the road by 2020 , which means that it " it would really take another generation of car buyers " before this trend becomes mainstream here . merkel said she hopes germany will remain the automotive leader it is as the face of the industry changes .
some asian car companies have heavily stepped up production of green cars and are on the cutting edge when it comes to green automotive technology . " if asian markets take over the lead role and we lose the upper hand in standardization , then we will also lose he markets , " merkel said . merkel also had words of support for the general german car industry in general , which has recently found itself embroiled with the european commission over environmental standards . " in a free world , it ca n't be that we prescribe the size of a car , " she said , referring to the eu 's plans to penalize automakers that produce larger cars that are less fuel efficient .
" if the producers of large cars did not exist , the innovation of small ones could not be implemented so quickly . " though german car companies have are also producing electric and hybrid cars , they rely almost entirely on profits from standard gas models and aren ’ t looking to jeopardize the health of that sector of industry . “ germany is playing it smart with their multi facted approach , ” tim urquhart , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
“ they care deeply about green technology and electric cars and the whole bit , but they 're going to wait and see how much the trend catches on .

dairy farmers in germany and elsewhere say they need at least twice as much to make milk production sustainable . belgian farmers continued the european-wide protests on wednesday by spraying about three million liters -lrb- 790,000 gallons -rrb- of fresh milk onto their fields .
this followed a protest in germany on saturday , in which 7,000 liters of milk were dumped in front of agriculture ministry buildings in bonn , and a major strike in france last week , in which an estimated 40 percent of france 's 90,000 milk producers took part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers launched a protest against government inaction in berlin in may eu stop-gap to assuage the crisis , eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel intends to present aid measures to a committee in the european parliament in strasbourg on thursday .
the milk farmers blame over-production and a failure of the eu 's milk quota system for the plummeting prices .
the eu denies this , but remains divided on whether to liberalize or regulate the milk market . eu agriculture ministers agreed to raise the milk quotas by one percent a year , and scrapping them altogether in 2015 , but protest leaders said they wanted the eu to freeze these increases and create a pan-european institution to regulate the supply and demand of milk .
this body is to include representatives of politicians , farmers and consumers . demands go unheard " it is really sad that we have to throw away the milk , " romuald schaber , president of the european milk board , said at the demonstration in belgium where protesting farmers watched hundreds of tractors spew milk over fields .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .

removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .

the move comes after 34 others were recently shut down . from the time he was put in jail in 1992 for a failed coup attempt to the revolutionary campaign that saw him elected in 1990 , chavez has used the media to polish his image , according to his critics . venezuela 's media are required by law to air the president 's national addresses and messages , some of which can last for hours .
over the last 10 years chavez has interrupted more than 1,000 hours of regular programming to address the nation and has weekly radio and tv shows . according to william echeverria who heads venezuela 's journalists association , all independent media that is critical of the government is put under a microscope . " many journalistic media in different parts of venezuela prefer to negotiate with the government than cease to exist , " echeverria said , adding that this results in little room for dissidence in venezuela 's mass media . do as i say , or not at all the government has tagged echeverria as part of the opposition media that does not report the achievements of chavez 's leftist revolution .
but that 's a charge echeverria has disputed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez recently traveled europe , meeting politicians , including spain 's king " president chavez wishes that all the media speaks well of his political ideals , and that just can not be , " he said . echeverria also conducts a morning show in globovision , a staunch chavez critic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 17.09.2009 european publishers not yet on the same page as google books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google aims to digitalize millions of books google books and most european countries are still at odds over whether the internet giant will be allowed to extend it 's business model from the us to europe - scanning books and selling them in digital form online . in the de slegte shop in brussels book-lovers find a full four storeys of second hand books .
among them are many rare copies , books that long have been out of print .
the people browsing the endless shelves for a hidden gem mostly want the real thing – a physical book .
for many , the hunt for the book is almost as important as the book itself .
" i would kill to find the book i want , " one of them jokes .
just down the road from de slegte bookshop , however , executives from google have been setting out their vision for an entirely different world .
a global empire of digitalized books that 's set to revolutionize the way we read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wíll reading a book made from paper soon be a thing of the past ?
" if i had my way in fifteen years from now , i should be able to go into a bookstore and buy any book ever published , any book ever printed , " says dan clancy , director of google books engineering .
" i should be able to buy it as a physical book or a digital book .
some people will physical books , some more digital books , others both . "
europe still needs to be won over dan clancy has been pushing hard to try to persuade weary european publishers and authors to sign up to the project .
in the united states , google books already has started working with libraries to digitalize millions of books and it looks set to have the exclusive right to sell out-of-print and out-of-copyright books – a global stock of up to nine million books .
but in europe there are big fears that google will just sling books online without prior agreement from european publishers .
" if a copy of a book published in europe finds its way to us libraries , google could scan that book even if the rights have not been sold in the us market , " says angela mills wade of the european publisher 's council .
" and this of course could possibly harm the publisher 's own opportunities to sell those rights . "
bernard gerard , director of the association of belgian publishers , says copyright infringement is the crucial issue at stake .
bildunterschrift : critics warn that the copyright infringments could hurt european publishers and authors " the problem is that it 's very complicated for any publisher to check which books google has already put online . "
he cautions that it would " take years " for google to meet european copyright demands – which vary in every country .
" the right to digitalize books ultimately rests with the editor , " gerard explains .
" no book should go online without a previous deal with the editor .
if that does n't happen , there is a clear violation . "
in countries like germany , spain , switzerland , there 's also lots of concern that google would have the global monopoly over books .
google has now made concessions to european publishers and despite the fears that it will become a big monopoly , many booksellers are enthusiastic .
several publishing houses and prestigious university libraries , such as gent and oxford say they already have registered an increased usage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 17.09.2009 european publishers not yet on the same page as google books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google aims to digitalize millions of books google books and most european countries are still at odds over whether the internet giant will be allowed to extend it 's business model from the us to europe - scanning books and selling them in digital form online . in the de slegte shop in brussels book-lovers find a full four storeys of second hand books .
among them are many rare copies , books that long have been out of print .
the people browsing the endless shelves for a hidden gem mostly want the real thing – a physical book .
for many , the hunt for the book is almost as important as the book itself .
" i would kill to find the book i want , " one of them jokes .
just down the road from de slegte bookshop , however , executives from google have been setting out their vision for an entirely different world .
a global empire of digitalized books that 's set to revolutionize the way we read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wíll reading a book made from paper soon be a thing of the past ?
" if i had my way in fifteen years from now , i should be able to go into a bookstore and buy any book ever published , any book ever printed , " says dan clancy , director of google books engineering .
" i should be able to buy it as a physical book or a digital book .
some people will physical books , some more digital books , others both . "
europe still needs to be won over dan clancy has been pushing hard to try to persuade weary european publishers and authors to sign up to the project .
in the united states , google books already has started working with libraries to digitalize millions of books and it looks set to have the exclusive right to sell out-of-print and out-of-copyright books – a global stock of up to nine million books .
but in europe there are big fears that google will just sling books online without prior agreement from european publishers .
" if a copy of a book published in europe finds its way to us libraries , google could scan that book even if the rights have not been sold in the us market , " says angela mills wade of the european publisher 's council .
" and this of course could possibly harm the publisher 's own opportunities to sell those rights . "
bernard gerard , director of the association of belgian publishers , says copyright infringement is the crucial issue at stake .
bildunterschrift : critics warn that the copyright infringments could hurt european publishers and authors " the problem is that it 's very complicated for any publisher to check which books google has already put online . "
he cautions that it would " take years " for google to meet european copyright demands – which vary in every country .
" the right to digitalize books ultimately rests with the editor , " gerard explains .
" no book should go online without a previous deal with the editor .
if that does n't happen , there is a clear violation . "
in countries like germany , spain , switzerland , there 's also lots of concern that google would have the global monopoly over books .
google has now made concessions to european publishers and despite the fears that it will become a big monopoly , many booksellers are enthusiastic .
several publishing houses and prestigious university libraries , such as gent and oxford say they already have registered an increased usage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of librarians from the us have offered their books for scanning " if you are a student and want to just read one chapter it 's far easier just to search online .
you do n't have to go to the library and spent ages looking for it . "
google 's dan clancy says . preserving cultural heritage booksellers are not necessarily opposed to the google project .
in many cases it 's a question of whether these books disappear from the cultural heritage altogether or whether they can be preserved in digital form .
at de sletge , koen bonnevie holds up a magnificent , gigantic leather-bound volume .
" this is a very rare edititon , " he says .
" it has engravings of the old testament and you will never be able to replicate this online .
there will always be people who want the book itself .
but when all copies are gone from the market , you will still be able to look at it online .
and i see this as a good thing . i think it will hurt us a little bit but not very much . "
after all , there probably will remain those bookworms scanning the shelves at de sletge .
" i love the touch , the feel and smell of a book , " one shopper says .
" it 's a passion .
going online could never be the same . "
so while google books really has a winning argument when it says it wants to preserve books for eternity by putting them online , it will never be able to replace the aura of a beautiful book .

" the draft communique calls for an end to guaranteed bonuses with financial police given powers to cut payments when investments have failed to deliver and instruments to control high-risk speculations . french president nicolas sarkozy has been the most vociferous proponent of clamping down on bankers ' bonuses .

" upper limits are one possible way to restrict bonus payments , " merkel said in an interview with the daily hamburger abendblatt . but she said this type of remuneration should be linked to the sustainable and real success of a business - and not to short-term profits . " what no one can understand is why those managers should be rewarded who work badly and then often call on the state to step in to save them . " going dutch ? dutch banks unilaterally imposed limits on bonuses and pay last week in what the netherlands ' finance minister said could be a model for the g-20 countries to follow . in its new banking code , bonuses will no longer be allowed to top annual salaries as of january and salaries themselves will have to be under a median figure for comparable jobs . jg / ap / afp editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.09.2009 german minister withholds controversial nuclear energy report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over nuclear energy has reignited in germany ahead of parliamentary elections a german minister is accused of withholding a potentially inflammatory report on nuclear energy .
the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2009 france defends plans to close migrants camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrants had been hoping calais would be just a stepping stone on the way to britain french officials have been explaining the decision to close down a provisional migrant camp near calais , known as the " the jungle " , despite un warnings of france 's duty towards people fleeing from conflict zones . vandalism , theft and human-trafficking were contributing factors in france 's decision to close down the makeshift camp , known as ' the jungle ' , near the channel port of calais within the next 10 days .
the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's awarded to the year 's best german-language novel . the german book prize is considered to be the most prestigious award in the area of german literature .
jury members consisting of critics and bookshop owners delve through mountains of books , reading their way to the best .

the winner , who will receive over 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- in prize money , will be announced on oct .
12 at the frankfurt book fair .
images of horror herta mueller is the most famous of those nominated on the shortlist , and her novel " atemschaukel " -lrb- everything i possess i carry with me -rrb- is the favorite .
the author , who has received numerous awards , writes about the horrors ethnic germans from romania experienced in a soviet work camp .
the book is based on interviews with some of the deported , including the poet oskar pastior .
he , like mueller , was a part of the german minority in romania , and they had planned to write the book together until pastior 's death in 2006 .
" atemschaukel " is a tender homage to the poet , and the most political book on this year 's shortlist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author herta mueller eifel blues until now , it 's been a smaller crowd that is familiar with norbert scheuer 's work , even though he 's written several novels and novellas .
all are based in the semi-mountainous region in west-central germany known as the eifel , where the author grew up .
" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .
he writes of shattered dreams and people around the age of 40 , who have not lived up to their potential .
there 's the scientist , who has failed in the big city , and now lives the dreary life of a lecturer in a village in the state of hesse .
or a dancer who ends up as a single mother overwhelmed with life .
as the title suggests , the paths of these two cross - at a three-day village festival - with an unimaginable force of attraction .
stephan thome is himself from hesse , but currently lives in taipei , and dares to take a literary look at his homeland .
love in the waiting loop rainer merkel 's novel " lichtjahre entfernt " -lrb- light years away -rrb- looks at " placing " or " positioning " memory .
in the book , a family therapist is on his way to the airport in new york and thinks about the past few years of his life .
he recalls affairs , adventures and his one true love , who seems to be light-years away .
in his third novel , merkel - who is a trained psychologist - plumbs the inner world of a man who is stingy both with money and with his feelings .
the body : a prison the most personal book on this year 's shortlist is " du stirbst nicht " -lrb- you 're not going to die -rrb- by katrin schmidt , who has primarily wowed audiences with the powerful use of language in her novels .
a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .
the book contains letters , newspaper reports and a series of monologues by a dog - all of which are linked together .
in the novel , paintings begin to talk and computers lose their minds .
the story also revolves around the lives of two young men , and graz , the capital of the austrian state of steiermark .
clemens j. setz received the ernst willner prize at the ingeborg bachmann literary competition in 2008 and is the only austrian candidate this year .
shattered dreams , personal retrospection and stories from the provinces are at the helm this year .
historical topics and political views play only a minor role .
the jury has placed many , largely unknown authors on the shortlist , whose literature is yet to be discovered , but is no less exciting for it .

12 in the five years since its inception , the german book prize has helped german literature grab more of the international limelight .
it 's awarded to the year 's best german-language novel . the german book prize is considered to be the most prestigious award in the area of german literature .
jury members consisting of critics and bookshop owners delve through mountains of books , reading their way to the best .
six have now been short-listed for this year 's prize .
the winner , who will receive over 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- in prize money , will be announced on oct .
12 at the frankfurt book fair .
images of horror herta mueller is the most famous of those nominated on the shortlist , and her novel " atemschaukel " -lrb- everything i possess i carry with me -rrb- is the favorite .
the author , who has received numerous awards , writes about the horrors ethnic germans from romania experienced in a soviet work camp .
the book is based on interviews with some of the deported , including the poet oskar pastior .
he , like mueller , was a part of the german minority in romania , and they had planned to write the book together until pastior 's death in 2006 .
" atemschaukel " is a tender homage to the poet , and the most political book on this year 's shortlist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author herta mueller eifel blues until now , it 's been a smaller crowd that is familiar with norbert scheuer 's work , even though he 's written several novels and novellas .
all are based in the semi-mountainous region in west-central germany known as the eifel , where the author grew up .
" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .
he writes of shattered dreams and people around the age of 40 , who have not lived up to their potential .
there 's the scientist , who has failed in the big city , and now lives the dreary life of a lecturer in a village in the state of hesse .
or a dancer who ends up as a single mother overwhelmed with life .
as the title suggests , the paths of these two cross - at a three-day village festival - with an unimaginable force of attraction .
stephan thome is himself from hesse , but currently lives in taipei , and dares to take a literary look at his homeland .
love in the waiting loop rainer merkel 's novel " lichtjahre entfernt " -lrb- light years away -rrb- looks at " placing " or " positioning " memory .
in the book , a family therapist is on his way to the airport in new york and thinks about the past few years of his life .
he recalls affairs , adventures and his one true love , who seems to be light-years away .
in his third novel , merkel - who is a trained psychologist - plumbs the inner world of a man who is stingy both with money and with his feelings .
the body : a prison the most personal book on this year 's shortlist is " du stirbst nicht " -lrb- you 're not going to die -rrb- by katrin schmidt , who has primarily wowed audiences with the powerful use of language in her novels .
a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .
the book contains letters , newspaper reports and a series of monologues by a dog - all of which are linked together .
in the novel , paintings begin to talk and computers lose their minds .
the story also revolves around the lives of two young men , and graz , the capital of the austrian state of steiermark .
clemens j. setz received the ernst willner prize at the ingeborg bachmann literary competition in 2008 and is the only austrian candidate this year .
shattered dreams , personal retrospection and stories from the provinces are at the helm this year .
historical topics and political views play only a minor role .
the jury has placed many , largely unknown authors on the shortlist , whose literature is yet to be discovered , but is no less exciting for it .

the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this year , three ndp members were given suspended sentences for a similar offense . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is considering taking legal action against national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- spokesman klaus beier , after he made derogatory remarks about turkish-german player mesut özil during a television broadcast .
the far-right politician said the 20-year-old midfielder was n't a real german but only had german nationality on paper .
the remarks prompted nationwide condemnation .
" we are proud that mesut özil is a german national player , " dfb president theo zwanziger is quoted by the newspaper der tagespiegel as saying . " this is the kind of germany that the dfb wishes for : a free , tolerant and independent country , in which there is no place for nationalist thinking and racism , such as the npd idiots try to spread . "
zwanziger added that he would speak to mesut özil , who was born in germany to turkish parents , and his club , werder bremen , about what kind of legal action they might take against beier .
this is not the first time racially-motivated insults have been hurled at footballers by the npd .
in april , beier was given a seven-months suspended sentence for inciting racial hatred against patrick owomoyela , born to a nigerian father and a german mother .

earlier this year , three ndp members were given suspended sentences for a similar offense . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is considering taking legal action against national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- spokesman klaus beier , after he made derogatory remarks about turkish-german player mesut özil during a television broadcast .
the far-right politician said the 20-year-old midfielder was n't a real german but only had german nationality on paper .
the remarks prompted nationwide condemnation .
" we are proud that mesut özil is a german national player , " dfb president theo zwanziger is quoted by the newspaper der tagespiegel as saying . " this is the kind of germany that the dfb wishes for : a free , tolerant and independent country , in which there is no place for nationalist thinking and racism , such as the npd idiots try to spread .

the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .

the debate over nuclear energy has become a politically sensitive issue ahead of the september 27 elections . german education and research minister , annette schavan , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , has been keeping a controversial study on nuclear energy under wraps , with no plans to release it until after germany 's parliamentary elections , according to the financial times deutschland .
with less than two weeks to go before the election , the issue of nuclear energy is now well in the campaign spotlight .
the minister 's spokesperson , elmar koenig , played down the importance of the document , saying that it was n't a " study " per se , but rather a list of " possible scenarios " for future energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report schavan is accused of keeping secret was finished in june .
in 2002 , the german government under social democrat chancellor gerhard schroeder had approved a plan to phase out nuclear reactors by 2020 , but merkel 's christian democrats , concerned about dwindling energy supplies , high oil prices , and global warming , have sought to extend that deadline .
in a recent television debate , merkel called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " .
and the scientists who contributed to the report seem to agree .
the paper entitled , " concept for an integrated energy research program for germany " , compiled by one hundred scientists , advocates an extension of the use of nuclear reactors in germany , as well as the application of new technology currently used in the us , britain , and france .
the report , which was completed in june , also proposes scouting out another location for nuclear waste deposits to replace gorleben .
the controversial radioactive waste disposal facility in lower saxony has been a popular meeting spot for anti-nuclear protestors since the 1970 's when the oil crisis gave nuclear power a major boost in germany .
the chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe in 1986 , however , heralded a shift in attitudes toward nuclear energy .
and in recent years , a series of technical mishaps at nuclear power plants around the country has further increased anxieties about their safety .
scientists writing in the report acknowledge the risks involved with nuclear energy , but emphasize the cheap cost and ability to cut co2 emissions . vj / dpa / afp / ft deutschland editor : susan houlton susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version .

" " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe .

he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 17.09.2009 beleaguered chavez beefs up defenses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez spends more money on the military the venezuelan president 's revolution is under pressure from within and without : a renewed us presence is cause for concern while at home oil revenues are dwindling .
now he 's looking for new alliances - and weapons . hugo chavez ' recent whistle-stop tour around the world has left western governments guessing exactly what agenda the venezuelan president is pursuing .
there are a few things that all the destinations in his itinerary have in common : they are potential partners for new oil and gas alliances , and they do not get on too well with washington .
but the similarities stop here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .
in moscow he signed deals for russian tanks and missiles worth $ 2.2 billion and loosely agreed on nuclear cooperation .
for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .
despite being the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world , his government has found it difficult to influence the oil price , which in no small part is determined by political decisions taken by opec .
chavez ' attempts to forge new oil and gas alliances , if successful , could present opec with a serious challenge .

but the similarities stop here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez ordered more than 90 tanks from russia last week 's talks with the russian prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev presented a culmination of chavez ' latest bid to strengthen new alliances .
in moscow he signed deals for russian tanks and missiles worth $ 2.2 billion and loosely agreed on nuclear cooperation .
for his plan to build a " nuclear village " venezuela 's president also enlisted the support of iran , which he had visited days earlier .
iran in turn provided chavez ' with a good platform for his anti-american rhetoric .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and chavez pledged to back revolutionary nations and form anti-imperialist fronts , the official irna news agency reported .
that theme had already surfaced earlier on chavez ' first stop-over when he joined libya 's controversial " revolutionary " leader moammar gadhafi in celebrating his 40th year in power .
military spending spree causes worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rare picture : venezuelas chavez -lrb- l . -rrb- and colombia 's president uribe are not the best of friends but it is the venezuelan president 's military spending spree that has prompted the most immediate responses from the country 's neighbors in latin america and the us .
on wednesday mexico warned of a new arms build up in latin america .
earlier this week the us had criticized venezuela for setting off a new arms race .
after years of latin american military budgets broadly in decline , it is true that the trend has reversed .
but just who is to blame for driving the new arms build up is far less clear , said andreas boeckh , who is professor of latin american politics at tübingen university .
" colombia 's decision to let its us-allies open up new bases on its territory has rekindled old fears of military domination across the continent not just in venezuela , " he said , adding that in venezuela 's case the country 's long-running confrontation with colombia explains chavez ' particularly strong opposition .
more transparency needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers destroy drugs .
the us maintains it 's the main reason for supporting colombia on tuesday the 12 members of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- met in a bid to defuse the tensions raised by washington 's expanded military presence in the region .
the meeting also discussed the venezuelan arms deal with russia but ended in deadlock .
colombia , which has received nearly six billion dollars in mostly military aid from the united states over the last ten years , has rejected demands that it give its neighbors legally binding guarantees that the us military will not operate outside colombian territory .
several nations , including venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , brazil and argentina questioned washington 's motives , saying the us military deployment would be suspiciously large for the stated purpose of fighting colombian drug traffickers and rebels .
more than backtracking on individual decisions , " the one thing that is urgently necessary is to be open about them , " said carina solmirano , an expert on latin american security policy at the stockholm international peace research institute .
colombia as well as venezuela need to be transparent about the dealings they have with the us and russia respectively , she said , adding that this also holds true for the us .
but there may be another problem .
there is a lack of real dialogue , " venezuela interprets colombia 's actions the way it wants and colombia does likewise . "
the misunderstandings , in other words , are deliberate .
domestic problems at the core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these farc rebels have surrendered but their group fights on that is because domestic problems are driving the confrontation , too .
colombia 's center-right president alvaro uribe accuses venezuela of supporting the left-wing farc rebels in colombia , which continue to fight his government .
at home chavez is also facing political problems , said tübingen university 's andreas boeckh .
" chavez ' state apparatus has proved incapable of implementing or running his socialist project . "
declining oil revenues have also put the brakes on the bolivarian revolution .
oil exports account for half of the venezuelan government 's income , reports the council on foreign relations .
but world market oil prices have dropped by half since reaching a historic peak in summer 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower oil prices have reduced the government 's income when domestic trouble looms , targeting external enemies is a common way of trying to drum up support at home , explains boeckh .
from caracas ' vantage , " colombia 's decision to host the us military came just at the right time . "
but in the long term the venezuelan president may eye greater control over the oil price itself in order to shore up his revolution .

among them are many rare copies , books that long have been out of print .
the people browsing the endless shelves for a hidden gem mostly want the real thing – a physical book .
for many , the hunt for the book is almost as important as the book itself .
" i would kill to find the book i want , " one of them jokes .
just down the road from de slegte bookshop , however , executives from google have been setting out their vision for an entirely different world .
a global empire of digitalized books that 's set to revolutionize the way we read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wíll reading a book made from paper soon be a thing of the past ?
" if i had my way in fifteen years from now , i should be able to go into a bookstore and buy any book ever published , any book ever printed , " says dan clancy , director of google books engineering .
" i should be able to buy it as a physical book or a digital book .
some people will physical books , some more digital books , others both . "
europe still needs to be won over dan clancy has been pushing hard to try to persuade weary european publishers and authors to sign up to the project .
in the united states , google books already has started working with libraries to digitalize millions of books and it looks set to have the exclusive right to sell out-of-print and out-of-copyright books – a global stock of up to nine million books .
but in europe there are big fears that google will just sling books online without prior agreement from european publishers .
" if a copy of a book published in europe finds its way to us libraries , google could scan that book even if the rights have not been sold in the us market , " says angela mills wade of the european publisher 's council .
" and this of course could possibly harm the publisher 's own opportunities to sell those rights . "
bernard gerard , director of the association of belgian publishers , says copyright infringement is the crucial issue at stake .
bildunterschrift : critics warn that the copyright infringments could hurt european publishers and authors " the problem is that it 's very complicated for any publisher to check which books google has already put online . "
he cautions that it would " take years " for google to meet european copyright demands – which vary in every country .
" the right to digitalize books ultimately rests with the editor , " gerard explains .
" no book should go online without a previous deal with the editor .
if that does n't happen , there is a clear violation . "
in countries like germany , spain , switzerland , there 's also lots of concern that google would have the global monopoly over books .
google has now made concessions to european publishers and despite the fears that it will become a big monopoly , many booksellers are enthusiastic .
several publishing houses and prestigious university libraries , such as gent and oxford say they already have registered an increased usage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of librarians from the us have offered their books for scanning " if you are a student and want to just read one chapter it 's far easier just to search online .
you do n't have to go to the library and spent ages looking for it . "
google 's dan clancy says . preserving cultural heritage booksellers are not necessarily opposed to the google project .
in many cases it 's a question of whether these books disappear from the cultural heritage altogether or whether they can be preserved in digital form .
at de sletge , koen bonnevie holds up a magnificent , gigantic leather-bound volume .
" this is a very rare edititon , " he says .
" it has engravings of the old testament and you will never be able to replicate this online .
there will always be people who want the book itself .
but when all copies are gone from the market , you will still be able to look at it online .
and i see this as a good thing . i think it will hurt us a little bit but not very much . "
after all , there probably will remain those bookworms scanning the shelves at de sletge .
" i love the touch , the feel and smell of a book , " one shopper says .
" it 's a passion .
going online could never be the same . "
so while google books really has a winning argument when it says it wants to preserve books for eternity by putting them online , it will never be able to replace the aura of a beautiful book .

german chancellor angela merkel opened the frankfurt motor show thursday with a speech that looked to the future of transportation with electric and hybrid cars . merkel said widespread " green " car use was still some time off but that her government was making big investments into programs that would push green technology forward and make the eco-friendly cars more readily available on the market .

some asian car companies have heavily stepped up production of green cars and are on the cutting edge when it comes to green automotive technology . " if asian markets take over the lead role and we lose the upper hand in standardization , then we will also lose he markets , " merkel said . merkel also had words of support for the general german car industry in general , which has recently found itself embroiled with the european commission over environmental standards . " in a free world , it ca n't be that we prescribe the size of a car , " she said , referring to the eu 's plans to penalize automakers that produce larger cars that are less fuel efficient .

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" us president barack obama called me shortly after midnight to tell me his government was giving up its intention to build a radar base on czech soil , " fischer said thursday . the polish foreign ministry said the white house had informed warsaw that obama would be making a public announcement later on thursday . contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato already operates radar in the czech republic the missile shield has been a bone of contention between washington and moscow , since it was first proposed by former us president george w. bush .
while the us has insisted that the shield would protect against iranian long-range missiles , russia has seen the project as threatening its security .
the plans have also caused considerable irritation between eastern and western european countries , which have been unable to agree on the viability and necessity of the system . the wall street journal , which broke the story , said obama ordered a 60-day review of the bush administration ’ s plan .
the findings are expected to be completed as early as next week , according to the journal report . the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff , admiral mike mullen , told the associated press that the administration was " very very , close " to the end of its review . concern remains about iranian missiles paul beaver , a british defense analyst , told deutsche welle that the decision was a " recommendation to remove the missile defense shield in the gold-plated version . " " but we should not forget , " he said " that there is still real concern in europe about what iran might be doing with missiles in the future and what might happen if north korea gets an intercontinental ballistic missile . " " on the political front , this will be viewed as another step by obama to normalize relations with russia and therefore european-russian relations , " beaver said . russian officials said they did not want to comment on the u.s. media reports .
" we are waiting for confirmation , " the foreign ministry said . other systems still under consideration news about shelving the defense system has rung the alarm bells in eastern europe , where officials have expressed concerns that the obama white house effort to " reset " relations with moscow will come at their expense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is said to want to re-set relations with moscow polish deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer said he would be flying to washington in the next 10 days with deputy defense minister stanislav komorovski to discuss the issue . aleksander szczyglo , poland 's chief of national security , said " if confirmed , it would be a failure in long-term thinking in the us administration regarding this part of europe . "
he said the proposed missile shield had not only a " military dimension " , but also a " political and strategic " one . poland , in particular , has lobbied the white house to deploy patriot missile batteries in the country , manned by american troops , as another option . and although polish officials strongly supported former president bush 's missile defense plans , us officials have said that their primary desire was to get us military personnel on the ground in poland . author : gregg benzow editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spanish national court judge has issued international arrest warrants for three alleged former guards at nazi concentration camps , who are charged with complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity . international arrest warrants were issued on thursday by judge ismael moreno , of spain 's national court , for three men alleged to have worked as prison guards at nazi concentration camps .
the three , all in their mid 80 's , are johann leprich and anton tittjung , both believed to live in the united states , and josias kumpf , who is thought to live in austria .
the warrants were issued after a spanish lawsuit was filed by survivors of the world war ii concentration camps mauthausen , sachsenhausen and flossenberg .
according to moreno , some 7,000 spaniards were incarcerated in mauthausen where an estimated 4,300 of them perished .
the lawsuit also targets 89 year-old ukrainian-born john demjanjuk .
however , moreno decided not to indict him as he is already under investigation in germany , where he is facing charges relating to the deaths of 29,000 jews at the sobibor camp in what is now poland .

the winner , who will receive over 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- in prize money , will be announced on oct .
12 at the frankfurt book fair .
images of horror herta mueller is the most famous of those nominated on the shortlist , and her novel " atemschaukel " -lrb- everything i possess i carry with me -rrb- is the favorite .
the author , who has received numerous awards , writes about the horrors ethnic germans from romania experienced in a soviet work camp .
the book is based on interviews with some of the deported , including the poet oskar pastior .
he , like mueller , was a part of the german minority in romania , and they had planned to write the book together until pastior 's death in 2006 .
" atemschaukel " is a tender homage to the poet , and the most political book on this year 's shortlist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author herta mueller eifel blues until now , it 's been a smaller crowd that is familiar with norbert scheuer 's work , even though he 's written several novels and novellas .
all are based in the semi-mountainous region in west-central germany known as the eifel , where the author grew up .
" ueberm rauschen " -lrb- the rushing of the water -rrb- tells the story of a man who returns to his homeland and attempts to make sense of the shattered pieces of his life .
an almost magical world of fish presents a contrast to this , as does a river in which memories flow away , and whose rushing sound blends out all the unpleasantness .
saying goodbye to dreams with his debut novel " grenzgang " -lrb- walking the boundaries -rrb- , stephan thome also takes the reader to the provinces .
he writes of shattered dreams and people around the age of 40 , who have not lived up to their potential .
there 's the scientist , who has failed in the big city , and now lives the dreary life of a lecturer in a village in the state of hesse .
or a dancer who ends up as a single mother overwhelmed with life .
as the title suggests , the paths of these two cross - at a three-day village festival - with an unimaginable force of attraction .
stephan thome is himself from hesse , but currently lives in taipei , and dares to take a literary look at his homeland .
love in the waiting loop rainer merkel 's novel " lichtjahre entfernt " -lrb- light years away -rrb- looks at " placing " or " positioning " memory .
in the book , a family therapist is on his way to the airport in new york and thinks about the past few years of his life .
he recalls affairs , adventures and his one true love , who seems to be light-years away .
in his third novel , merkel - who is a trained psychologist - plumbs the inner world of a man who is stingy both with money and with his feelings .
the body : a prison the most personal book on this year 's shortlist is " du stirbst nicht " -lrb- you 're not going to die -rrb- by katrin schmidt , who has primarily wowed audiences with the powerful use of language in her novels .
a trained psychologist herself , the author has always focused on the psyches of her characters .
but , in 2002 , then 44-year-old schmidt suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage that stripped her of her abilities of speech and movement .
this is what her new novel addresses - experiencing one 's own limits , losing one 's ability to speak , and how this powerlessness manifests itself in the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " die frequenzen " by clemens j. setz gloomy panopticon at 27 , the graz-based author clemens j. setz is the youngest among the nominated writers .
his 700-page novel " die frequenzen " -lrb- the frequencies -rrb- is also the most unusual on the shortlist .
the book contains letters , newspaper reports and a series of monologues by a dog - all of which are linked together .
in the novel , paintings begin to talk and computers lose their minds .
the story also revolves around the lives of two young men , and graz , the capital of the austrian state of steiermark .
clemens j. setz received the ernst willner prize at the ingeborg bachmann literary competition in 2008 and is the only austrian candidate this year .
shattered dreams , personal retrospection and stories from the provinces are at the helm this year .
historical topics and political views play only a minor role .
the jury has placed many , largely unknown authors on the shortlist , whose literature is yet to be discovered , but is no less exciting for it .

2 to vote again on the eu 's reform treaty , after rejecting it last year .
as women were one of the largest groups opposed to the lisbon treaty , a campaign aims to address their concerns . in last year 's referendum , 56 percent of women voted " no " to the lisbon treaty , a worrying statistic for those campaigning for a " yes " vote this time around .
why were female voters so anxious about the treaty ?
the feminist open forum recently invited a number of female politicians on both sides of the divide to debate the matter and ask whether the lisbon treaty was good for women .
ailbhe smyth , spokesperson for the feminist open forum says there are two main issues for women voters - conscription and abortion .
" the government tended to interpret the ' no ' as women being very nervous about the possibility of conscription into military units within the eu , or concerned that abortion would be legitimated by our membership in the eu , both or which are completely inaccurate scenarios , " smyth said .
" it ca n't have been only about that .
we think the women who were voting ' no ' did so because of fears about anticipated cuts to public service and the privatization and de-regulation of public services like health and education . "
since ireland joined what was then known as the european economic community in 1973 , europe has been a driving force for gender equality in the irish workplace .
women now have better maternity rights , more flexible working arrangements , and they get better pay - although research shows men still get paid more , particularly at management level .
but the question is , does the lisbon treaty have direct implications for women ?
green party senator and former european parliamentarian deirdre de burca believes it does : she says it 's a positive thing for women right across europe and the developing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon supporters are hoping this time , more women will say " yes " " the charter of fundamental rights is a very important part of the treaty , " she said .
" it promotes equality for women , and it protects them from discrimination and human trafficking .
trafficking is a serious problem , and most victims seem to be women and children .
-lsb- the charter -rsb- is going to enhance the eu 's ability to act at a transnational level to address the problem of trafficking of women for sexual exploitation . "
de burca added that women in developing countries also stand to benefit from the lisbon treaty because it includes " very strong development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies , which are going to be central . "
an isolationist ireland ?
irish labour party parliamentarian joan burton is concerned about ireland 's reputation , which she says would be badly damaged by another negative vote .
" a ' no ' to lisbon at this point would send out a very negative signal about an ireland that is not just mired in economic difficulty , but would also send a message that we are retreating from our involvement in europe , " burton said .
" now is not the time for ireland to become isolationist . "
but not all of ireland 's female politicians agree .
former european parliamentarian and vice president of sinn fein mary lou macdonald , is campaigning for another " no " vote .
she says the majority of women rejected the treaty last time because , like her , they believed it was a bad deal for ireland and the eu .
macdonald says ireland 's position of neutrality could be diluted if the treaty is passed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female voters are said to be concerned about issues such as cuts to public services , conscription and abortion " each of the member states has their own particular history and foreign policy and they differ very greatly from a country like ireland , " she said .
what i have a problem with is the eu going on a solo run , developing an incredible military capacity , saying we can intervene in a wide range of issues , so that it leaves things wide open . "
employment issues a main concern patricia mckenna , a former european parliamentarian and chairperson of the anti-lisbon group the people 's movement , is also campaigning against the treaty .
she says women will not be specifically affected by the lisbon treaty , but that the rights of both male and female workers will suffer if it is passed .
" there are serious implications because of the recent judgments making it possible for employers to take in people from other countries at much lower salaries than we have here , " mckenna said .
" women in the lower paid sectors of employment will , i think , be forced into a situation whereby if they want the job , they will have to accept the lower salaries .
i 'm not against people from other countries getting work , but i think it will be difficult for some women . "

among them are many rare copies , books that long have been out of print .
the people browsing the endless shelves for a hidden gem mostly want the real thing – a physical book .
for many , the hunt for the book is almost as important as the book itself .
" i would kill to find the book i want , " one of them jokes .
just down the road from de slegte bookshop , however , executives from google have been setting out their vision for an entirely different world .
a global empire of digitalized books that 's set to revolutionize the way we read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wíll reading a book made from paper soon be a thing of the past ?
" if i had my way in fifteen years from now , i should be able to go into a bookstore and buy any book ever published , any book ever printed , " says dan clancy , director of google books engineering .
" i should be able to buy it as a physical book or a digital book .
some people will physical books , some more digital books , others both . "
europe still needs to be won over dan clancy has been pushing hard to try to persuade weary european publishers and authors to sign up to the project .
in the united states , google books already has started working with libraries to digitalize millions of books and it looks set to have the exclusive right to sell out-of-print and out-of-copyright books – a global stock of up to nine million books .
but in europe there are big fears that google will just sling books online without prior agreement from european publishers .
" if a copy of a book published in europe finds its way to us libraries , google could scan that book even if the rights have not been sold in the us market , " says angela mills wade of the european publisher 's council .
" and this of course could possibly harm the publisher 's own opportunities to sell those rights . "
bernard gerard , director of the association of belgian publishers , says copyright infringement is the crucial issue at stake .
bildunterschrift : critics warn that the copyright infringments could hurt european publishers and authors " the problem is that it 's very complicated for any publisher to check which books google has already put online . "
he cautions that it would " take years " for google to meet european copyright demands – which vary in every country .
" the right to digitalize books ultimately rests with the editor , " gerard explains .
" no book should go online without a previous deal with the editor .
if that does n't happen , there is a clear violation . "
in countries like germany , spain , switzerland , there 's also lots of concern that google would have the global monopoly over books .
google has now made concessions to european publishers and despite the fears that it will become a big monopoly , many booksellers are enthusiastic .
several publishing houses and prestigious university libraries , such as gent and oxford say they already have registered an increased usage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of librarians from the us have offered their books for scanning " if you are a student and want to just read one chapter it 's far easier just to search online .
you do n't have to go to the library and spent ages looking for it . "
google 's dan clancy says . preserving cultural heritage booksellers are not necessarily opposed to the google project .
in many cases it 's a question of whether these books disappear from the cultural heritage altogether or whether they can be preserved in digital form .
at de sletge , koen bonnevie holds up a magnificent , gigantic leather-bound volume .
" this is a very rare edititon , " he says .
" it has engravings of the old testament and you will never be able to replicate this online .
there will always be people who want the book itself .
but when all copies are gone from the market , you will still be able to look at it online .
and i see this as a good thing . i think it will hurt us a little bit but not very much . "
after all , there probably will remain those bookworms scanning the shelves at de sletge .
" i love the touch , the feel and smell of a book , " one shopper says .
" it 's a passion .
going online could never be the same . "
so while google books really has a winning argument when it says it wants to preserve books for eternity by putting them online , it will never be able to replace the aura of a beautiful book .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 17.09.2009 us targets russian support on iran with shield reverse , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama hopes for russian support for his policy on iran scrapping the us missile shield project has more to do with iran than just its perceived lack of current threat , say experts .
removing the barrier to dialogue with russia could give the us a powerful ally against tehran . president barack obama is preparing to scrap the previous us administration ’ s plans to build a missile defense shield in europe , one of george w. bush 's most controversial legacies . citing officials familiar with the plan , the wall street journal reported thursday that the obama administration 's information on the current scale and progress of iran 's missile development program is slower and less widespread than first thought . the threat from iranian nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the united states over europe was one of the main justifications for the shield . the white house now believes that iran has been slower in building long-range missiles and that the threat is now far less immediate and as a result , the bush-era missile defense project can be halted .
the research into iran 's capabilities and the evidence which justifies the scrapping of the plan is due to presented in a report published next week . dr. karl-heinz kamp , the research director at the nato defense college in rome , told deutsche welle that the us decision would leave many experts , himself included , confused , specifically on the topic of iran 's threat . contradictons in messages over iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's shahab-3 missile has a range of up to 2,000 km " this decision will be very hard for some to understand , " he said .
" on the one hand , you have the obama administration saying that iran is not as much of a threat as before , and therefore there is no need for the defense shield .
on the other , the official white house line is that iran is still actively pursuing its nuclear program and is not willing to abandon this . " kamp believes iran features in the reasoning behind the scrapping of the plan , but not in the way being presented by the obama administration . " this decision is being taken with relations with russia in mind , " he said .
" by scrapping the shield , the us removes a huge barrier to relations and will clear the way for improvements and the much-touted pressing of the reset button .
however , the other reason is the us hope that by removing the shield , it can persuade russia to take a stronger anti-iran stance .
but there are risks here .
no one is sure that russia will respond by supporting us pressure on iran and secondly , whether iran would take any notice even if it did . " russia integral to iran 's progress andrew brooks , a defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies in london , also believes the us is working toward engaging russia as an ally in its iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran relies heavily on russian missile and nuclear expertise " it 's well known that iran is ten to 20 years away from a long-range missile which could reach an american city , even if it wanted to attack the us , which many believe is highly unlikely anyway , " he told deutsche welle .
" but they could only reach this capability and build a nuclear program with russian assistance .
only with russia on board can the us stop iran building the missiles and reaching its nuclear goals .
obama is right to engage with russia to solve the problem with iran rather than antagonizing moscow with the missile shield and driving it into iran 's open arms . " another risk , kamp believes , is the deterioration of trust and cooperation with the eastern european countries which signed up to the bush administration 's plans in return for financial incentives , military equipment and geo-political support .
as part of the missile shield project , the czech republic agreed to host a radar base and poland was to allow ten interceptor missile batteries to be deployed on its territory . compliant europeans undermined by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles and the czechs did deals with a very different us " first of all , this is not such a huge deal for the whole of europe , " he said .
" we are not seeing the security and defense of europe sacrificed on the altar of us-russian relations .
this is not a withdrawal from the idea of missile defense either as the us even has a law that obliges each president to pursue missile defense as long as the technical capabilities exist and the us can absorb the bearable costs . " but for the czech republic and poland - this is a big deal .
they will not only lose what the us promised in terms of rewards but they have exposed themselves to criticism from russia and their allies .
the us has undermined these countries in their relations with russia and others for the sake of its own relationship with moscow . " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , believes that while the czech republic and poland will suffer , the us itself may have burnt some bridges in europe through its decision on missile defense . us faces a loss of trust and a tarnished image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is obama prepared to pay a high price for russian support ?
" the apparent decision of the obama administration to shelve the plans for a missile defense shield in central europe doubtlessly constitutes a considerable blow to czech and polish political elites , " he told deutsche welle . " even 20 years after the end of the cold war , the central european eu / nato members continue to perceive russia as a potential threat to their security .
for prague and warsaw , the planned missile defense shield is therefore also a crucial means to demonstrate to moscow that they have become an integral part of the euro-atlantic security architecture .
" the decision of the obama administration is likely to prompt the czechs and the polish to reevaluate the role of the us in their foreign and security policy planning , " he added .
" a crucial result of this re-evaluation might be that prague and warsaw will increasingly tend to seek security through the eu ’ s security and defense policy -lrb- esdp -rrb- rather than through cooperation with the us and nato .
doubtlessly the us has lost quite a lot of trust . " karl-heinz kamp believes that the image of the us is also at risk , not just in europe but in the wider world . " the united states is at risk of undermining itself with this decision , " he said .
" after ten years - because this is not just george w. bush 's idea but one planned by the clinton administration - they are now turning round and saying that there is not such a big threat and we no longer need this shield .
and this is not the first time that this has been done , overturning a seemingly immovable piece of policy .
if every few years a new president makes such a u-turn , what image does this put out ? " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel opened the frankfurt motor show thursday with a speech that looked to the future of transportation with electric and hybrid cars . merkel said widespread " green " car use was still some time off but that her government was making big investments into programs that would push green technology forward and make the eco-friendly cars more readily available on the market . " electro-mobility , electric and hybrid cars are very much the future , " she said in her opening speech at the show , which runs until september 27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a lot of interest in frankfurt in electric-powered cars , like this model from renault merkel also said she hopes germany will have 1 million electric cars on the road by 2020 , which means that it " it would really take another generation of car buyers " before this trend becomes mainstream here . merkel said she hopes germany will remain the automotive leader it is as the face of the industry changes .
some asian car companies have heavily stepped up production of green cars and are on the cutting edge when it comes to green automotive technology . " if asian markets take over the lead role and we lose the upper hand in standardization , then we will also lose he markets , " merkel said . merkel also had words of support for the general german car industry in general , which has recently found itself embroiled with the european commission over environmental standards . " in a free world , it ca n't be that we prescribe the size of a car , " she said , referring to the eu 's plans to penalize automakers that produce larger cars that are less fuel efficient .
" if the producers of large cars did not exist , the innovation of small ones could not be implemented so quickly . " though german car companies have are also producing electric and hybrid cars , they rely almost entirely on profits from standard gas models and aren ’ t looking to jeopardize the health of that sector of industry . “ germany is playing it smart with their multi facted approach , ” tim urquhart , an auto analyst at ihs global insight , told deutsche welle .
“ they care deeply about green technology and electric cars and the whole bit , but they 're going to wait and see how much the trend catches on .
when it comes to all this new technology , no one knows what the end game is going to be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2009 france defends plans to close migrants camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of migrants had been hoping calais would be just a stepping stone on the way to britain french officials have been explaining the decision to close down a provisional migrant camp near calais , known as the " the jungle " , despite un warnings of france 's duty towards people fleeing from conflict zones . vandalism , theft and human-trafficking were contributing factors in france 's decision to close down the makeshift camp , known as ' the jungle ' , near the channel port of calais within the next 10 days .
the northern region of france has attracted thousands of migrants from impoverished nations , including afghanistan and iraq , over the past decade . their hope was that calais would prove to be the gateway to a new life in britain .
on thursday , calais mayor natacha bouchart defended the decision to close the camp , saying this would end an unbearable situation for the region 's local people .
french state official ivan bouchner also referred to numerous incidents of theft and vandalism .
“ the state is here to protect the people of calais and its region , ” bouchner said .
“ the aim is to send the message that you ca n't cross the channel in calais , and to hit at the traffickers ' logistics base . ”
while officials argued that the camp was being used by people-smuggling gangs , the un 's main refugee body warned that france had a duty towards migrants from conflict-ridden areas of the world .
“ we understand the french authorities ' position .
the living conditions for migrants in these camps are unacceptable , ” said william spindler , spokesman for the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
“ but if we close ‘ the jungle ' , it is important that the migrants are given a chance to apply for asylum , in particular those who come from somalia , iraq or afghanistan . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleeping conditions at the camp are rough according to officials , the closure operation had been planned for six months . dozens of migrant squats had already been been closed down and further operations were expected .
the number of migrants has already been cut from 700 three months ago to 300 . 170 have requested asylum in france rather than try to reach britain . the migrants have three choices : to return to their homeland , apply for asylum in france , or face deportation .
however , french immigration minister eric besson has given an assurance that there would be no forced repatriation to unsafe countries .
the goal was to find an individual solution for each migrant .
however , aid groups working in the area fear that closing the camp will not end the problem ; the migrants will just move somewhere else .
“ instead of pulling them out of the jungle for them to set up another , let 's take time to inform them .
we are doing everything to create new problems just as things were starting to improve , ” friar jean-piere boutoille , of the c-sur coalition of aid groups told afp. mo / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the equalities office tells the paper that the oversight is being " updated " .
liberal democrat leader nick clegg writes in the times that his party is to focus its general election campaign on labour , not tory , seats .
he says the liberal democrats and labour share the goal of a fairer , more equal society - but that labour 's methods have had their day .
the guardian has a warning by a senior chinese government adviser .
they say china will not reduce its greenhouse gas emissions enough to meet g8 and european union targets .
several papers have pictures of the world 's tallest man - all 8ft 1in of him , posing in london at the launch of the 2010 guinness world records .
the express says the main drawbacks for sultan kosen , from turkey , are not being able to fit into a car , and not having a girlfriend .
" i 've never had a girlfriend " , he says , " they 're usually scared of me " .
but he tells the times his height is useful , as his family get him to change the lightbulbs and hang the curtains .
