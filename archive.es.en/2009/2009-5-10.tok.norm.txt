merkel is scheduled to make a reciprocal trip to paris at the end of this month , a diplomat said .
" we carry weight when we are united and when we know what to decide , " sarkozy said in germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that his relationship with merkel was " efficient . "
" she knows that she can rely on me like i know i can rely on her , " he said .
however , sarkozy also said his comments were not intended as an endorsement of support for merkel in her bid to win re-election as chancellor in september .
the french president insisted that was " for the germans to decide . "
turkey too much for the european union locking step on the issue of turkish eu membership , the two leaders questioned the wisdom of such a move during a meeting of young politicians from the conservative parties of germany and france .
chancellor merkel said it made no sense for the european union to continuously expand , if the growth leaves the union unable to operate .
at the same meeting , sarkozy proposed a large joint economic area , saying that a similar concept might work to bind russia closer to the eu .
merkel struck a similar note , saying the eu did not want to ignore the east , but needed to remain functional .
sarkozy also said he supports germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .
over a working dinner , the two leaders are also expected to privately discuss the next european summit in june and the group of eight summit in italy in july . gb / sp , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .
" it shows the excellent cooperation between the afghan and german forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " dingo " armored vehicles on patrol in kunduz the two leaders also discussed a controversial shi 'ite family law , under which husbands can demand sex from their wives .
karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .

karzai has recently been under fire from western countries , which accuse him of doing too little to bolster security and fight corruption and drug cultivation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.05.2009 germany stumbles in search for opel investor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing german automaker opel faces a cloudy future germany 's economics minister has failed to secure arab investment for struggling carmaker opel during a three-day visit to the gulf region . the economics minister of the united arab emirates , sultan bin said al mansouri , has dashed german hopes for a swift cash injection for the ailing carmaker opel .
he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions fear that fiat chief sergio marchionne will cut jobs in germany german labor leaders and politicians fear that a takeover by fiat could result in the loss of thousands of opel jobs in germany .
italian unions have expressed similar fears after a report this week claimed fiat plans to slash 18,000 jobs by closing or scaling down 10 factories in europe , if it takes over opel .
italian news agency ansa has reported that italian unions on saturday said they would meet their german colleagues in frankfurt on may 13 to discuss the takeover . nk , sp / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .
pius xii a bone of contention on monday , the pope will begin the second stage of his trip by flying to israel where he is also expected again to focus on building bridges between the faiths .
israel and the vatican have clashed in recent months over the papal decision to lift the excommunication of a holocaust-denying bishop , richard williamson of britain , and moves to canonize pope pius xii .
the jewish state reviles pius for what it perceives as his passive stance during the holocaust in world war ii. ch / ai , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .

they claimed they wanted to liberate athens and greece from what they described as " hordes of illegal immigrants " .
they unrolled a huge greek flag and banners calling for the " departure of foreigners from greece " and claiming " foreigners equal crime " .
at the city 's old court of appeal , where 500 immigrants have been squatting for several weeks , dozens of protesters hurled rocks and firecrackers at the eight-story building which has no electricity , running water or sanitation .
others shouted " out of greece " and " leave greece for the greeks " .
the squatters retaliated by throwing stones from the upper floors of the building and riot police were called to break up the clashes .
counter-protest triggers further violence further fighting broke out between the neo-nazis and a group of anarchists , as police struggled to separate the two sides .
in a counter-protest , the young anarchists protested against the extremists ' demonstration , which they termed a " racist gathering " .
they set fire to garbage cans and cars .
there were no injuries but at least two people were arrested .
the clashes followed a call from rights groups for the greek government to abandon a planned police operation , that would see the immigrants expelled from the old courthouse .
they suggested instead the building be cleaned until appropriate alternative lodging can be found .
greece has been rocked by a wave of violence since december , when the fatal police shooting of a teenager triggered the country 's worst riots in decades . cg / nrt , dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 10.05.2009 thousands rally to mark one month of georgia protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mikhail saakashvili is the opposition 's direct firing line thousands of protestors rallied in georgia 's capital tbilisi on saturday , demanding the president step down .
that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .
it was the first major outbreak since the protests began .
officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .
it was the first major outbreak since the protests began .
officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .

germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper reported that washington had provided berlin with a list of nine chinese muslims , members of the uighur ethnic group , that it hoped germany would offer refuge to .
" the information that we 've received so far from washington is insufficient for us to take a decision on whether to accept any one of the cases , " schaueble told the paper . the minister said a number of concerns needed to be addressed before germany could take a decision on whether to accept the detainees .
" first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat because this is a worry of many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them on ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? " he said . bavarian minister rejects uighur detainees bild reported that bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann is opposed to taking in any of the uighur detainees .
herrmann was quoted as saying that security intelligence showed seven of the nine uighurs reportedly being considered for resettlement in germany had been trained in camps of the east turkestan islamic movement -lrb- etim -rrb- and had contacts to militant islamist organisations .
" we do n't need those kind of people in germany , " hermann told the newspaper , adding that us demands were unreasonable .

germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper reported that washington had provided berlin with a list of nine chinese muslims , members of the uighur ethnic group , that it hoped germany would offer refuge to .
" the information that we 've received so far from washington is insufficient for us to take a decision on whether to accept any one of the cases , " schaueble told the paper . the minister said a number of concerns needed to be addressed before germany could take a decision on whether to accept the detainees .
" first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat because this is a worry of many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them on ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? " he said . bavarian minister rejects uighur detainees bild reported that bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann is opposed to taking in any of the uighur detainees .
herrmann was quoted as saying that security intelligence showed seven of the nine uighurs reportedly being considered for resettlement in germany had been trained in camps of the east turkestan islamic movement -lrb- etim -rrb- and had contacts to militant islamist organisations .
" we do n't need those kind of people in germany , " hermann told the newspaper , adding that us demands were unreasonable .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regional security and germany 's role in afghanistan 's reconstruction top the agenda for sunday 's meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and afghan president hamid karzai , in berlin . the talks between merkel and karzai are expected to focus on the reconstruction of afghanistan , the ongoing fight against the islamist taliban and the increasingly dangerous situation faced by german troops in northern afghanistan .
german news magazine der spiegel reported in its latest edition that the taliban was planning massive attacks on german soldiers to put pressure on politicians as the september general election draws close .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan 's kunduz region .
germany has 3,800 soldiers based in the relatively tranquil north of the country while us , british and canadian troops are battling the taliban in the south .
a german soldier was killed two weeks ago in a taliban ambush near the city of kunduz , the 32nd german soldier killed while serving with the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan .
karzai must do more to put his house in order .
meanwhile , in an interview with german newspaper berliner zeitung , the eu 's foreign affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , raised the pressure on karzai to do more to put his troubled country 's affairs in order .
on saturday ferrero-waldner urged karzai to do more to fight corruption and put his country on the path to modernization .
the afghan government must show , better than they have in the past , “ that they are working to move the country forward ; that they are working to develop an administrative infrastructure , and to crack down on corruption , ” ferrero-waldner told the paper .
“ mistakes were made in the past , ” she added .
german foreign policy expert eckhart von klaeden , of merkel 's christian democratic party , told the berliner zeitung karzai needed to act " more decisively against corruption and the cultivation of drugs . "
there were signs " that this decisiveness is lacking , " he said .
green party defence spokeswoman winfried nachtwei warned the german government against complacency .
merkel should say " what germany will do against the downward spiral which we are witnessing in afghanistan 's security and political legitimacy , " nachtwei said .
both karzai and merkel are seeking re-election this year in their respective countries .

others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .

on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .
" it shows the excellent cooperation between the afghan and german forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " dingo " armored vehicles on patrol in kunduz the two leaders also discussed a controversial shi 'ite family law , under which husbands can demand sex from their wives .
karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans burn confiscated drugs at ceremonies like this one on april 26 in which 6.5 tons went up in smoke merkel agreed that everything needed to be done to stabilize the situation in pakistan and welcomed talks between afghanistan and its neighbor .
karzai has recently been under fire from western countries , which accuse him of doing too little to bolster security and fight corruption and drug cultivation .

in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "

" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .
" it shows the excellent cooperation between the afghan and german forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " dingo " armored vehicles on patrol in kunduz the two leaders also discussed a controversial shi 'ite family law , under which husbands can demand sex from their wives .
karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans burn confiscated drugs at ceremonies like this one on april 26 in which 6.5 tons went up in smoke merkel agreed that everything needed to be done to stabilize the situation in pakistan and welcomed talks between afghanistan and its neighbor .
karzai has recently been under fire from western countries , which accuse him of doing too little to bolster security and fight corruption and drug cultivation .
the european union 's external relations commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , has called on the afghan president to " advance the country , build an administrative infrastructure and take steps against corruption .

merkel is scheduled to make a reciprocal trip to paris at the end of this month , a diplomat said .
" we carry weight when we are united and when we know what to decide , " sarkozy said in germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that his relationship with merkel was " efficient . "
" she knows that she can rely on me like i know i can rely on her , " he said .
however , sarkozy also said his comments were not intended as an endorsement of support for merkel in her bid to win re-election as chancellor in september .
the french president insisted that was " for the germans to decide . "
turkey too much for the european union locking step on the issue of turkish eu membership , the two leaders questioned the wisdom of such a move during a meeting of young politicians from the conservative parties of germany and france .
chancellor merkel said it made no sense for the european union to continuously expand , if the growth leaves the union unable to operate .
at the same meeting , sarkozy proposed a large joint economic area , saying that a similar concept might work to bind russia closer to the eu .
merkel struck a similar note , saying the eu did not want to ignore the east , but needed to remain functional .
sarkozy also said he supports germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .
over a working dinner , the two leaders are also expected to privately discuss the next european summit in june and the group of eight summit in italy in july . gb / sp , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .

officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .

" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .

at the city 's old court of appeal , where 500 immigrants have been squatting for several weeks , dozens of protesters hurled rocks and firecrackers at the eight-story building which has no electricity , running water or sanitation .

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .
later on sunday benedict is to visit bethany on the east bank of the river jordan where christians believe jesus was baptised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .
pius xii a bone of contention on monday , the pope will begin the second stage of his trip by flying to israel where he is also expected again to focus on building bridges between the faiths .
israel and the vatican have clashed in recent months over the papal decision to lift the excommunication of a holocaust-denying bishop , richard williamson of britain , and moves to canonize pope pius xii .
the jewish state reviles pius for what it perceives as his passive stance during the holocaust in world war ii. ch / ai , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 21 stages cover 3,454 kilometres and , following the wishes of director angelo zomegnan , will have riders stop at all the sites of the maiden edition in 1909 , including difficult stages through the dolomites and alps .
one rider who will be particularly fond of the mountain stages is lance armstrong , the man who has become the symbol of professional cycling over the past 15 years .
the 37-year-old american rider has returned to cycling to promote his livestrong cancer charity after three years in retirement .
the giro is part of his preparation for the tour de france , and his aim to win his eighth tour .
his dreams of also winning the giro were dashed some two months ago when he shattered a collarbone in a crash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong is just returning after fracturing his collarbone in spain that 's not all armstrong will be worrying about .
the future of his astana team is also under threat .
the kazakh-based team has been hit hard by the world economic crisis and riders have not been paid for months .
at this stage , it is not certain of whether astana will even be able to compete at the tour in july .
there is talk of a takeover , but armstrong is unsure .
" i am optimistic .
various american multinationals have shown interest in our project .
before the end of the giro we will know if we will go ahead with astana or not , " armstrong told reporters .
doping clamp down meanwhile , giro officials will be concerning themselves over an issue that will not go away : doping .
just days before the first stage , the austrian champion , christian pfannberger tested positive a second time for erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- and was subsequently banned .
german rider stefan schumacher , who last year rode in the yellow jersey for two days of the tour , was caught with cera , a new version of epo and has been banned from the sport for two years .
giro organizers have promised to take a tough stand against doping this year .
ahead of the race , giro chief angelo zomegnan announced that 481 doping controls and several surprise tests would take place during the three-week race .
" we have made a step forward in terms of doping tests compared to the past , " he said . author : john kluempers / catherine graue editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper reported that washington had provided berlin with a list of nine chinese muslims , members of the uighur ethnic group , that it hoped germany would offer refuge to .
" the information that we 've received so far from washington is insufficient for us to take a decision on whether to accept any one of the cases , " schaueble told the paper . the minister said a number of concerns needed to be addressed before germany could take a decision on whether to accept the detainees .
" first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat because this is a worry of many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them on ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? " he said . bavarian minister rejects uighur detainees bild reported that bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann is opposed to taking in any of the uighur detainees .
herrmann was quoted as saying that security intelligence showed seven of the nine uighurs reportedly being considered for resettlement in germany had been trained in camps of the east turkestan islamic movement -lrb- etim -rrb- and had contacts to militant islamist organisations .
" we do n't need those kind of people in germany , " hermann told the newspaper , adding that us demands were unreasonable .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .

but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .
it was the first major outbreak since the protests began .
officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .
also this week , the georgian government claims to have been hit by a bloodless military mutiny , just hours before the controversial nato military exercises in georgia began .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .
it was the first major outbreak since the protests began .
officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .
also this week , the georgian government claims to have been hit by a bloodless military mutiny , just hours before the controversial nato military exercises in georgia began .

they claimed they wanted to liberate athens and greece from what they described as " hordes of illegal immigrants " .
they unrolled a huge greek flag and banners calling for the " departure of foreigners from greece " and claiming " foreigners equal crime " .
at the city 's old court of appeal , where 500 immigrants have been squatting for several weeks , dozens of protesters hurled rocks and firecrackers at the eight-story building which has no electricity , running water or sanitation .
others shouted " out of greece " and " leave greece for the greeks " .
the squatters retaliated by throwing stones from the upper floors of the building and riot police were called to break up the clashes .
counter-protest triggers further violence further fighting broke out between the neo-nazis and a group of anarchists , as police struggled to separate the two sides .
in a counter-protest , the young anarchists protested against the extremists ' demonstration , which they termed a " racist gathering " .
they set fire to garbage cans and cars .
there were no injuries but at least two people were arrested .
the clashes followed a call from rights groups for the greek government to abandon a planned police operation , that would see the immigrants expelled from the old courthouse .
they suggested instead the building be cleaned until appropriate alternative lodging can be found .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are other things , however , other than the centenary , that are going to be in focus of cycling enthusiasts this tour . the giro d 'italia is the first of the year 's three large cycling tours , and it kicked off on saturday with a team time trial in venice .
the 100th edition of the giro d 'italia will , no by means , be a simple ride in the park .
the 21 stages cover 3,454 kilometres and , following the wishes of director angelo zomegnan , will have riders stop at all the sites of the maiden edition in 1909 , including difficult stages through the dolomites and alps .
one rider who will be particularly fond of the mountain stages is lance armstrong , the man who has become the symbol of professional cycling over the past 15 years .
the 37-year-old american rider has returned to cycling to promote his livestrong cancer charity after three years in retirement .
the giro is part of his preparation for the tour de france , and his aim to win his eighth tour .
his dreams of also winning the giro were dashed some two months ago when he shattered a collarbone in a crash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong is just returning after fracturing his collarbone in spain that 's not all armstrong will be worrying about .
the future of his astana team is also under threat .

at this stage , it is not certain of whether astana will even be able to compete at the tour in july .
there is talk of a takeover , but armstrong is unsure .
" i am optimistic .
various american multinationals have shown interest in our project .
before the end of the giro we will know if we will go ahead with astana or not , " armstrong told reporters .
doping clamp down meanwhile , giro officials will be concerning themselves over an issue that will not go away : doping .
just days before the first stage , the austrian champion , christian pfannberger tested positive a second time for erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- and was subsequently banned .
german rider stefan schumacher , who last year rode in the yellow jersey for two days of the tour , was caught with cera , a new version of epo and has been banned from the sport for two years .
giro organizers have promised to take a tough stand against doping this year .
ahead of the race , giro chief angelo zomegnan announced that 481 doping controls and several surprise tests would take place during the three-week race .

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .
" it shows the excellent cooperation between the afghan and german forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " dingo " armored vehicles on patrol in kunduz the two leaders also discussed a controversial shi 'ite family law , under which husbands can demand sex from their wives .
karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .
later on sunday benedict is to visit bethany on the east bank of the river jordan where christians believe jesus was baptised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .
pius xii a bone of contention on monday , the pope will begin the second stage of his trip by flying to israel where he is also expected again to focus on building bridges between the faiths .
israel and the vatican have clashed in recent months over the papal decision to lift the excommunication of a holocaust-denying bishop , richard williamson of britain , and moves to canonize pope pius xii .
the jewish state reviles pius for what it perceives as his passive stance during the holocaust in world war ii. ch / ai , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions fear that fiat chief sergio marchionne will cut jobs in germany german labor leaders and politicians fear that a takeover by fiat could result in the loss of thousands of opel jobs in germany .
italian unions have expressed similar fears after a report this week claimed fiat plans to slash 18,000 jobs by closing or scaling down 10 factories in europe , if it takes over opel .
italian news agency ansa has reported that italian unions on saturday said they would meet their german colleagues in frankfurt on may 13 to discuss the takeover . nk , sp / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.05.2009 germany stumbles in search for opel investor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing german automaker opel faces a cloudy future germany 's economics minister has failed to secure arab investment for struggling carmaker opel during a three-day visit to the gulf region . the economics minister of the united arab emirates , sultan bin said al mansouri , has dashed german hopes for a swift cash injection for the ailing carmaker opel .
he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions fear that fiat chief sergio marchionne will cut jobs in germany german labor leaders and politicians fear that a takeover by fiat could result in the loss of thousands of opel jobs in germany .
italian unions have expressed similar fears after a report this week claimed fiat plans to slash 18,000 jobs by closing or scaling down 10 factories in europe , if it takes over opel .
italian news agency ansa has reported that italian unions on saturday said they would meet their german colleagues in frankfurt on may 13 to discuss the takeover . nk , sp / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions fear that fiat chief sergio marchionne will cut jobs in germany german labor leaders and politicians fear that a takeover by fiat could result in the loss of thousands of opel jobs in germany .
italian unions have expressed similar fears after a report this week claimed fiat plans to slash 18,000 jobs by closing or scaling down 10 factories in europe , if it takes over opel .
italian news agency ansa has reported that italian unions on saturday said they would meet their german colleagues in frankfurt on may 13 to discuss the takeover . nk , sp / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .
it was the first major outbreak since the protests began .
officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .
also this week , the georgian government claims to have been hit by a bloodless military mutiny , just hours before the controversial nato military exercises in georgia began .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.05.2009 germany stumbles in search for opel investor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing german automaker opel faces a cloudy future germany 's economics minister has failed to secure arab investment for struggling carmaker opel during a three-day visit to the gulf region . the economics minister of the united arab emirates , sultan bin said al mansouri , has dashed german hopes for a swift cash injection for the ailing carmaker opel .
he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions fear that fiat chief sergio marchionne will cut jobs in germany german labor leaders and politicians fear that a takeover by fiat could result in the loss of thousands of opel jobs in germany .

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions fear that fiat chief sergio marchionne will cut jobs in germany german labor leaders and politicians fear that a takeover by fiat could result in the loss of thousands of opel jobs in germany .
italian unions have expressed similar fears after a report this week claimed fiat plans to slash 18,000 jobs by closing or scaling down 10 factories in europe , if it takes over opel .

the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .

karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .

karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .
" it shows the excellent cooperation between the afghan and german forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " dingo " armored vehicles on patrol in kunduz the two leaders also discussed a controversial shi 'ite family law , under which husbands can demand sex from their wives .
karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .

officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .
later on sunday benedict is to visit bethany on the east bank of the river jordan where christians believe jesus was baptised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .
pius xii a bone of contention on monday , the pope will begin the second stage of his trip by flying to israel where he is also expected again to focus on building bridges between the faiths .
israel and the vatican have clashed in recent months over the papal decision to lift the excommunication of a holocaust-denying bishop , richard williamson of britain , and moves to canonize pope pius xii .
the jewish state reviles pius for what it perceives as his passive stance during the holocaust in world war ii. ch / ai , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .

he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .

they claimed they wanted to liberate athens and greece from what they described as " hordes of illegal immigrants " .
they unrolled a huge greek flag and banners calling for the " departure of foreigners from greece " and claiming " foreigners equal crime " .
at the city 's old court of appeal , where 500 immigrants have been squatting for several weeks , dozens of protesters hurled rocks and firecrackers at the eight-story building which has no electricity , running water or sanitation .
others shouted " out of greece " and " leave greece for the greeks " .
the squatters retaliated by throwing stones from the upper floors of the building and riot police were called to break up the clashes .
counter-protest triggers further violence further fighting broke out between the neo-nazis and a group of anarchists , as police struggled to separate the two sides .
in a counter-protest , the young anarchists protested against the extremists ' demonstration , which they termed a " racist gathering " .
they set fire to garbage cans and cars .
there were no injuries but at least two people were arrested .
the clashes followed a call from rights groups for the greek government to abandon a planned police operation , that would see the immigrants expelled from the old courthouse .

on saturday ferrero-waldner urged karzai to do more to fight corruption and put his country on the path to modernization .
the afghan government must show , better than they have in the past , “ that they are working to move the country forward ; that they are working to develop an administrative infrastructure , and to crack down on corruption , ” ferrero-waldner told the paper .
“ mistakes were made in the past , ” she added .
german foreign policy expert eckhart von klaeden , of merkel 's christian democratic party , told the berliner zeitung karzai needed to act " more decisively against corruption and the cultivation of drugs . "
there were signs " that this decisiveness is lacking , " he said .
green party defence spokeswoman winfried nachtwei warned the german government against complacency .
merkel should say " what germany will do against the downward spiral which we are witnessing in afghanistan 's security and political legitimacy , " nachtwei said .

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .
later on sunday benedict is to visit bethany on the east bank of the river jordan where christians believe jesus was baptised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .

merkel is scheduled to make a reciprocal trip to paris at the end of this month , a diplomat said .
" we carry weight when we are united and when we know what to decide , " sarkozy said in germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that his relationship with merkel was " efficient . "
" she knows that she can rely on me like i know i can rely on her , " he said .
however , sarkozy also said his comments were not intended as an endorsement of support for merkel in her bid to win re-election as chancellor in september .
the french president insisted that was " for the germans to decide . "
turkey too much for the european union locking step on the issue of turkish eu membership , the two leaders questioned the wisdom of such a move during a meeting of young politicians from the conservative parties of germany and france .
chancellor merkel said it made no sense for the european union to continuously expand , if the growth leaves the union unable to operate .
at the same meeting , sarkozy proposed a large joint economic area , saying that a similar concept might work to bind russia closer to the eu .
merkel struck a similar note , saying the eu did not want to ignore the east , but needed to remain functional .
sarkozy also said he supports germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper reported that washington had provided berlin with a list of nine chinese muslims , members of the uighur ethnic group , that it hoped germany would offer refuge to .
" the information that we 've received so far from washington is insufficient for us to take a decision on whether to accept any one of the cases , " schaueble told the paper . the minister said a number of concerns needed to be addressed before germany could take a decision on whether to accept the detainees .
" first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat because this is a worry of many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them on ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? " he said . bavarian minister rejects uighur detainees bild reported that bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann is opposed to taking in any of the uighur detainees .
herrmann was quoted as saying that security intelligence showed seven of the nine uighurs reportedly being considered for resettlement in germany had been trained in camps of the east turkestan islamic movement -lrb- etim -rrb- and had contacts to militant islamist organisations .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .
it was the first major outbreak since the protests began .
officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .
also this week , the georgian government claims to have been hit by a bloodless military mutiny , just hours before the controversial nato military exercises in georgia began .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .

at the city 's old court of appeal , where 500 immigrants have been squatting for several weeks , dozens of protesters hurled rocks and firecrackers at the eight-story building which has no electricity , running water or sanitation .

at the city 's old court of appeal , where 500 immigrants have been squatting for several weeks , dozens of protesters hurled rocks and firecrackers at the eight-story building which has no electricity , running water or sanitation .

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .
later on sunday benedict is to visit bethany on the east bank of the river jordan where christians believe jesus was baptised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .
later on sunday benedict is to visit bethany on the east bank of the river jordan where christians believe jesus was baptised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .
pius xii a bone of contention on monday , the pope will begin the second stage of his trip by flying to israel where he is also expected again to focus on building bridges between the faiths .
israel and the vatican have clashed in recent months over the papal decision to lift the excommunication of a holocaust-denying bishop , richard williamson of britain , and moves to canonize pope pius xii .

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .

the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .

karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .

" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .

that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 10.05.2009 thousands rally to mark one month of georgia protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mikhail saakashvili is the opposition 's direct firing line thousands of protestors rallied in georgia 's capital tbilisi on saturday , demanding the president step down .
that came after talks between his administration and the opposition broke down . georgian opposition leaders accuse president mikhail saakashvili of mishandling last year 's war with russia over south ossetia , and of becoming increasingly autocratic since coming to power in the peaceful 2003 rose revolution .
saturday 's protests marked a month since they first began on april 9 and came a day after the first formal contact between saakashvili 's government and opposition leaders failed to make any progress in resolving the political stand-off .
opposition representatives at the talks said the government had failed to meet their key demand of setting a time and place for a meeting with saakashvili .
despite that , the european union hailed the start of talks as an important step forward .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter semneby described the talks as the first important step the eu 's envoy to the south caucasus , peter semneby said it was important they be followed up .
while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police wearing heavy gear surrounded the interior ministry in tbilisi protests end a tumultuous week the stand-off over saakashvili 's rule flared into violence this week , when clashes between police and protesters left 28 people injured .
it was the first major outbreak since the protests began .
officials said the clashes broke out after opposition supporters tried to storm a main police station and police used truncheons to repel protesters trying to climb a fence around the building .
the opposition claims police attacked protesters and fired rubber bullets .
that has been denied by officials and police have said nobody was seriously injured .

while semneby said the eu has a " profound interest " in events in georgia , he ruled out any direct mediation by the eu .
" the role we foresee for ourselves in this process is going to have to be determined by the georgians themselves .
this is about how georgia should be governed , " he said .
opposition leaders differ on approach several opposition leaders demanded direct talks with president saakashvili so they could tell him personally to quit .
" we are giving the president 24 hours to get in touch with us by telephone or any other means , otherwise we 'll let you know our plans on the continuation of our activities and their scope tomorrow evening , " salome zurabishvili , one of the protest leaders , told around 20,000 protesters in front of parliament .
others , like irakly alasania , urged patience .
alasania , georgia 's former ambassador to the united nations , who quit that post after the war with russia , said talks with parliament speaker david bakradze should continue .
" it should happen in the nearest time , i do not think we should create artificial barriers by giving ultimatums , " he said .
" we believe that the best outcome can be the achievement of free and fair elections for president and parliament , but we also understand there are issues the government wants to discuss with us and we are prepared to hear these issues . "
the government says it is offering talks on reforms to address opposition accusations that saakashvili has monopolised power , undermined the judiciary and repressed free media .
it claims these issues , and not the president 's resignation , should be the agenda for a meeting .

germany has already pledged to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by 600 , to 4,400 , in the months leading up to the country 's presidential election in august , in which karzai hopes to win another term in office .
karzai thanked germany for its efforts to date in training afghan security forces , although merkel said only 10 percent of the required personnel had been trained so far .
" we have a long way to go , " she said .
germans and afghans work hand-in-hand in joint operation the afghan president also praised a rare and significant joint operation by german and afghan special forces last week to capture a high-ranking taliban commander .
" this was good work done by the german forces , " karzai told reporters in berlin .
" it shows the excellent cooperation between the afghan and german forces . "

karzai said the legislation had already been changed and passed on to parliament for a new vote .
merkel welcomed the move by the afghan government and said she hoped that all the disconcerting passages had been removed .
merkel said there was " light and shade " in afghanistan , but praised the fact that six million children were now attending school across the country , many of them girls .
taliban insurgents and drug production are growing concerns karzai , for his part , expressed his concern about the high number of civilian casualties caused by the nato-led international security assistance force , isaf , in its fight against islamist taliban insurgents .
he also said the taliban 's stronger presence in pakistan 's border regions was a growing concern .
the spreading taliban insurgency is the main reason the united states will be sending an additional 20,000 troops to afghanistan in the coming weeks to boost the existing 58,000 isaf troops already there .

the 37-year-old american rider has returned to cycling to promote his livestrong cancer charity after three years in retirement .
the giro is part of his preparation for the tour de france , and his aim to win his eighth tour .
his dreams of also winning the giro were dashed some two months ago when he shattered a collarbone in a crash .

the future of his astana team is also under threat .
the kazakh-based team has been hit hard by the world economic crisis and riders have not been paid for months .
at this stage , it is not certain of whether astana will even be able to compete at the tour in july .
there is talk of a takeover , but armstrong is unsure .
" i am optimistic .

others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .

pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .

on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its visitors ' center hosts a museum and foundation that commemorates the decades of that border 's existence , from 1952 to 1990 .
its mandate : to keep the memory of divided germany alive . this week , point alpha celebrated the opening of a sculpture installation that runs along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- long section of the old " death strip " along the border .
called " weg der hoffnung " , or path of hope , it uses the 14 stations of the cross – the events of jesus ' final hours – as a metaphor for those who struggled for freedom and democracy in east germany . deutsche welle spoke with sculptor and philosopher ulrich barnickel about his artistic choices and what he hopes people will take away from the exhibit . deutsche welle : dr. barnickel , you were born in former east germany .
did that affect your approach to this project ? ulrich barnickel : yes , a lot .
i came to the west from the gdr 25 years ago .
my father was from bavaria , and my brother took off for the west in 1957 , when you could still easily cross the border .
we were a divided family . in the east , the fact that we had western relatives meant we were not ' politically reliable ' , so it was bad for us .
i could n't study what i wanted , and didn ’ t get work as an artist .
the situation got worse and worse … i was arrested , and my apartment was ransacked by the authorities . i was sick of it .
i applied to leave the country .
the stasi , the secret police , pressured me not to go .
they threatened me and my family .
but after about nine months they came to my apartment one night and told me i had to leave the next morning .
i packed my suitcase and took a train to the west . dw : did point alpha itself have particular meaning for you ? ub : if the americans had n't been here , the russians would have taken this country .
the two sides of that border were very close to each other .
it 's a miracle that no war broke out between them .
and it is a miracle , and an honor , that i can work on this project .
it allows me to process my own history . bildunterschrift : dw : why did you choose to use christian imagery to get your message across - specifically the stations of the cross ? in 1989 , during the velvet revolution , the church played an important role in the peace movement .
there were meetings , and church services that fed into the peaceful resistance .
and of course jesus was subjected to violence and to the power of someone else 's arbitrary decisions , like the people in the gdr were . but even though the bible story is the basis for the weg der hoffnung , the title of the sculptures do n't have the same titles as the stations .
for instance , the first biblical station of the cross is condemnation -lrb- when pontius pilate ordered jesus ’ s crucifixion . -rrb-
but i 've called it " arbitrariness " .
so i 'm creating an aphorism , a fable .
i am using old bible stories to build a bridge to the viewer . dw : why the stations of the cross , particularly ?
how does that relate to the history of a divided germany ? the historic scenes fit perfectly with telling our history .
when jesus stumbles the first time , i have him stumble over a grenade .
when he stumbles a second time , it looks like he is going to make it over the border - but then he arrives at a trench .
he 's already weak and ca n't cross the trench . its like the stasi who locked people up , beat them down , made them weak .
it was even harder for them after that .
jesus tried anyway .
it ’ s a depiction of resistance . dw : tell me about your artistic vision . i am not interested in portraits ; i want to capture a movement or a motion .
the jesus figure is going along the individual stations on the way to death .
i try to show his death in that he always gets smaller , less and less , until he is just a torso at the end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-occupied watchtower at point alpha still stands the scenes are n't historically correct , they are modern stories .
jesus is looking away from pontius and thinking , ' you ca n't condemn me , i have n't done anything ' .
pontius sits on a rickety chair – an unstable seat of power .
he has a dog 's face . he holds out his arm to condemn jesus but doesn ’ t do it by showing ' thumbs down ' like a roman would .
its more a gesture of brushing jesus off , like a fly .
he ’ s saying , ' get out of my sight .
you ’ re too too intellectual for me .
otherwise i ’ ll have to lock you up or kill you ' . dw : why did you choose to work in iron ? for many reasons .
first because it refers to the ' iron curtain ' that divided east from west .
second because iron goes well with nature .
it is dark brown when it rains , and honey colored in the sunshine .
its surface is changeable , like human skin . i use folded sheet metal .
i don ’ t work in closed masses , but in open forms – think of a crumpled up tissue that has volume , but not much mass .
also , i used accessories from the old east german era in the sculptures .
in the first sculpture , there is an original steel helmet from the gdr era hanging on pontius ’ s chair . dw : were you trying to make a point about connecting christianity with freedom and democracy ? this work is not just for christians .
its for muslims , jews … anyone should be able to go there .
people should see it , so we can prevent germany ’ s history from fading into oblivion . the young german generation , people who weren ’ t even born before 1989 , must know that this political system existed , and it existed close to home .
point alpha is itself a sign that we have to work for freedom .
its not just a gift . - we have to work to maintain it . two of ulrich barnickel 's sculpture groups were unveiled on wednesday , may 6 , 2009 .
the complete installation of 14 sculpture groups will be finished by october , 2010 . author : jennifer abramsohn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholics from across the middle east attended the service . as many as 20,000 people turned up at the stadium in amman on the third day of benedict 's weeklong pilgrimage to jordan , israel and the palestinian territories .
others had lined the route of the popemobile , greeting the pontiff with enthusiastic cheers as he passed on his way to the stadium .
many held up flags from lebanon , syria , iraq and other countries .
benedict said in english at the amman stadium that " the catholic community here is deeply touched by the difficulties and uncertainties which affect the people of the middle east . "
" may you never forget the great dignity which derives from your christian heritage , or fail to sense the loving solidarity of all your brothers and sisters in the church throughout the world . "
about 500 children were to receive their first communion at the sunday mass .
during the mass the pope also drew attention to womens ' rights around the world , saying women often did not get the recognition they deserved .
later on sunday benedict is to visit bethany on the east bank of the river jordan where christians believe jesus was baptised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been warmly welcomed on his visit to jordan no new apology forthcoming the pontiff , who arrived in jordan on friday for his first papal visit to an arab state , is to travel on to israel on monday as he follows his holy land pilgrimage in the footsteps of jesus christ .
on saturday , he urged inter-faith reconciliation but disappointed muslim clerics when he did not offer a new apology for remarks made in 2006 , seen as disparaging to the prophet muhammad .
in a keynote address to muslim leaders in amman 's huge al-hussein mosque , he warned against the " ideological manipulation of religion " and urged muslims and christians to unite as " worshippers of god . "
" certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied , " the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics told his audience .
" however , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
pressing the theme of reconciliation during a visit on saturday to mount nebo , where biblical tradition says god showed moses the promised land , benedict urged christians and jews to bridge their divides .
" the ancient tradition of pilgrimage to the holy places also reminds us of the inseparable bond between the church and the jewish people , " benedict said .
pius xii a bone of contention on monday , the pope will begin the second stage of his trip by flying to israel where he is also expected again to focus on building bridges between the faiths .
israel and the vatican have clashed in recent months over the papal decision to lift the excommunication of a holocaust-denying bishop , richard williamson of britain , and moves to canonize pope pius xii .
the jewish state reviles pius for what it perceives as his passive stance during the holocaust in world war ii. ch / ai , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told his german counterpart karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting in abu dhabi that his country was considering investments in potential joint ventures , but that no concrete decisions had yet been made .
the united arab emirates can reportedly tap up to 700 billion euros of state funds , and the german media have been speculating that the rich gulf state could invest in carmakers opel or porsche , especially after the arabs readily took a 9.1 precent stake in daimler , the maker of mercedes-benz cars , in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister zu guttenberg wants to save as many opel jobs as possible guttenberg , who was on a three-day tour of the gulf region , said the arabs had indicated that they would not make any decisions concerning opel until its nearly bankrupt us parent company general motors had drawn up a clear concept for the future of its german subsidiary .
the minister also said in an interview to be published in the german weekly magazine der spiegel on monday that berlin was looking for a way to protect opel if general motors goes bankrupt .
" it will be about protecting opel 's assets from gm 's creditors , " he said , referring to how opel can survive gm 's restructuring efforts to avoid going bust itself .
a potential solution would be a bridge loan for opel provided by a consortium , which analysts say would be tantamount to a government-owned stake in opel .
germans suspicious of fiat guttenberg was quoted by spiegel as saying that questions remain over plans by both italian automaker fiat and austrian-canadian auto parts manufacturer magna international to invest in opel , while stressing that he is equally open to both suitors .
fiat 's chief executive , sergio marchionne , visited germany twice in the past week to present officials with his plan to set up a gm europe operation with britain 's vauxhall , sweden 's saab and opel under the fiat umbrella .
marchionne is looking to build the world 's second largest carmaker with annual production volumes of over six million vehicles by uniting the aforementioned brands with bankrupt us ally chrysler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions fear that fiat chief sergio marchionne will cut jobs in germany german labor leaders and politicians fear that a takeover by fiat could result in the loss of thousands of opel jobs in germany .
italian unions have expressed similar fears after a report this week claimed fiat plans to slash 18,000 jobs by closing or scaling down 10 factories in europe , if it takes over opel .
italian news agency ansa has reported that italian unions on saturday said they would meet their german colleagues in frankfurt on may 13 to discuss the takeover . nk , sp / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they claimed they wanted to liberate athens and greece from what they described as " hordes of illegal immigrants " .
they unrolled a huge greek flag and banners calling for the " departure of foreigners from greece " and claiming " foreigners equal crime " .
at the city 's old court of appeal , where 500 immigrants have been squatting for several weeks , dozens of protesters hurled rocks and firecrackers at the eight-story building which has no electricity , running water or sanitation .
others shouted " out of greece " and " leave greece for the greeks " .
the squatters retaliated by throwing stones from the upper floors of the building and riot police were called to break up the clashes .
counter-protest triggers further violence further fighting broke out between the neo-nazis and a group of anarchists , as police struggled to separate the two sides .
in a counter-protest , the young anarchists protested against the extremists ' demonstration , which they termed a " racist gathering " .
they set fire to garbage cans and cars .
there were no injuries but at least two people were arrested .
the clashes followed a call from rights groups for the greek government to abandon a planned police operation , that would see the immigrants expelled from the old courthouse .
they suggested instead the building be cleaned until appropriate alternative lodging can be found .

germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper reported that washington had provided berlin with a list of nine chinese muslims , members of the uighur ethnic group , that it hoped germany would offer refuge to .
" the information that we 've received so far from washington is insufficient for us to take a decision on whether to accept any one of the cases , " schaueble told the paper . the minister said a number of concerns needed to be addressed before germany could take a decision on whether to accept the detainees .
" first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat because this is a worry of many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them on ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? " he said . bavarian minister rejects uighur detainees bild reported that bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann is opposed to taking in any of the uighur detainees .
herrmann was quoted as saying that security intelligence showed seven of the nine uighurs reportedly being considered for resettlement in germany had been trained in camps of the east turkestan islamic movement -lrb- etim -rrb- and had contacts to militant islamist organisations .
" we do n't need those kind of people in germany , " hermann told the newspaper , adding that us demands were unreasonable .

tucked away on a hillside near the colosseum , it is a warren of buildings , some of them originating in the 4th century .
because it is still used by an enclosed order of augustinian nuns you can only visit the church and - if you ring a small bell - the ancient and wonderfully intimate cloister .
a document has come to light here of great significance .
it is an order from the pope during world war ii , pius xii , instructing the nuns to shelter jewish refugees .
" the holy father feels in himself all the sufferings of the moment , " he tells them .
" unfortunately with the germans ' entry into rome , which happened in the month of september , a ruthless war against the jews has begun , whom they wish to exterminate by means of atrocities prompted by the blackest barbarities . "
it goes on : " the holy father wants to save his children - also the jews " , and there follows a very precise list of those who should be protected , and how .
many of them are given pseudonyms , so the list includes a " mr ravenna , a rabbi " , who is to be hidden in the sacristy , and a mr viterbo and his father , " both jews " .
long-running row the accusation that pius did not do enough to protect the jews of rome or to speak out against the holocaust has been a running sore in jewish-catholic relations for many years .
it became even more sensitive as a result of recent progress in his " cause " , the process of advancing him towards beatification and eventual canonisation as a saint .
and pope benedict has become so concerned about the impact on jewish-catholic relations that he has put the matter on hold - even though evidence of the kind that has emerged from the quattro coronati convent has convinced the vatican 's own experts that pius did much more than he is given credit for .
it is a reminder that , despite a huge improvement in recent decades , there are still some very raw nerves in this relationship .
and there has been a sequence of incidents under the pontificate of benedict xvi which has made many jews and catholics nervous about the direction he is taking .
benedict has shown particular concern for catholics who have felt left behind by the changes in the modern church .
he has , for example , made it easier for people to hear mass in the old tridentine rite .
this ancient form of catholic worship includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of the jews , and even when benedict rewrote the prayer it caused grave offence in some quarters .
controversy over williamson and then there was the richard williamson affair .
bishop williamson is a member of an ultra-traditionalist sect which broke with the catholic church over reforms introduced in the 1960s .
earlier this year benedict extended a hand of friendship to the group - but he and his officials had apparently failed to notice that williamson is a holocaust-denier .
a quick trawl of the internet would have revealed an interview in which he said : " i believe there were no gas chambers .
i believe that the historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
when the interview came to light it caused consternation , and benedict was forced to apologise - something popes do not often do . "
-lsb- pope john paul -rsb- knew jews and judaism .
i think that for benedict xvi , this knowledge is cerebral rather than from the gut " rabbi david rosen his task on the visit to israel is not made any easier by the long shadow cast by his predecessor .
john paul ii made a hugely successful trip to jerusalem in 2000 , and is widely admired by jewish leaders and theologians for the steps he took to improve relations between judaism and the catholic church .
rabbi david rosen , who chairs the international jewish committee on inter-religious consultations in jerusalem , and who will meet pope benedict during this trip , says the key to john paul 's approach can be found in his friendship with jews as a young man in poland .
" it was an inner experience for him , " he says .
" he grew up in that environment .
he knew jews and judaism .
" i think that for benedict xvi , this knowledge is cerebral rather than from the gut and it 's a very positive cerebral attitude but it ca n't compare to that level of intimacy that was there for john paul ii . "
we have found a reserve of good will towards pope benedict among jewish leaders , and a real desire that this week 's visit should be a success .
but it is certainly the most challenging trip outside the vatican he has made since his election .

tucked away on a hillside near the colosseum , it is a warren of buildings , some of them originating in the 4th century .
because it is still used by an enclosed order of augustinian nuns you can only visit the church and - if you ring a small bell - the ancient and wonderfully intimate cloister .
a document has come to light here of great significance .
it is an order from the pope during world war ii , pius xii , instructing the nuns to shelter jewish refugees .
" the holy father feels in himself all the sufferings of the moment , " he tells them .
" unfortunately with the germans ' entry into rome , which happened in the month of september , a ruthless war against the jews has begun , whom they wish to exterminate by means of atrocities prompted by the blackest barbarities . "
it goes on : " the holy father wants to save his children - also the jews " , and there follows a very precise list of those who should be protected , and how .
many of them are given pseudonyms , so the list includes a " mr ravenna , a rabbi " , who is to be hidden in the sacristy , and a mr viterbo and his father , " both jews " .
long-running row the accusation that pius did not do enough to protect the jews of rome or to speak out against the holocaust has been a running sore in jewish-catholic relations for many years .
rome 's regina coeli prison , where jews were taken before being deported it became even more sensitive as a result of recent progress in his " cause " , the process of advancing him towards beatification and eventual canonisation as a saint .
and pope benedict has become so concerned about the impact on jewish-catholic relations that he has put the matter on hold - even though evidence of the kind that has emerged from the quattro coronati convent has convinced the vatican 's own experts that pius did much more than he is given credit for .
it is a reminder that , despite a huge improvement in recent decades , there are still some very raw nerves in this relationship .
and there has been a sequence of incidents under the pontificate of benedict xvi which has made many jews and catholics nervous about the direction he is taking .
benedict has shown particular concern for catholics who have felt left behind by the changes in the modern church .
he has , for example , made it easier for people to hear mass in the old tridentine rite .
this ancient form of catholic worship includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of the jews , and even when benedict rewrote the prayer it caused grave offence in some quarters .
controversy over williamson and then there was the richard williamson affair .
bishop williamson is a member of an ultra-traditionalist sect which broke with the catholic church over reforms introduced in the 1960s .
earlier this year benedict extended a hand of friendship to the group - but he and his officials had apparently failed to notice that williamson is a holocaust-denier .
a quick trawl of the internet would have revealed an interview in which he said : " i believe there were no gas chambers .
i believe that the historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
when the interview came to light it caused consternation , and benedict was forced to apologise - something popes do not often do .
-lsb- pope john paul -rsb- knew jews and judaism .
i think that for benedict xvi , this knowledge is cerebral rather than from the gut rabbi david rosen his task on the visit to israel is not made any easier by the long shadow cast by his predecessor .
john paul ii made a hugely successful trip to jerusalem in 2000 , and is widely admired by jewish leaders and theologians for the steps he took to improve relations between judaism and the catholic church .
rabbi david rosen , who chairs the international jewish committee on inter-religious consultations in jerusalem , and who will meet pope benedict during this trip , says the key to john paul 's approach can be found in his friendship with jews as a young man in poland .
" it was an inner experience for him , " he says .
" he grew up in that environment .
he knew jews and judaism .
" i think that for benedict xvi , this knowledge is cerebral rather than from the gut and it 's a very positive cerebral attitude but it ca n't compare to that level of intimacy that was there for john paul ii . "
we have found a reserve of good will towards pope benedict among jewish leaders , and a real desire that this week 's visit should be a success .
but it is certainly the most challenging trip outside the vatican he has made since his election .

tucked away on a hillside near the colosseum , it is a warren of buildings , some of them originating in the 4th century .
because it is still used by an enclosed order of augustinian nuns you can only visit the church and - if you ring a small bell - the ancient and wonderfully intimate cloister .
a document has come to light here of great significance .
it is an order from the pope during world war ii , pius xii , instructing the nuns to shelter jewish refugees .
" the holy father feels in himself all the sufferings of the moment , " he tells them .
" unfortunately with the germans ' entry into rome , which happened in the month of september , a ruthless war against the jews has begun , whom they wish to exterminate by means of atrocities prompted by the blackest barbarities . "
it goes on : " the holy father wants to save his children - also the jews " , and there follows a very precise list of those who should be protected , and how .
many of them are given pseudonyms , so the list includes a " mr ravenna , a rabbi " , who is to be hidden in the sacristy , and a mr viterbo and his father , " both jews " .
long-running row the accusation that pius did not do enough to protect the jews of rome or to speak out against the holocaust has been a running sore in jewish-catholic relations for many years .
rome 's regina coeli prison , where jews were taken before being deported it became even more sensitive as a result of recent progress in his " cause " , the process of advancing him towards beatification and eventual canonisation as a saint .
and pope benedict has become so concerned about the impact on jewish-catholic relations that he has put the matter on hold - even though evidence of the kind that has emerged from the quattro coronati convent has convinced the vatican 's own experts that pius did much more than he is given credit for .
it is a reminder that , despite a huge improvement in recent decades , there are still some very raw nerves in this relationship .
and there has been a sequence of incidents under the pontificate of benedict xvi which has made many jews and catholics nervous about the direction he is taking .
benedict has shown particular concern for catholics who have felt left behind by the changes in the modern church .
he has , for example , made it easier for people to hear mass in the old tridentine rite .
this ancient form of catholic worship includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of the jews , and even when benedict rewrote the prayer it caused grave offence in some quarters .
controversy over williamson and then there was the richard williamson affair .
bishop williamson is a member of an ultra-traditionalist sect which broke with the catholic church over reforms introduced in the 1960s .
earlier this year benedict extended a hand of friendship to the group - but he and his officials had apparently failed to notice that williamson is a holocaust-denier .
a quick trawl of the internet would have revealed an interview in which he said : " i believe there were no gas chambers .
i believe that the historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
when the interview came to light it caused consternation , and benedict was forced to apologise - something popes do not often do .
-lsb- pope john paul -rsb- knew jews and judaism .
i think that for benedict xvi , this knowledge is cerebral rather than from the gut rabbi david rosen his task on the visit to israel is not made any easier by the long shadow cast by his predecessor .
john paul ii made a hugely successful trip to jerusalem in 2000 , and is widely admired by jewish leaders and theologians for the steps he took to improve relations between judaism and the catholic church .
rabbi david rosen , who chairs the international jewish committee on inter-religious consultations in jerusalem , and who will meet pope benedict during this trip , says the key to john paul 's approach can be found in his friendship with jews as a young man in poland .
" it was an inner experience for him , " he says .
" he grew up in that environment .
he knew jews and judaism .
" i think that for benedict xvi , this knowledge is cerebral rather than from the gut and it 's a very positive cerebral attitude but it ca n't compare to that level of intimacy that was there for john paul ii . "
we have found a reserve of good will towards pope benedict among jewish leaders , and a real desire that this week 's visit should be a success .
but it is certainly the most challenging trip outside the vatican he has made since his election .
