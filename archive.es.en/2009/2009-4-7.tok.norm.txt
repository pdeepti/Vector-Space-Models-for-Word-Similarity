three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .
more recently , five people were found dead in similar circumstances in bursa , just west of istanbul . sje / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 07.04.2009 rwanda : why the international community looked away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are buried in the nyaza cemetery outside kigali on april 7 , 2009 , rwandans commemorate the 15th anniversary of the genocide against the tutsi minority .
the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

both chambers of the german parliament have already passed the bill .
the new law allows the government to seize shares by force if investors turn down its offer for the stocks .
it gives the government until june 30 to expropriate shareholders if it chooses .
conservatives sharply criticized the law , saying a forced takeover was comparable to communism .
but the government of chancellor angela merkel , herself a member of the conservative christian democrats , said it would only take control of hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- by force as a last resort .
the law has been opposed by the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us investor christopher flowers .
he owns nearly 24 percent of the bank .
last month , the government took an 8.7 percent stake in hre for 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79.5 million -rrb- via soffin , the agency responsible for distributing the money from germany 's financial markets stabilization fund .
hre said at the time that it was " a prerequisite for the intended recapitalization of hypo real estate " that the government gain full control .
hre posted a loss of over 5.4 billion euros in 2008 .
without government support , the bank would collapse .

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't even know how i scored that , but the most important thing was that the ball went into the back of the net , " adebayor told itv .
" we got a good result to take home and we are very happy . " the other quarterfinal matches take place this wednesday .

both chambers of the german parliament have already passed the bill .
the new law allows the government to seize shares by force if investors turn down its offer for the stocks .

but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .

but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

they were right not to , according to international experts . italian scientist giampaolo giuliani predicted weeks ago a serious earthquake was on the way and would have a devastating effect on the central italian region around l 'aquila . after analyzing concentrations of radon gas in the area , giuliani recommended residents leave their homes .
had they followed his advice , some of the more than 200 people killed in the april 6 earthquake may have survived . but his calls for an evacuation were denounced for spreading unnecessary alarm and officials from the national civil protection agency on march 31 reassured people seismic activity in the area was normal . " the tremors being felt by the population are part of a typical sequence , " the agency said in a statement from the previous week , adding that despite continuous monitoring there was no reason for alarm .
" it is important to underline that it is not in any way possible to predict an earthquake . " the head of italy 's geophysics institute also rejected giuliani 's predictions saying , " every time there is an earthquake there are people who claim to have predicted it . " bildunterschrift : rescue personnel continued efforts tuesday to find survivors buried under rubble pinpointing quakes still elusive though scientists understand the cause of monday 's quake - the continental plate under africa pushes toward europe - and can foresee what parts of the world are most likely to experience earthquakes , predicting when they will strike remains impossible . " we know where earthquakes occur in certain parts of the world , we know for instance that earthquakes occur down the spine of italy , " brian baptie , a seismologist with british geological survey -lrb- bgs -rrb- in edinburgh , told the afp news agency .
" but saying when and crucially how big they will be is beyond us at the moment . " researchers at the german research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- agreed with baptie . no correlation has been found between radon gas concentrations and seismologic activity , according to gfz seismologist rainer kind , who called the radon concentration and ultimate earthquake a coincidence . " it would only become a reliable method when it has repeatedly foreseen earthquakes , " kind told german public broadcaster ard .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv europa : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 07.04.2009 what lessons do you draw from the crisis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behind every crisis there is an opportunity .
we want to know what conclusions you have made in connection with the economic crisis .
what can and must be done better , and what changes are you making to your own life ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : sergio l. country : brasil behind every financial crisis there are financial interests .
as other moments in human history , a large part of the world population will pay the costs and another one part will continue living very well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : jürgen l. country : taiwan i should get prepared to tackle every crisis .
i am a freelance chinese-english translator .
since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .
that 's my example to get more opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed a. country : quatar the lessons from the global financial crisis resulting in the absence of the effective controls from world bank and imf for banking systems around the world and poor risk management analysis and monitor banking systems process through the government audit bureau in each country around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : khaled a. country : egypt i 'm 38 years old .
working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .
i am brazilian but i live in spain since 2004 , where i work towards a phd in law .
so i don ’ t work right now .
what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .

what can and must be done better , and what changes are you making to your own life ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : sergio l. country : brasil behind every financial crisis there are financial interests .

my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .

what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .

turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .
more recently , five people were found dead in similar circumstances in bursa , just west of istanbul . sje / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who oversees the funding of german competitive sports , has welcomed the coaches ' decision to come clean about their past .
in a written statement he described the move as " a signal that they were taking responsibility for east germany ’ s doping past " and " an important contribution to foster dialogue with victims . "

" -lsb- since 1991 -rsb- these coaches have been actively engaged in campaigns for eliminating doping from sport and have not been suspected of any wrongdoing . "
attempt to white-wash past sins athletes who were victims of the doping system in the former east germany say the coaches ' declaration is meant to put a lid on a simmering dispute over the practice under the communist regime and the involvement of current german coaches .
andreas krieger , a former east german shot putter who was forced to take anabolic steroids from the age of 13 , believes that keeping these coaches employed is an immoral act .
" seeing that these people can simply buy themselves out of their past with this statement , i can only speak of a grave violation of moral principles , " the 1986 european shot put champion told german broadcaster ard .
winfried hermann , sports affairs ' spokesman of the green party , pointed out that after german unification in 1990 many east german coaches involved in the communist doping system remained in their jobs .

despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who oversees the funding of german competitive sports , has welcomed the coaches ' decision to come clean about their past .

attempt to white-wash past sins athletes who were victims of the doping system in the former east germany say the coaches ' declaration is meant to put a lid on a simmering dispute over the practice under the communist regime and the involvement of current german coaches .
andreas krieger , a former east german shot putter who was forced to take anabolic steroids from the age of 13 , believes that keeping these coaches employed is an immoral act .
" seeing that these people can simply buy themselves out of their past with this statement , i can only speak of a grave violation of moral principles , " the 1986 european shot put champion told german broadcaster ard .
winfried hermann , sports affairs ' spokesman of the green party , pointed out that after german unification in 1990 many east german coaches involved in the communist doping system remained in their jobs .

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 07.04.2009 rwanda : why the international community looked away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are buried in the nyaza cemetery outside kigali on april 7 , 2009 , rwandans commemorate the 15th anniversary of the genocide against the tutsi minority .
the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .

they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain .

while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .

they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .

both chambers of the german parliament have already passed the bill .
the new law allows the government to seize shares by force if investors turn down its offer for the stocks .
it gives the government until june 30 to expropriate shareholders if it chooses .

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .

readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .

" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .

but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 07.04.2009 rwanda : why the international community looked away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are buried in the nyaza cemetery outside kigali on april 7 , 2009 , rwandans commemorate the 15th anniversary of the genocide against the tutsi minority .
the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .

" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .

istanbul is the last stop on obama 's maiden tour of europe as president . obama began his final day of an eight-day tour of europe by pledging respect to islam in a meeting with muslim , christian and jewish spiritual leaders in istanbul .
he then held a round-table discussion with university students .
on the question of turkish-kurdish relations , obama said that the kurdish rebel group , the pkk , was on washington 's list of terrorist organisations and stressed that terror against any nation was unacceptable .
he added however that it was important to advance the rights of minorities , including the kurdish population within turkey .
" -lrb- our -rrb- efforts will be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between turkey , the iraqi government , and iraq 's kurdish leaders , and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunity for turkey 's kurds . " difficulties in paying for climate change obama also raised the issue of climate change .
the us president said that reaching an international accord on combating climate change would be difficult because of political and economic hurdles .
“ this is going to be a big , big project , a very difficult one , and costly one , ” said the american president .
obama said that political leaders would face tough decisions on who would bear the costs for limited the production of carbon gases .
positive media echo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visits the blue mosque in istanbul in their tuesday editions , turkish newspapers praised obama 's address to the turkish parliament he held on monday .
during his speech , obama appealed for dialogue and inter-faith understanding , and stressed that “ the united states is not , and will never be , at war with islam . ”
approving of the message , the radikal newspaper headlined its front page “ we can be a model partnership . ”
turkish commentators have also praised obama 's tactful , political approach .
the hurriyet newspaper headlined its front page on tuesday with “ all of us have to change , ” referring to the way obama praised turkey for its domestic and foreign policy reforms in the mainly muslim nation over the past few years .
commentators are particularly pleased with the way obama successfully bypassed the contentious armenian genocide issue , saying he did not want to rock the boat as turkish and armenian leaders work towards normalizing ties .
ankara is a key us ally in the region between europe , the caucasus and the middle east .
the us 's wars in iraq and afghanistan have been unpopular in muslim turkey however , where they have been viewed as battles against islam .
obama 's trip to europe also included visits to the uk , france , germany and the czech republic he has now headed back to the us . wl / pfd , afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.04.2009 police investigate alcohol poisoning deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has a history of scandals involving contaminated liquor turkish police have arrested two men suspected of causing the alcohol-related deaths of three german school students in the city of kemer , on turkey 's mediterranean coast . the two suspects work as purchasing officers at the hotel the students were staying at when they consumed the contaminated alcohol .
three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .

despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "

despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who oversees the funding of german competitive sports , has welcomed the coaches ' decision to come clean about their past .
in a written statement he described the move as " a signal that they were taking responsibility for east germany ’ s doping past " and " an important contribution to foster dialogue with victims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb president thomas bach says the offenders will get a second chance approval also came from the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- .
in a statement , dosb president thomas bach said that the coaches would be given a second chance .
" -lsb- since 1991 -rsb- these coaches have been actively engaged in campaigns for eliminating doping from sport and have not been suspected of any wrongdoing . "
attempt to white-wash past sins athletes who were victims of the doping system in the former east germany say the coaches ' declaration is meant to put a lid on a simmering dispute over the practice under the communist regime and the involvement of current german coaches .
andreas krieger , a former east german shot putter who was forced to take anabolic steroids from the age of 13 , believes that keeping these coaches employed is an immoral act .
" seeing that these people can simply buy themselves out of their past with this statement , i can only speak of a grave violation of moral principles , " the 1986 european shot put champion told german broadcaster ard .
winfried hermann , sports affairs ' spokesman of the green party , pointed out that after german unification in 1990 many east german coaches involved in the communist doping system remained in their jobs .
therefore this declaration was an attempt by sports officials and coaches to whitewash past sins .
east german medal winning machinery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an east german gold medallist at the 1972 olympics in munich since 1990 many east german coaches who initially denied any involvement in the communist doping program have been removed from their state-funded jobs after being exposed by athletes or the media .
an estimated 8,000-9,000 east german athletes received performance-enhancing drugs under a scientific program that ran from 1972 to 1989 .
during this time the tiny communist country , which had only about 17 million inhabitants , won 384 medals and came second in the medals standings in three of the four olympic summer games in which it took part . uh / pfd / ncy , rtr / dpa / sid send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .

the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .

unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .

the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal were lucky to be only 1-0 down at half-time the final goals came in the dying minutes . carlos tevez looked to have snatched victory for united , scoring in the 85th minute , only for mariano gonzalez to grab an 89th-minute equalizer . united manager sir alex ferguson described the result as " about right . " " the first half they were the better side , " he said .
" but to get a 2-1 lead with four to five minutes to go , you really should be seeing it out . " arsenal gain the advantage meanwhile in spain , arsenal secured an important 1-1 away tie with villareal ahead of their second-leg meeting . villareal scored first with a driving long-range shot by midfielder marcos senna in the 10th minute and were unlucky not to extend that lead with another shot by senna and follow up effort by joan capdevila . however , the gunners came back in spectacular fashion in the second half when emmanuel adebayor scored with a bicycle kick in the 66th minute . " i do n't even know how i scored that , but the most important thing was that the ball went into the back of the net , " adebayor told itv .
" we got a good result to take home and we are very happy . " the other quarterfinal matches take place this wednesday .

both chambers of the german parliament have already passed the bill .
the new law allows the government to seize shares by force if investors turn down its offer for the stocks .
it gives the government until june 30 to expropriate shareholders if it chooses .
conservatives sharply criticized the law , saying a forced takeover was comparable to communism .
but the government of chancellor angela merkel , herself a member of the conservative christian democrats , said it would only take control of hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- by force as a last resort .
the law has been opposed by the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us investor christopher flowers .
he owns nearly 24 percent of the bank .
last month , the government took an 8.7 percent stake in hre for 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79.5 million -rrb- via soffin , the agency responsible for distributing the money from germany 's financial markets stabilization fund .
hre said at the time that it was " a prerequisite for the intended recapitalization of hypo real estate " that the government gain full control .
hre posted a loss of over 5.4 billion euros in 2008 .
without government support , the bank would collapse .

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .

hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .

but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "

" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .

six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .

but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

both chambers of the german parliament have already passed the bill .
the new law allows the government to seize shares by force if investors turn down its offer for the stocks .
it gives the government until june 30 to expropriate shareholders if it chooses .
conservatives sharply criticized the law , saying a forced takeover was comparable to communism .
but the government of chancellor angela merkel , herself a member of the conservative christian democrats , said it would only take control of hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- by force as a last resort .
the law has been opposed by the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us investor christopher flowers .
he owns nearly 24 percent of the bank .
last month , the government took an 8.7 percent stake in hre for 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79.5 million -rrb- via soffin , the agency responsible for distributing the money from germany 's financial markets stabilization fund .
hre said at the time that it was " a prerequisite for the intended recapitalization of hypo real estate " that the government gain full control .
hre posted a loss of over 5.4 billion euros in 2008 .
without government support , the bank would collapse .
media reports said soffin is expected to make shareholders a takeover offer before easter . sac / msh / ncy , dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.04.2009 police investigate alcohol poisoning deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has a history of scandals involving contaminated liquor turkish police have arrested two men suspected of causing the alcohol-related deaths of three german school students in the city of kemer , on turkey 's mediterranean coast . the two suspects work as purchasing officers at the hotel the students were staying at when they consumed the contaminated alcohol .
three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .
more recently , five people were found dead in similar circumstances in bursa , just west of istanbul . sje / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he then held a round-table discussion with university students .
on the question of turkish-kurdish relations , obama said that the kurdish rebel group , the pkk , was on washington 's list of terrorist organisations and stressed that terror against any nation was unacceptable .
he added however that it was important to advance the rights of minorities , including the kurdish population within turkey .
" -lrb- our -rrb- efforts will be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between turkey , the iraqi government , and iraq 's kurdish leaders , and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunity for turkey 's kurds . " difficulties in paying for climate change obama also raised the issue of climate change .
the us president said that reaching an international accord on combating climate change would be difficult because of political and economic hurdles .

working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .

because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .

we want to know what conclusions you have made in connection with the economic crisis .
what can and must be done better , and what changes are you making to your own life ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : sergio l. country : brasil behind every financial crisis there are financial interests .

i am a freelance chinese-english translator .
since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .

working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .
i am brazilian but i live in spain since 2004 , where i work towards a phd in law .
so i don ’ t work right now .
what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .

" researchers at the german research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- agreed with baptie . no correlation has been found between radon gas concentrations and seismologic activity , according to gfz seismologist rainer kind , who called the radon concentration and ultimate earthquake a coincidence . " it would only become a reliable method when it has repeatedly foreseen earthquakes , " kind told german public broadcaster ard .

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i am a freelance chinese-english translator .
since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .
that 's my example to get more opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed a. country : quatar the lessons from the global financial crisis resulting in the absence of the effective controls from world bank and imf for banking systems around the world and poor risk management analysis and monitor banking systems process through the government audit bureau in each country around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : khaled a. country : egypt i 'm 38 years old .
working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .

what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .
i think this is the only thing i can do for now : acquiring knowledge and skills .
there is a global crisis and i believe that those who are more prepared when it finishes will have more opportunities to take a good job , to make a good work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed s. country : egypt fear of the future is the lesson of the crisis ... send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .
more recently , five people were found dead in similar circumstances in bursa , just west of istanbul . sje / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "

despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who oversees the funding of german competitive sports , has welcomed the coaches ' decision to come clean about their past .
in a written statement he described the move as " a signal that they were taking responsibility for east germany ’ s doping past " and " an important contribution to foster dialogue with victims . "

attempt to white-wash past sins athletes who were victims of the doping system in the former east germany say the coaches ' declaration is meant to put a lid on a simmering dispute over the practice under the communist regime and the involvement of current german coaches .
andreas krieger , a former east german shot putter who was forced to take anabolic steroids from the age of 13 , believes that keeping these coaches employed is an immoral act .
" seeing that these people can simply buy themselves out of their past with this statement , i can only speak of a grave violation of moral principles , " the 1986 european shot put champion told german broadcaster ard .
winfried hermann , sports affairs ' spokesman of the green party , pointed out that after german unification in 1990 many east german coaches involved in the communist doping system remained in their jobs .

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .

they were right not to , according to international experts . italian scientist giampaolo giuliani predicted weeks ago a serious earthquake was on the way and would have a devastating effect on the central italian region around l 'aquila . after analyzing concentrations of radon gas in the area , giuliani recommended residents leave their homes .
had they followed his advice , some of the more than 200 people killed in the april 6 earthquake may have survived . but his calls for an evacuation were denounced for spreading unnecessary alarm and officials from the national civil protection agency on march 31 reassured people seismic activity in the area was normal . " the tremors being felt by the population are part of a typical sequence , " the agency said in a statement from the previous week , adding that despite continuous monitoring there was no reason for alarm .
" it is important to underline that it is not in any way possible to predict an earthquake . " the head of italy 's geophysics institute also rejected giuliani 's predictions saying , " every time there is an earthquake there are people who claim to have predicted it . " bildunterschrift : rescue personnel continued efforts tuesday to find survivors buried under rubble pinpointing quakes still elusive though scientists understand the cause of monday 's quake - the continental plate under africa pushes toward europe - and can foresee what parts of the world are most likely to experience earthquakes , predicting when they will strike remains impossible . " we know where earthquakes occur in certain parts of the world , we know for instance that earthquakes occur down the spine of italy , " brian baptie , a seismologist with british geological survey -lrb- bgs -rrb- in edinburgh , told the afp news agency .
" but saying when and crucially how big they will be is beyond us at the moment . " researchers at the german research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- agreed with baptie . no correlation has been found between radon gas concentrations and seismologic activity , according to gfz seismologist rainer kind , who called the radon concentration and ultimate earthquake a coincidence . " it would only become a reliable method when it has repeatedly foreseen earthquakes , " kind told german public broadcaster ard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 07.04.2009 rwanda : why the international community looked away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are buried in the nyaza cemetery outside kigali on april 7 , 2009 , rwandans commemorate the 15th anniversary of the genocide against the tutsi minority .
the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : what life was like in communist east germany katarina witt , socialism 's most beautiful face east german stasi tried to recruit merkel as a spy typically ossi - typically wessi demolished treasures from east germany entertainment -pipe- 07.04.2009 east german comic celebrates 400 editions of slapstick adventure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abrafaxe characters embarked on adventures that were off limits for their readers they 've been goofing around in futuristic cities and ancient rome for over 50 years .
now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the mosaik comic characters , who provided imaginary escape to many in communist east germany , are celebrating their 400th edition . for many , the comic characters abrax , brabax and califax were east germany 's true heroes .
while the readers of the beloved comic book series were trapped behind the iron curtain , the cast of abrafaxe was off exploring distant lands . even before abrafaxe , east german comic readers had the digedags , which were created in the 1950s as a socialist response to mickey mouse , who was born in 1928 with the help of cartoonist walt disney . in 1955 , the first so-called " mosaik " comic book hit the shelves : 32 pages printed in color on pulpy paper .
the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

we want to know what conclusions you have made in connection with the economic crisis .
what can and must be done better , and what changes are you making to your own life ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : sergio l. country : brasil behind every financial crisis there are financial interests .
as other moments in human history , a large part of the world population will pay the costs and another one part will continue living very well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : jürgen l. country : taiwan i should get prepared to tackle every crisis .
i am a freelance chinese-english translator .
since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .
that 's my example to get more opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed a. country : quatar the lessons from the global financial crisis resulting in the absence of the effective controls from world bank and imf for banking systems around the world and poor risk management analysis and monitor banking systems process through the government audit bureau in each country around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : khaled a. country : egypt i 'm 38 years old .
working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .

what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .
i think this is the only thing i can do for now : acquiring knowledge and skills .
there is a global crisis and i believe that those who are more prepared when it finishes will have more opportunities to take a good job , to make a good work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed s. country : egypt fear of the future is the lesson of the crisis ... send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

we want to know what conclusions you have made in connection with the economic crisis .
what can and must be done better , and what changes are you making to your own life ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : sergio l. country : brasil behind every financial crisis there are financial interests .
as other moments in human history , a large part of the world population will pay the costs and another one part will continue living very well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : jürgen l. country : taiwan i should get prepared to tackle every crisis .
i am a freelance chinese-english translator .
since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .
that 's my example to get more opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed a. country : quatar the lessons from the global financial crisis resulting in the absence of the effective controls from world bank and imf for banking systems around the world and poor risk management analysis and monitor banking systems process through the government audit bureau in each country around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : khaled a. country : egypt i 'm 38 years old .
working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .
i am brazilian but i live in spain since 2004 , where i work towards a phd in law .
so i don ’ t work right now .
what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .
i think this is the only thing i can do for now : acquiring knowledge and skills .
there is a global crisis and i believe that those who are more prepared when it finishes will have more opportunities to take a good job , to make a good work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed s. country : egypt fear of the future is the lesson of the crisis ... send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he then held a round-table discussion with university students .
on the question of turkish-kurdish relations , obama said that the kurdish rebel group , the pkk , was on washington 's list of terrorist organisations and stressed that terror against any nation was unacceptable .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 07.04.2009 german athletics coaches admit east german doping past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german coaches were involved in the country 's systematic doping program five leading athletics coaches have admitted their involvement in the systematic use of performance-enhancing substances by athletes in the former east germany .
despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who oversees the funding of german competitive sports , has welcomed the coaches ' decision to come clean about their past .
in a written statement he described the move as " a signal that they were taking responsibility for east germany ’ s doping past " and " an important contribution to foster dialogue with victims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb president thomas bach says the offenders will get a second chance approval also came from the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- .
in a statement , dosb president thomas bach said that the coaches would be given a second chance .
" -lsb- since 1991 -rsb- these coaches have been actively engaged in campaigns for eliminating doping from sport and have not been suspected of any wrongdoing . "
attempt to white-wash past sins athletes who were victims of the doping system in the former east germany say the coaches ' declaration is meant to put a lid on a simmering dispute over the practice under the communist regime and the involvement of current german coaches .
andreas krieger , a former east german shot putter who was forced to take anabolic steroids from the age of 13 , believes that keeping these coaches employed is an immoral act .
" seeing that these people can simply buy themselves out of their past with this statement , i can only speak of a grave violation of moral principles , " the 1986 european shot put champion told german broadcaster ard .
winfried hermann , sports affairs ' spokesman of the green party , pointed out that after german unification in 1990 many east german coaches involved in the communist doping system remained in their jobs .
therefore this declaration was an attempt by sports officials and coaches to whitewash past sins .
east german medal winning machinery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an east german gold medallist at the 1972 olympics in munich since 1990 many east german coaches who initially denied any involvement in the communist doping program have been removed from their state-funded jobs after being exposed by athletes or the media .
an estimated 8,000-9,000 east german athletes received performance-enhancing drugs under a scientific program that ran from 1972 to 1989 .
during this time the tiny communist country , which had only about 17 million inhabitants , won 384 medals and came second in the medals standings in three of the four olympic summer games in which it took part . uh / pfd / ncy , rtr / dpa / sid send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .

working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .
i am brazilian but i live in spain since 2004 , where i work towards a phd in law .
so i don ’ t work right now .
what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .
i think this is the only thing i can do for now : acquiring knowledge and skills .
there is a global crisis and i believe that those who are more prepared when it finishes will have more opportunities to take a good job , to make a good work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed s. country : egypt fear of the future is the lesson of the crisis ... send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

they were right not to , according to international experts . italian scientist giampaolo giuliani predicted weeks ago a serious earthquake was on the way and would have a devastating effect on the central italian region around l 'aquila . after analyzing concentrations of radon gas in the area , giuliani recommended residents leave their homes .
had they followed his advice , some of the more than 200 people killed in the april 6 earthquake may have survived . but his calls for an evacuation were denounced for spreading unnecessary alarm and officials from the national civil protection agency on march 31 reassured people seismic activity in the area was normal . " the tremors being felt by the population are part of a typical sequence , " the agency said in a statement from the previous week , adding that despite continuous monitoring there was no reason for alarm .
" it is important to underline that it is not in any way possible to predict an earthquake . " the head of italy 's geophysics institute also rejected giuliani 's predictions saying , " every time there is an earthquake there are people who claim to have predicted it . " bildunterschrift : rescue personnel continued efforts tuesday to find survivors buried under rubble pinpointing quakes still elusive though scientists understand the cause of monday 's quake - the continental plate under africa pushes toward europe - and can foresee what parts of the world are most likely to experience earthquakes , predicting when they will strike remains impossible . " we know where earthquakes occur in certain parts of the world , we know for instance that earthquakes occur down the spine of italy , " brian baptie , a seismologist with british geological survey -lrb- bgs -rrb- in edinburgh , told the afp news agency .
" but saying when and crucially how big they will be is beyond us at the moment . " researchers at the german research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- agreed with baptie . no correlation has been found between radon gas concentrations and seismologic activity , according to gfz seismologist rainer kind , who called the radon concentration and ultimate earthquake a coincidence . " it would only become a reliable method when it has repeatedly foreseen earthquakes , " kind told german public broadcaster ard .

they were right not to , according to international experts . italian scientist giampaolo giuliani predicted weeks ago a serious earthquake was on the way and would have a devastating effect on the central italian region around l 'aquila . after analyzing concentrations of radon gas in the area , giuliani recommended residents leave their homes .
had they followed his advice , some of the more than 200 people killed in the april 6 earthquake may have survived . but his calls for an evacuation were denounced for spreading unnecessary alarm and officials from the national civil protection agency on march 31 reassured people seismic activity in the area was normal . " the tremors being felt by the population are part of a typical sequence , " the agency said in a statement from the previous week , adding that despite continuous monitoring there was no reason for alarm .
" it is important to underline that it is not in any way possible to predict an earthquake . " the head of italy 's geophysics institute also rejected giuliani 's predictions saying , " every time there is an earthquake there are people who claim to have predicted it . " bildunterschrift : rescue personnel continued efforts tuesday to find survivors buried under rubble pinpointing quakes still elusive though scientists understand the cause of monday 's quake - the continental plate under africa pushes toward europe - and can foresee what parts of the world are most likely to experience earthquakes , predicting when they will strike remains impossible . " we know where earthquakes occur in certain parts of the world , we know for instance that earthquakes occur down the spine of italy , " brian baptie , a seismologist with british geological survey -lrb- bgs -rrb- in edinburgh , told the afp news agency .
" but saying when and crucially how big they will be is beyond us at the moment . " researchers at the german research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- agreed with baptie . no correlation has been found between radon gas concentrations and seismologic activity , according to gfz seismologist rainer kind , who called the radon concentration and ultimate earthquake a coincidence . " it would only become a reliable method when it has repeatedly foreseen earthquakes , " kind told german public broadcaster ard .

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .

the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .

despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who oversees the funding of german competitive sports , has welcomed the coaches ' decision to come clean about their past .
in a written statement he described the move as " a signal that they were taking responsibility for east germany ’ s doping past " and " an important contribution to foster dialogue with victims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb president thomas bach says the offenders will get a second chance approval also came from the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- .
in a statement , dosb president thomas bach said that the coaches would be given a second chance .
" -lsb- since 1991 -rsb- these coaches have been actively engaged in campaigns for eliminating doping from sport and have not been suspected of any wrongdoing . "
attempt to white-wash past sins athletes who were victims of the doping system in the former east germany say the coaches ' declaration is meant to put a lid on a simmering dispute over the practice under the communist regime and the involvement of current german coaches .
andreas krieger , a former east german shot putter who was forced to take anabolic steroids from the age of 13 , believes that keeping these coaches employed is an immoral act .
" seeing that these people can simply buy themselves out of their past with this statement , i can only speak of a grave violation of moral principles , " the 1986 european shot put champion told german broadcaster ard .
winfried hermann , sports affairs ' spokesman of the green party , pointed out that after german unification in 1990 many east german coaches involved in the communist doping system remained in their jobs .
therefore this declaration was an attempt by sports officials and coaches to whitewash past sins .
east german medal winning machinery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an east german gold medallist at the 1972 olympics in munich since 1990 many east german coaches who initially denied any involvement in the communist doping program have been removed from their state-funded jobs after being exposed by athletes or the media .
an estimated 8,000-9,000 east german athletes received performance-enhancing drugs under a scientific program that ran from 1972 to 1989 .
during this time the tiny communist country , which had only about 17 million inhabitants , won 384 medals and came second in the medals standings in three of the four olympic summer games in which it took part . uh / pfd / ncy , rtr / dpa / sid send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .

a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .

working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .

because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .

banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .

it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .
i think this is the only thing i can do for now : acquiring knowledge and skills .
there is a global crisis and i believe that those who are more prepared when it finishes will have more opportunities to take a good job , to make a good work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed s. country : egypt fear of the future is the lesson of the crisis ... send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both chambers of the german parliament have already passed the bill .
the new law allows the government to seize shares by force if investors turn down its offer for the stocks .
it gives the government until june 30 to expropriate shareholders if it chooses .
conservatives sharply criticized the law , saying a forced takeover was comparable to communism .
but the government of chancellor angela merkel , herself a member of the conservative christian democrats , said it would only take control of hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- by force as a last resort .
the law has been opposed by the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us investor christopher flowers .
he owns nearly 24 percent of the bank .
last month , the government took an 8.7 percent stake in hre for 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79.5 million -rrb- via soffin , the agency responsible for distributing the money from germany 's financial markets stabilization fund .
hre said at the time that it was " a prerequisite for the intended recapitalization of hypo real estate " that the government gain full control .
hre posted a loss of over 5.4 billion euros in 2008 .
without government support , the bank would collapse .
media reports said soffin is expected to make shareholders a takeover offer before easter . sac / msh / ncy , dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

istanbul is the last stop on obama 's maiden tour of europe as president . obama began his final day of an eight-day tour of europe by pledging respect to islam in a meeting with muslim , christian and jewish spiritual leaders in istanbul .
he then held a round-table discussion with university students .
on the question of turkish-kurdish relations , obama said that the kurdish rebel group , the pkk , was on washington 's list of terrorist organisations and stressed that terror against any nation was unacceptable .
he added however that it was important to advance the rights of minorities , including the kurdish population within turkey .
" -lrb- our -rrb- efforts will be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between turkey , the iraqi government , and iraq 's kurdish leaders , and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunity for turkey 's kurds . " difficulties in paying for climate change obama also raised the issue of climate change .
the us president said that reaching an international accord on combating climate change would be difficult because of political and economic hurdles .
“ this is going to be a big , big project , a very difficult one , and costly one , ” said the american president .
obama said that political leaders would face tough decisions on who would bear the costs for limited the production of carbon gases .
positive media echo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama visits the blue mosque in istanbul in their tuesday editions , turkish newspapers praised obama 's address to the turkish parliament he held on monday .
during his speech , obama appealed for dialogue and inter-faith understanding , and stressed that “ the united states is not , and will never be , at war with islam . ”
approving of the message , the radikal newspaper headlined its front page “ we can be a model partnership . ”
turkish commentators have also praised obama 's tactful , political approach .
the hurriyet newspaper headlined its front page on tuesday with “ all of us have to change , ” referring to the way obama praised turkey for its domestic and foreign policy reforms in the mainly muslim nation over the past few years .
commentators are particularly pleased with the way obama successfully bypassed the contentious armenian genocide issue , saying he did not want to rock the boat as turkish and armenian leaders work towards normalizing ties .
ankara is a key us ally in the region between europe , the caucasus and the middle east .
the us 's wars in iraq and afghanistan have been unpopular in muslim turkey however , where they have been viewed as battles against islam .
obama 's trip to europe also included visits to the uk , france , germany and the czech republic he has now headed back to the us . wl / pfd , afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reports the young man lay in his bed for some 20 hours before anyone checked on him and realised he was dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .
it was definitely bought in the hotel , not , as some people say , from outside the hotel . "
turkey has a history of spurious liquors made by illegal home distilleries being sold in markets and restaurants .
in 2005 , 22 people died , mainly in istanbul , from a contaminated version of the turkish national drink raki , sparking a panic in bars throughout the country .
more recently , five people were found dead in similar circumstances in bursa , just west of istanbul . sje / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”

however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .

even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .

but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .

both chambers of the german parliament have already passed the bill .
the new law allows the government to seize shares by force if investors turn down its offer for the stocks .
it gives the government until june 30 to expropriate shareholders if it chooses .
conservatives sharply criticized the law , saying a forced takeover was comparable to communism .
but the government of chancellor angela merkel , herself a member of the conservative christian democrats , said it would only take control of hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- by force as a last resort .
the law has been opposed by the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us investor christopher flowers .
he owns nearly 24 percent of the bank .
last month , the government took an 8.7 percent stake in hre for 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79.5 million -rrb- via soffin , the agency responsible for distributing the money from germany 's financial markets stabilization fund .
hre said at the time that it was " a prerequisite for the intended recapitalization of hypo real estate " that the government gain full control .
hre posted a loss of over 5.4 billion euros in 2008 .
without government support , the bank would collapse .
media reports said soffin is expected to make shareholders a takeover offer before easter . sac / msh / ncy , dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

they were right not to , according to international experts . italian scientist giampaolo giuliani predicted weeks ago a serious earthquake was on the way and would have a devastating effect on the central italian region around l 'aquila . after analyzing concentrations of radon gas in the area , giuliani recommended residents leave their homes .
had they followed his advice , some of the more than 200 people killed in the april 6 earthquake may have survived . but his calls for an evacuation were denounced for spreading unnecessary alarm and officials from the national civil protection agency on march 31 reassured people seismic activity in the area was normal . " the tremors being felt by the population are part of a typical sequence , " the agency said in a statement from the previous week , adding that despite continuous monitoring there was no reason for alarm .
" it is important to underline that it is not in any way possible to predict an earthquake .

we want to know what conclusions you have made in connection with the economic crisis .
what can and must be done better , and what changes are you making to your own life ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : sergio l. country : brasil behind every financial crisis there are financial interests .
as other moments in human history , a large part of the world population will pay the costs and another one part will continue living very well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : jürgen l. country : taiwan i should get prepared to tackle every crisis .
i am a freelance chinese-english translator .
since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .
that 's my example to get more opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed a. country : quatar the lessons from the global financial crisis resulting in the absence of the effective controls from world bank and imf for banking systems around the world and poor risk management analysis and monitor banking systems process through the government audit bureau in each country around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : khaled a. country : egypt i 'm 38 years old .
working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .
i am brazilian but i live in spain since 2004 , where i work towards a phd in law .
so i don ’ t work right now .
what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .
i think this is the only thing i can do for now : acquiring knowledge and skills .
there is a global crisis and i believe that those who are more prepared when it finishes will have more opportunities to take a good job , to make a good work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed s. country : egypt fear of the future is the lesson of the crisis ... send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 07.04.2009 german athletics coaches admit east german doping past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german coaches were involved in the country 's systematic doping program five leading athletics coaches have admitted their involvement in the systematic use of performance-enhancing substances by athletes in the former east germany .
despite criticism they will keep their jobs , officials say . in a joint statement released on monday , five leading german athletics coaches admitted to having participated in administering " pharmaceutical substances " to enhance athletes ' performances .
" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "
second chance the coaches who signed the statement are all still active in the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- .
they include long jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who oversees the funding of german competitive sports , has welcomed the coaches ' decision to come clean about their past .
in a written statement he described the move as " a signal that they were taking responsibility for east germany ’ s doping past " and " an important contribution to foster dialogue with victims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb president thomas bach says the offenders will get a second chance approval also came from the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- .
in a statement , dosb president thomas bach said that the coaches would be given a second chance .
" -lsb- since 1991 -rsb- these coaches have been actively engaged in campaigns for eliminating doping from sport and have not been suspected of any wrongdoing . "
attempt to white-wash past sins athletes who were victims of the doping system in the former east germany say the coaches ' declaration is meant to put a lid on a simmering dispute over the practice under the communist regime and the involvement of current german coaches .
andreas krieger , a former east german shot putter who was forced to take anabolic steroids from the age of 13 , believes that keeping these coaches employed is an immoral act .
" seeing that these people can simply buy themselves out of their past with this statement , i can only speak of a grave violation of moral principles , " the 1986 european shot put champion told german broadcaster ard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 07.04.2009 rwanda : why the international community looked away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are buried in the nyaza cemetery outside kigali on april 7 , 2009 , rwandans commemorate the 15th anniversary of the genocide against the tutsi minority .
the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .

nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .

it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .

we want to know what conclusions you have made in connection with the economic crisis .
what can and must be done better , and what changes are you making to your own life ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : sergio l. country : brasil behind every financial crisis there are financial interests .
as other moments in human history , a large part of the world population will pay the costs and another one part will continue living very well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : jürgen l. country : taiwan i should get prepared to tackle every crisis .
i am a freelance chinese-english translator .
since there are fewer cases now , i do my best to improve german to get other cases and practice swimming to be a coach .
that 's my example to get more opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed a. country : quatar the lessons from the global financial crisis resulting in the absence of the effective controls from world bank and imf for banking systems around the world and poor risk management analysis and monitor banking systems process through the government audit bureau in each country around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : khaled a. country : egypt i 'm 38 years old .
working in germany for an international position as market development manager .
my take away for the crisis : 1 .
people need to be careful on the loans they make and not to look only for more luxury life with no clear assessment of the associated risks .
2 .
the banking system need a major reform .
3 .
it is a potential opportunity for start-up companies with good ideas to establish their business as they may have a cost advantage of the solution they will offer as opposed to large companies as the overheads will be far lower .
4 .
good opportunity for financially stable companies to invest in r & d or acquisition of other smaller or financially affected companies .
5 .
it may be an opportunity for some companies to rework their portfolio of product to adjust their cost and prices to the market and may address different market segment .
6 .
it is a high potential opportunity for countries with high financial capabilities -lrb- like the gulf countries -rrb- to overtake some european / american companies and start to transfer the know-how to the middle east region for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : arthur k. country : uganda true , opportunity knocks during a time of crisis and this economic is not any different .
to start with i am increasing my savings by increasing my portfolios to spread the risk .
because i learnt from different electronic media and publications that the situation will get better i taking advantage of this to increase my saving .
it has also helped me to pursue the issue of mortgages further .
banks in uganda are revisiting their lending rates since their biggest clientele nationals in the diaspora are spending less therefore they are concentrating more on the local market .
this means with the right negotiation and positioning i can start owning a house when the rates are being revised from 19 % to 11 % hopefully . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : helga maria s. country : spain my name is helga .
i am brazilian but i live in spain since 2004 , where i work towards a phd in law .
so i don ’ t work right now .
what lessons do i draw from the crisis ?
it proves once again that there ’ s no such thing as security in life .
accumulating money definitely isn ’ t the best thing to do .
knowledge is the only thing that can ’ t be stolen from you .
of course , " knowing is not enough ; we must apply " , as goethe said .
what i do , apart from my law studies , is to learn german and try to improve my english .
i think this is the only thing i can do for now : acquiring knowledge and skills .
there is a global crisis and i believe that those who are more prepared when it finishes will have more opportunities to take a good job , to make a good work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mohamed s. country : egypt fear of the future is the lesson of the crisis ... send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

three other service staff members from the bar and restaurant were taken in for questioning , but were later released .
turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .
german authorities probe deaths medical authorities have classified the deaths " unnatural " , which means autopsies have been ordered while german state prosecutors conduct a preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
investigators are eager to answer two pressing questions .
one is whether the death of the first student could have been prevented .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of the students were evacuated from turkey to germany in a special aircraft the other question is where the alcohol really came from .
initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .
what they were given was pure poison .

turkish media report that the hotel bought its spirits from a local company named germiyan pazarlama .
investigators took 37 samples from products sold by the firm and found several contained high levels of methanol .
detectives have so far been unable to find the firm 's owner and fear he has fled .
ineffective alcohol ban the students involved in the poisoning were part of a school group from the mortzfeld vocational college in the northern german city of luebeck .
teachers had ordered them to stay away from alcohol , but seven students fell ill after drinking vodka on march 26 .
some of their beverages were apparently laced with methanol or industrial alcohol , which is toxic in large quantities .
the group only realised something was wrong when one of the students , a 21-year-old man , was found dead in his room .
six other students were hospitalised .
while four of them recovered , two teenagers who had fallen into a coma were flown back to germany for specialist care .
after 12 days in a coma , doctors at the university clinic in luebeck found the methanol had caused severe and irreversible brain damage and pronounced them clinically dead .

initial comments from the students involved suggested the victims may have bought the tainted spirits at a market outside the hotel grounds .
but the mother of one the youths who survived the poisoning says her son and his friends paid 25 euros for the drinks at the hotel bar .
" they definitely bought a sealed bottle of vodka , thinking they were drinking vodka and cola , " she told german public broadcaster ndr .

" we worked until 1990 as senior coaches in the gdr sports system , " the statement says , " and our prime task was to achieve international success , notably by winning medals . "
" we felt legitimized by state policy , and any refusal of these practices would have resulted in our exclusion from competitive sports and loss of employment . "
the coaches also said that in hindsight they had made " a mistake , " and that they were " very affected by , and extremely regretful , if athletes had damaged their health through the use of drugs . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.04.2009 merkel cuts short afghanistan troop visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poor weather prevented chancellor merkel from flying to the german base at feyzabad after meeting german troops in kunduz and mazar-e-sharif , chancellor angela merkel had planned to visit a third base in feyzabad on tuesday , but heavy cloud in the mountainous region made the helicopter flight too risky . the decision means merkel embarked on their return flight to germany a number of hours earlier than planned .
merkel 's two-day schedule , which was kept secret for security reasons , allowed her to discuss reconstruction projects and visit some of the 3,800 german soldiers deployed as part of the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the first stop on the itinerary was kunduz , where merkel and defense minister franz josef jung received a preliminary security briefing on monday .
following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following presentations on the work conducted by the provincial reconstruction team in kunduz , merkel flew roughly 150 kilometers west to another german base at mazar-e-sharif .
rocket attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bases in afghanistan are often targeted in rocket attacks just 20 minutes after her helicopter left kunduz , militants fired two rockets at the german base .
the missiles landed outside the perimeter fence and caused neither casualties nor damage .
a statement released by the taliban said its fighters launched the attack because knew the chancellor was in the camp , but bundeswehr officials in afghanistan have described the claim as " ridiculous " .
militants have conducted similar attacks against the german base in kunduz on nine occasions this year , but have failed to cause any casualties .
nato boost merkel 's afghanistan visit came just days after nato leaders agreed to alter their strategy there to boost reconstruction efforts while maintaining combat operations against taliban militants .
while us president barack obama called on the alliance to commit more funding and troops to afghanistan , merkel confirmed that berlin would deploy an additional 600 soldiers to help secure presidential elections in august .
the decision was actually reached last autumn , when germany 's lower house of parliament approved a bill raising the maximum number of bundeswehr troops that can be sent to afghanistan to 4,500 .
unpopular mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany must help afghan forces defend themselves despite obama 's praise for germany 's commitment to nato and afghanistan , merkel appears reluctant to further increase the number of german troops deployed with isaf .
the nato-led mission , which has seen 30 bundeswehr soldiers killed to date , is highly unpopular among german voters , and merkel is facing a federal election in september .
" at the moment i do n't see any need to expand our commitment here , " she told german public broadcaster zdf during an interview in mazar-i-sharif on monday .
" we 're here to help afghanistan defend itself . " she said , referring to german efforts to train afghan police officers and soldiers .
kabul snub ?
unlike the chancellor 's last trip to afghanistan in 2007 , merkel 's schedule did not include any meetings with afghan officials in the capital kabul .
she did , however , call afghan president hamid karzai on sunday for talks on bilateral ties .
the president 's office says the chancellor raised concerns about a new law covering the nation 's shiite minority , which critics say oppresses women .
karzai has ordered a review of the law , which he signed last month , amid claims that it bans women from working or receiving an education without the permission of their husbands .
the afghan government has confirmed that the law is not in force and stressed it would be altered if a review found it contradicted women 's rights . sje / pfd , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .

they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .

the april 2009 edition was the comic 's 400th . with the digedags , cartoonist hannes hegen had managed to create a real " people 's " comic , which was nevertheless free of political doctrine and propaganda .
even today , the characters are well known across former east germany , though most of their fans are now middle-aged men . vicarious antics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mickey mouse had imitators on the other side of the iron curtain " we learned lots of scientific , historical and geographic things from the mosaik comic books , " one such older fan told deutsche welle .
" the stories took place in many different locations , and a lot of mosaik readers went to visit those places - later on , when it became possible .
readers found out that the comics were very accurate . " there was no propaganda and none of the everyday grey of socialism .
the digedags were colorful , wild and full of imagination - until 1975 , when hegen stopped drawing . shortly thereafter , the abrafaxe characters appeared in the same magazine .
they were wild too , but not quite as clever as their predecessors .
they were also more pragmatic and did n't stray as far from the gdr party line . nonetheless , abrax , brabax and califax became a success story because they struck a chord with the readers .
they had what nearly every east german dreamed of : an exciting life on the other side of the iron curtain . " looking back , i would say that i was practically in exile with the digedags and the mosaik comics , " said peter lang , a former artistic director of the bethanian art house in berlin , comics expert and mosaik collector .
" as a kid , it was n't really clear to me that they did n't have much to do with the world of the gdr . " no hidden agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosaik published the first didedag comic book in 1955 part of the mosaik comics ' appeal came from characters who spoke without falling into the party propaganda found in other youth magazines . " mosaik was n't an educational magazine , it would n't have been successful like that , " said lang .
" it was an adventure through education , the history of technology and the history of science .
and it was all combined with a lot of emotion and that 's how you could remember things .
you became part of that world . " in the mid-1970s , the comic had a circulation of 660,000 and it practically flew off the shelves . gigantic , intergalactic , utopian cities often featured in the storylines .
aerial railways and four-story intersections gave it a colorful , futuristic touch .
but the digedags also traveled back in time to cities like rome and venice , where they engaged in exciting slapstick adventures . cartoonist hannes hegen , born johannes hegenbarth , studied art in vienna and leipzig .
at the age of 30 , he drew his first mosaik comic - a visual representation of his dreams , as he would later say .
since he stopped drawing the comics , hegen has withdrawn to a home in berlin and no longer gives media interviews . landmark edition to celebrate the 400th mosaik comic this year , an exhibition on gdr comic figures is being planned in brussels , the world comic capital . according to the publisher , there are mosaik readers and fans in over 15 countries , but the characters remain relatively unknown in western germany . author : christoph richter / kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations now acknowledges its failure to intervene .
dw-world looks back at this international scandal . when the streets in rwanda began to fill with corpses 15 years ago , the world stood by and did nothing , despite the fact that the united nations already had peacekeepers deployed in the country .
the un security council prevented its troops from getting involved .
over the course of 100 days during that spring , 800,000 rwandans - mainly minority tutsis - were murdered by hutu militias .
since the end of the genocide , experts have been investigating the actions of the international community .
it 's now clear that there were sufficient warnings to have prevented the genocide - or to have at least reduced the number of victims .
two months before the outbreak of the genocide in rwanda , jacques-roger booh booh , head of the united nations assistance mission for rwanda -lrb- unamir -rrb- , sent a cable to un headquarters in new york .
he wrote that the security situation was deteriorating on a daily basis , and reported " increasingly violent demonstrations , nightly grenade attacks , assassination attempts , political and ethnic killings . "
" we are receiving more and more reliable and confirmed information that the armed militias of the parties are stockpiling and may possibly be preparing to distribute arms to their supporters .
if this distribution takes place , it will worsen the security situation even further and create a significant danger to the safety and security of un military and civilian personnel and the population at large , " he continued .
his telegram was just one of many indications that a catastrophe was brewing in rwanda .
the un mission had been on the ground there since the end of 1993 .
its soldiers delivered reports of attacks on tutsis , weapons stockpiling by hutu extremists and secret training camps for militias .
un staff were n't the only sources of such information , says linda melvern , an investigative journalist from britain and the author of two books on the rwandan genocide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the genocide in rwanda " the belgian government was well aware of the risks in rwanda , and , in the weeks beforehand , pleaded with the us and uk diplomats at the united nations to reinforce the pathetic , ineffectual peacekeeping mission they 'd mandated for rwanda , " said melvern .
" the us and the uk refused aid at this crucial time in february 1994 for reasons of economy .
this failure , i think , sent a message to those planning the genocide that they could continue , knowing that the world would fail to react . "
bankruptcy of humanity when the genocide broke out on april 7 , 1994 , the un peacekeepers stood by powerlessly .
around 3,000 tutsis sought safety at the base of a belgian contingent in kigali .
but after 10 commandos were killed by forces from rwanda 's regular army , belgium decided to pull its troops out .
the tutsis were left with no protection , and thousand were slaughtered on april 11 on a hillside called nyanza .
it 's on this hillside that rwanda is holding ceremonies to mark the 15th anniversary of the genocide .
" nyanza is the failure of the international community , it 's the bankruptcy of the whole of humanity , " said benoit kaboyi , executive secretary of ibuka , the country 's main organization of genocide survivors .
for melvern , the failure to prevent the killings was also attributable to the lack of media coverage .
" the whole focus at the time was on the former yugoslavia , " she said .
" when the genocide began 15 years ago , the balkans were being bombed and the whole focus of the -lsb- un -rsb- security council was on the former yugoslavia , as was the focus of the western press .
for the security council and for journalists , rwanda was not at the top of the agenda .
even when genocide was determined on april 29 , 1994 by oxfam in a press release , -lsb- british -rsb- newspapers hardly covered that story at all .
so it 's a media failure as well as a political one . "
the international troops in rwanda were only authorized to evacuate foreigners .
the force commander of unamir , canadian lt. general romeo dallaire pushed repeatedly for permission to deploy troops to stop the killing , but he was consistently refused .
at the time , western politicians even refrained from describing events in rwanda as genocide .
then us president bill clinton instead called it a " tribal war . "
former un secretary general kofi annan , who in 1994 was serving as the head of un peacekeeping operations , issued a statement 10 years after the genocide saying he should have done more to stop it .
" we must never forget our collective failure to protect at least 800,000 defenseless men , women , children who perished in rwanda 10 years ago , " annan said .
" we must acknowledge our responsibility for not having done more to prevent or stop the genocide . "
wounds still not healed fifteen years on , the wounds many rwandans suffered have still not healed .
one issue for survivors is giving the dead a fitting burial .
at the height of the genocide , the bodies of up to 20,000 victims floated downriver to southern uganda , where they were hurriedly buried in mass graves .
now , they will be exhumed and re-buried in a ceremony , the kampala-based central broadcasting service radio quoted rwandan diplomats as saying .
then there is the issue of the perpetrators of the genocide , many of whom are still at large in africa , europe and north america .
hundreds of suspects sought for their involvement in the killings by the tanzania-based international criminal tribunal on rwanda -lrb- ictr -rrb- are living either under false identities or , sometimes in the open , as political refugees .
the government in kigali , which has been led by president paul kagame since his tutsi rebel group took over in the aftermath of the genocide , says foreign governments often do n't respond to extradition requests .
the governments of france and canada , for example , have refused to extradite suspects to kigali because they believe the rwandan courts that convicted them failed to meet international standards .
" that sends the wrong message to criminals , " paulin nteziryayo of page-rwanda , an organization formed to aid genocide survivors , told the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruandan communities have tried thousands of people suspected of taking part in the genocide while the survivors try to move on with their lives and deal with the trauma inflicted by those 100 days in the spring of 1994 , survivor associations claim that , for many , the terror still has n't ended .
in parts of the country , tutsis continue to suffer intimidation or are killed by their former foes says ibuka head benoit kaboyi .
" genocide survivors are still being massacred in rwandan interior regions , " kaboyi told afp .
" you can not hush up these killings by attributing them to the settling of scores within clans . "
as for the international community , some observers say it still has n't learned from rwanda .
general dallaire , for example , is one of many voices accusing western countries of once again watching as the next genocide in africa unfolds - namely , the conflict in darfur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 07.04.2009 obama 's first european report card : good effort but could try harder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made an impression in europe , but experts wanted more as expected , us president barack obama took his first european tour in his charismatic stride .
but while most experts call the visit a success , some warned that europe wo n't always be this accommodating . the british were more concerned about michelle obama draping an affectionate arm around the queen ; the french stopped moaning about turkey and the proposed us injection of huge amounts of cash into the world economy just long enough to trade fashion gossip on the first lady 's meeting with carla bruni-sarkozy , while the germans merely sulked and turned a deaf ear to anything with the word " afghanistan " in it .
but amid all the talk of designer gowns , inappropriate touching of monarchs and minor tantrums , most experts say that president barack obama 's first european tour was , on the whole , a political success .
" it was very successful but it is still to be seen if that success will endure , " stefani weiss , project manager for european foreign and security policy at the bertelsmann foundation , told deutsche welle .
" it was outstandingly successful in winning over the crowds in europe which all seemed to appreciate obama 's new charismatic style of politics ; the public appreciated his vision and dedication to work for a better world .
in regards to the politicians , they also liked the new style , but maybe they are starting to show a little ambivalence towards it . "
" obama 's visit was reasonably successful considering he still does n't have half his national security team in place , and a lot of the policies required to develop what us policy should be towards europe have n't been fleshed out , " said daniel korski , senior policy fellow on transatlantic relations at the european center for foreign relations .
" more came out of the visit than was expected and obama played a key role in all the negotiations .
okay , so we 're not out of the financial crisis , but none of the expected spats that everyone was worried about actually materialized . "
europeans eager for a new start with the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush had few friends in europe during his presidency european observers were particularly interested as to how the new president approached his negotiations with their leaders , baring in mind how divisive his predecessor 's policies were on the continent .
but although obama charmed europe 's leaders and teased them with hints of things to come , he failed to deliver any assurances on how his administration will approach us-europe relations in the future .
" i think it 's too early to tell how the obama administration is going to approach relations with the eu , " said korski .
" some of the bandwidth of us-eu relations certainly needs to be beefed-up and we have yet to see the kind of steps required to do that .
we 're still in the very early days of this administration and it 'll take some time before they can fully develop what 's needed for the us-eu relationship . "
weiss believes that obama showed a real commitment to the transatlantic alliance , and although there were no concrete declarations , she was optimistic on the future of relations .
" the great rifts have not been overcome , but he has the right approach and it seems that , after a long time , the europeans and us can work towards a better world together , " she said .
" however , he has n't solved a single problem yet .
but through his approach he has overcome some distrust , and the europeans are prepared to work with him .
also , obama is very demanding and he has put the europeans under stress to deliver .
they ca n't stand by and argue anymore , they have to do their work . "
obama gets a taste of ' old europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy had issues with some obama policies despite his best efforts to reassure the europeans that the new boss is nothing like the old boss , obama did manage to rile those countries which had been the bane of bush 's tenure , those countries which former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once infamously referred to as " old europe . "
but while france and germany stamped their feet over stimulus packages and obama 's support for turkey 's bid for eu membership , experts reject the idea of a return to the dark days of the bush administration 's relations with paris and berlin .
" i do n't think obama will have the same type of problems as bush did with france and germany unless he insists on absolute conformity with american policies - and the tone of his visit suggests that he wo n't , " said dana allin , senior fellow on transatlantic affairs at the international institute for strategic studies .
daniel korski agrees .
" i think it 'll be a fundamentally different relationship to that between europe and the bush administration , " he said .
" but saying that , we saw france and germany riled by obama 's speech about the role of turkey in the eu , so there will be tension .
the fact is that the us has seen itself as a european power for the past 60 years .
what we do n't know is whether obama still sees the us as a european power , and if he does n't , then what does that mean for the kind of relations we need to have ? ”
another area of potential conflict between europe and washington materialized during one of the obama tour 's most surprising successes .
while extending a hand to russia , some saw obama turning his back on european needs and interests , and europe 's relations with moscow and its neighbors .
reaching out to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev and obama reached an historic agreement " obama wants to have a functioning relationship with moscow in order to solve global problems , " said korski .
" they include iran , nuclear proliferation in general and getting logistical support for nato 's afghan mission , so all the conversations he had with medvedev went in that direction .
however , while the us wants to reset the relationship with moscow , this may lead to problems with the europeans .
us rapprochement with russia may come at a price for european interests which are more tied to the neighborhood . "
even so , obama 's offer of an olive branch to his russian counterpart was one of the diplomatic highlights of his european mission .
" obama is following the strategy of diplomacy where he 's not trying to start with a confrontation on the most divisive issues , but he 's trying to find areas where there are common interests and goals and to get back into the habit of cooperating on these , " said allin .
" the us and russia have committed themselves to finding a replacement to the arms control treaty which is about to expire .
that was the most substantial and important thing to come out of obama 's meeting with medvedev .
the atmosphere was good , but they also came out with something tangible , a pledge to pursue a nuclear-free world through a new arms control agreement . "
however , allin stresses , this does not mean that the us and russia have resolved other contentious issues such as nato 's eastern enlargement or the planned us missile defense shield in europe .
while the us president was widely praised for his approach to russia and his contribution to the g20 financial discussions in london , obama 's first nato summit was seen as more of a good start than a reason to celebrate .
obama faced with the challenges of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama made a good show at nato but faces a tough job " obama will have come away from the nato summit with the impression that the europeans are at least willing to give it a try and work with the us in nato , so he should be proud of what he achieved there , " said stefani weiss .
" he showed he was n't naive .
nato is an organization with 28 members and it is hugely difficult to accommodate everyone 's interests .
i think obama showed that he gets that . "
" at nato , i think he had more success on the afghanistan issue , at least rhetorically , than people expected , " korski said .
" the mood music was positive , except for that last minute scramble with the turks over the appointment of anders fogh rasmussen as the new general secretary of nato .
that could have been handled better . "
dana allin believes that obama will find that future dealings with nato , especially with its european members , may not always be so cordial .
" there may be areas of tension on military issues in afghanistan , but obama probably got his answer to that when he visited as a candidate in july last year and learned that there was n't a lot more that the europeans , and germany in particular , were willing or able to do , " he said .
" but it could still cause some problems if us efforts increase and european efforts stay more or less flat .
saying that , the europeans are still hanging in there and taking casualties , so maybe afghanistan wo n't be as dramatic an issue between this administration and europe as everyone thinks . "

it was previously known that the braf gene was often damaged or mutated in melanomas - but not whether this was a cause or result of the cancer .
the latest study shows acquiring the mutation can be the first in a cascade of genetic changes leading to melanoma .
the institute of cancer research study features in the journal cancer cell .
melanoma the most serious form of skin cancer sun exposure is the main - and most preventable - risk factor , causing genetic damage to the skin around one third of melanomas develop from normal moles the rest develop on areas of previously normal skin warning signs include : two halves of a mole do not look the same the edges of the mole are irregular , blurred or jagged colour is uneven , with more than one shade mole is wider than 6mm it confirms that braf is a driving force behind the disease and could be the trigger that leads to skin cancer .
although the study was carried out in mice , the researchers said that melanomas which develop in the animals closely resemble those that develop in humans .
lead researcher professor richard marais said : " we know that excessive sun exposure is the main cause of skin cancer , but not much is known about the genetics behind it .
" our study shows that the genetic damage of braf is the first step in skin cancer development .
" understanding this process will help us develop more effective treatments for the disease . "
there are around 9,500 new cases of malignant melanoma and more than 2,300 deaths from the disease each year in the uk .
over-exposure to sunlight causes at least two thirds of all malignant melanomas .
reducing the risk spend time in the shade between 1100 and 1500 make sure you never burn wear a t-shirt , hat and sunglasses take extra care with children use factor 15 + sunscreen this excessive exposure damages dna and causes genetic mutations .
dr lesley walker , of cancer research uk , said : " there is lots of exciting research focused on developing new therapies that will block the function of mutant braf .
" a better understanding of the genetics of skin cancer can help scientists develop more targeted drugs with fewer side effects to treat the disease . "

melanoma the most serious form of skin cancer sun exposure is the main - and most preventable - risk factor , causing genetic damage to the skin around one third of melanomas develop from normal moles the rest develop on areas of previously normal skin warning signs include : two halves of a mole do not look the same the edges of the mole are irregular , blurred or jagged colour is uneven , with more than one shade mole is wider than 6mm it confirms that braf is a driving force behind the disease and could be the trigger that leads to skin cancer .
although the study was carried out in mice , the researchers said that melanomas which develop in the animals closely resemble those that develop in humans .
lead researcher professor richard marais said : " we know that excessive sun exposure is the main cause of skin cancer , but not much is known about the genetics behind it .
" our study shows that the genetic damage of braf is the first step in skin cancer development .
" understanding this process will help us develop more effective treatments for the disease . "
there are around 9,500 new cases of malignant melanoma and more than 2,300 deaths from the disease each year in the uk .
over-exposure to sunlight causes at least two thirds of all malignant melanomas .
reducing the risk spend time in the shade between 1100 and 1500 make sure you never burn wear a t-shirt , hat and sunglasses take extra care with children use factor 15 + sunscreen this excessive exposure damages dna and causes genetic mutations .
dr lesley walker , of cancer research uk , said : " there is lots of exciting research focused on developing new therapies that will block the function of mutant braf .
" a better understanding of the genetics of skin cancer can help scientists develop more targeted drugs with fewer side effects to treat the disease . "

homeless residents are staying in ' tent villages ' set up to house them as you approach l 'aquila , the city looks untouched by the powerful earthquake that rocked the town .
but as you reach the edge of the city , at the coach station there are hundreds of people huddled around rucksacks and suitcases .
these are some of the thousands who find they ca n't return to homes that are too badly damaged and it is only close up that you notice in fact that almost every building has been affected - lumps of plaster missing from facades , windows broken or missing altogether .
and then , a little further into town , the damage becomes more serious .
whole buildings have collapsed leaving a huge pile of dusty rubble and twisted metal .
it is impossible to tell what some of these buildings were before they were reduced to a pile of broken concrete .
but on the road in front of one of these buildings , some personal belongings have been salvaged .
a photo of an elderly couple toasting each other sits in a shattered glass frame .
a grey woollen shawl lies in the road .
covered in dust the intermittent heavy showers are turning the brick dust into a white sludge , but on top of the pile of rubble , dozens of weary looking emergency workers , all covered in dust , are pulling away bricks and broken pieces of wood with their bare hands .
meanwhile , a crane and diggers stand by and the crane lifts out of the wreckage what is left of a sofa bed .
bricks and debris fall away as the tangled metal rises clear of the wreckage .
shocked survivors are gathering in refugee camps outside the city two bodies have already been recovered from this building and rescue workers think five more people may be trapped inside .
they will work throughout the night in an effort to get them out .
the next 48 hours will be crucial in the rescue effort .
meanwhile , tremors still rock the town - one came just as i was writing the previous sentence .
it brings a brief pause in the rescue but then the wail of ambulances resumes and a fleet of emergency vehicles tears past .
and as evening fell , tens of thousands of people prepared to spend the night homeless .
tents have been set up in fields around the town .
but darkness did not stop the rescue effort .
five thousand firemen , soldiers and red cross workers battled on in the hope of pulling some survivors free .
