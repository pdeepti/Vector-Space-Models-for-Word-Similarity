" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .
governments " really do need to get down to serious work , as of now , " de boer said nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.03.2009 france , germany bolt eu doors to western balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when will the eu open its doors to balkan nations and turkey ?
seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

despite a severe thalidomide-related physical handicap , the singer has begun taking opera roles in recent years . back in 1977 , the music conservatory in hanover refused to accept the young thomas quasthoff on the grounds that his handicap kept him from playing the piano - a basic requirement for any music student .
instead , quasthoff pursued private voice instruction , which turned out to be to his advantage .
" at the time , it was a big problem , " quasthoff said .
" but in retrospect i can say , it was probably an advantage for me .
because a lot of what is taught at music conservatory is not very important for the career of a singer .
that means people waste a lot of time with things where i think an extra singing lesson or two in the week or in the month would help these students a lot more . "
beyond " beautiful singing " the baritone 's own artistic breakthrough came in 1988 , when he won germany 's renowned ard competition .
since then , he has made countless concert appearances , and has performed with conductors from seiji ozawa and simon rattle to daniel barenboim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff has succeeded despite his disabilities in germany , great lyric baritone singers have been few and far between in the past few decades .
two personalities have dominated the scene : hermann prey and dietrich fischer-dieskau .
prey represented a sort of post-bel canto ideal , bringing the aesthetic dimension of his voice to the fore .
fischer-dieskau , on the other hand , has had a more sober style .
as for quasthoff , he sees himself as the progeny of both of those very different artists , although he admits his artistic vision agrees more with that of fischer-dieskau .
" personally , it is very important to me to have a constant symbiosis between the music and the text , " quasthoff said .
" for me , there is often too much importance put on just ' beautiful singing . " '
focused on the young generation good training for young singers is especially important to quasthoff .
from 1996 to 2004 , he was a voice professor in detmold and , since 2004 , he 's been on the faculty at the prestigious hanns eisler academy of music in berlin .
" i think that in order to be good , in whatever profession , you have to work very hard , " he said .
" success is tied to hard work .
its no different for singers . "
quasthoff remains critical of modern music education .
for example , he says he regrets that bach cantatas and oratorios are so rarely practiced in school , even though they are part of the core concert repertoire .
" in my opinion , that really has to change in the next few years , " he said .
" because we have to admit it - many young people who come out of the conservatory today will have to make careers as concert singers , which is much more difficult than singing opera . "
a love for " lieder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff , right , was named " singer of the year " in 2004 in addition to oratorios , it 's the art-song genre known as " lieder " that is particularly close to quasthoff 's heart .
" just to give an example , one of the most renowned concert organizers here in berlin does n't have any ' lieder ' concerts on the program this year for the first time since i 've known them , and i think that 's terrible , " the baritone said .
in order to promote the genre among vocal students , quasthoff recently founded an international competition called " das lied . "
despite his fame and tight concert and teaching schedule , music is n't the most important part in quasthoff 's life .
in 2005 , he met the woman who is now his wife , a journalist named claudia .
" i think that people make music differently when they have an inner balance , " he said .
" claudia brings an incredible amount of stability and balance to my life .
i 'm freer , much more relaxed than before , more even-tempered , and only very seldom in a bad mood . "

despite a severe thalidomide-related physical handicap , the singer has begun taking opera roles in recent years . back in 1977 , the music conservatory in hanover refused to accept the young thomas quasthoff on the grounds that his handicap kept him from playing the piano - a basic requirement for any music student .
instead , quasthoff pursued private voice instruction , which turned out to be to his advantage .
" at the time , it was a big problem , " quasthoff said .
" but in retrospect i can say , it was probably an advantage for me .

fischer-dieskau , on the other hand , has had a more sober style .
as for quasthoff , he sees himself as the progeny of both of those very different artists , although he admits his artistic vision agrees more with that of fischer-dieskau .
" personally , it is very important to me to have a constant symbiosis between the music and the text , " quasthoff said .
" for me , there is often too much importance put on just ' beautiful singing . " '

from 1996 to 2004 , he was a voice professor in detmold and , since 2004 , he 's been on the faculty at the prestigious hanns eisler academy of music in berlin .
" i think that in order to be good , in whatever profession , you have to work very hard , " he said .

" because we have to admit it - many young people who come out of the conservatory today will have to make careers as concert singers , which is much more difficult than singing opera . "
a love for " lieder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff , right , was named " singer of the year " in 2004 in addition to oratorios , it 's the art-song genre known as " lieder " that is particularly close to quasthoff 's heart .
" just to give an example , one of the most renowned concert organizers here in berlin does n't have any ' lieder ' concerts on the program this year for the first time since i 've known them , and i think that 's terrible , " the baritone said .
in order to promote the genre among vocal students , quasthoff recently founded an international competition called " das lied . "
despite his fame and tight concert and teaching schedule , music is n't the most important part in quasthoff 's life .
in 2005 , he met the woman who is now his wife , a journalist named claudia .
" i think that people make music differently when they have an inner balance , " he said .
" claudia brings an incredible amount of stability and balance to my life .
i 'm freer , much more relaxed than before , more even-tempered , and only very seldom in a bad mood . "

despite a severe thalidomide-related physical handicap , the singer has begun taking opera roles in recent years . back in 1977 , the music conservatory in hanover refused to accept the young thomas quasthoff on the grounds that his handicap kept him from playing the piano - a basic requirement for any music student .
instead , quasthoff pursued private voice instruction , which turned out to be to his advantage .
" at the time , it was a big problem , " quasthoff said .
" but in retrospect i can say , it was probably an advantage for me .
because a lot of what is taught at music conservatory is not very important for the career of a singer .
that means people waste a lot of time with things where i think an extra singing lesson or two in the week or in the month would help these students a lot more . "
beyond " beautiful singing " the baritone 's own artistic breakthrough came in 1988 , when he won germany 's renowned ard competition .
since then , he has made countless concert appearances , and has performed with conductors from seiji ozawa and simon rattle to daniel barenboim .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .

" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "

germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .

at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .

albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .

patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .

" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .

his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .

the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .

" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?

the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .

eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .
as a security measure , german police have temporarily reintroduced border controls ahead of the summit , which us president barack obama will attend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sleepy town of baden-baden wo n't be so quiet soon ...
left-wing militants , anti-war activists and right-wing radicals from across europe are expected to protest nato 's " imperialistic war policies " and its involvement in afghanistan .
some are also angry about france 's return to the alliance 's command structure .
flag controversy in strasbourg in strasbourg , police have tried to stop the display of anti-nato flags in the run-up to the summit , a move which has angered many .
" scandalous and intolerable , " said daniel-cohn bendit , co-president of the greens in the european parliament and a well known figure in french and german politics .
patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags like this - but bearing the slogan " no to nato " - have sparked controversy francois bayrou , leader of france 's centrist democrat movement , also condemned the police measures .

while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .
as a security measure , german police have temporarily reintroduced border controls ahead of the summit , which us president barack obama will attend .

left-wing militants , anti-war activists and right-wing radicals from across europe are expected to protest nato 's " imperialistic war policies " and its involvement in afghanistan .
some are also angry about france 's return to the alliance 's command structure .
flag controversy in strasbourg in strasbourg , police have tried to stop the display of anti-nato flags in the run-up to the summit , a move which has angered many .
" scandalous and intolerable , " said daniel-cohn bendit , co-president of the greens in the european parliament and a well known figure in french and german politics .
patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags like this - but bearing the slogan " no to nato " - have sparked controversy francois bayrou , leader of france 's centrist democrat movement , also condemned the police measures .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .
" and it will happen , " he added . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .

patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

" we will not pay for your crisis , " was the motto of the german campaign spearheaded by the anti-globalization network attac .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin decided it was time to bury capitalism demonstrators said banks must be held to account for the crisis , rather than allowing employees and the world 's poor to suffer as a result of the economic downturn .
a speaker for attac said roughly 15,000 people had come to the frankfurt demonstration .
several hundred police protected the entrances to office blocks in germany 's banking capital .
in berlin , police estimated that several thousand people were taking part in the protest .
on pamphlets and placards , the demonstrators called for solidarity and an environmentally sustainable global economic system .
the protests came ahead of a meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london on april 2 .
first of many rallies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events in berlin and frankfurt were heavily secured by german police the marches in germany echoed events in london the same day , where tens of thousands of people gathered from around the world to stage a mass protest .
braving cold and rainy weather the demonstrators were marching under the motto " put people first " in a rally and carrying banners saying " jobs , justice and climate . "
more than 150 trade unions , peace activist groups and environmental protection organizations were behind the demo taking place in hyde park .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 28.03.2009 ballack calls for german dominance against minnows liechtenstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack remains outspoken but his comments are intended to galvanize his team germany captain michael ballack wants a solid win as much as a goal-bonanza on saturday when his side tackles european minnows liechtenstein in a world cup qualifier following back-to-back home defeats . defeats to norway in february and england last november have dented the team 's confidence and the national team needs a convincing win over tiny liechtenstein which is 151st in fifa 's world rankings .
germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .
" and it will happen , " he added . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a severe thalidomide-related physical handicap , the singer has begun taking opera roles in recent years . back in 1977 , the music conservatory in hanover refused to accept the young thomas quasthoff on the grounds that his handicap kept him from playing the piano - a basic requirement for any music student .
instead , quasthoff pursued private voice instruction , which turned out to be to his advantage .
" at the time , it was a big problem , " quasthoff said .
" but in retrospect i can say , it was probably an advantage for me .
because a lot of what is taught at music conservatory is not very important for the career of a singer .
that means people waste a lot of time with things where i think an extra singing lesson or two in the week or in the month would help these students a lot more . "
beyond " beautiful singing " the baritone 's own artistic breakthrough came in 1988 , when he won germany 's renowned ard competition .
since then , he has made countless concert appearances , and has performed with conductors from seiji ozawa and simon rattle to daniel barenboim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff has succeeded despite his disabilities in germany , great lyric baritone singers have been few and far between in the past few decades .
two personalities have dominated the scene : hermann prey and dietrich fischer-dieskau .
prey represented a sort of post-bel canto ideal , bringing the aesthetic dimension of his voice to the fore .
fischer-dieskau , on the other hand , has had a more sober style .
as for quasthoff , he sees himself as the progeny of both of those very different artists , although he admits his artistic vision agrees more with that of fischer-dieskau .
" personally , it is very important to me to have a constant symbiosis between the music and the text , " quasthoff said .
" for me , there is often too much importance put on just ' beautiful singing . " '
focused on the young generation good training for young singers is especially important to quasthoff .
from 1996 to 2004 , he was a voice professor in detmold and , since 2004 , he 's been on the faculty at the prestigious hanns eisler academy of music in berlin .
" i think that in order to be good , in whatever profession , you have to work very hard , " he said .
" success is tied to hard work .
its no different for singers . "
quasthoff remains critical of modern music education .
for example , he says he regrets that bach cantatas and oratorios are so rarely practiced in school , even though they are part of the core concert repertoire .
" in my opinion , that really has to change in the next few years , " he said .
" because we have to admit it - many young people who come out of the conservatory today will have to make careers as concert singers , which is much more difficult than singing opera . "
a love for " lieder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff , right , was named " singer of the year " in 2004 in addition to oratorios , it 's the art-song genre known as " lieder " that is particularly close to quasthoff 's heart .
" just to give an example , one of the most renowned concert organizers here in berlin does n't have any ' lieder ' concerts on the program this year for the first time since i 've known them , and i think that 's terrible , " the baritone said .
in order to promote the genre among vocal students , quasthoff recently founded an international competition called " das lied . "
despite his fame and tight concert and teaching schedule , music is n't the most important part in quasthoff 's life .
in 2005 , he met the woman who is now his wife , a journalist named claudia .
" i think that people make music differently when they have an inner balance , " he said .
" claudia brings an incredible amount of stability and balance to my life .
i 'm freer , much more relaxed than before , more even-tempered , and only very seldom in a bad mood . "

" for me , there is often too much importance put on just ' beautiful singing . " '
focused on the young generation good training for young singers is especially important to quasthoff .
from 1996 to 2004 , he was a voice professor in detmold and , since 2004 , he 's been on the faculty at the prestigious hanns eisler academy of music in berlin .
" i think that in order to be good , in whatever profession , you have to work very hard , " he said .
" success is tied to hard work .
its no different for singers . "
quasthoff remains critical of modern music education .
for example , he says he regrets that bach cantatas and oratorios are so rarely practiced in school , even though they are part of the core concert repertoire .
" in my opinion , that really has to change in the next few years , " he said .
" because we have to admit it - many young people who come out of the conservatory today will have to make careers as concert singers , which is much more difficult than singing opera . "
a love for " lieder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff , right , was named " singer of the year " in 2004 in addition to oratorios , it 's the art-song genre known as " lieder " that is particularly close to quasthoff 's heart .
" just to give an example , one of the most renowned concert organizers here in berlin does n't have any ' lieder ' concerts on the program this year for the first time since i 've known them , and i think that 's terrible , " the baritone said .
in order to promote the genre among vocal students , quasthoff recently founded an international competition called " das lied . "
despite his fame and tight concert and teaching schedule , music is n't the most important part in quasthoff 's life .
in 2005 , he met the woman who is now his wife , a journalist named claudia .
" i think that people make music differently when they have an inner balance , " he said .
" claudia brings an incredible amount of stability and balance to my life .
i 'm freer , much more relaxed than before , more even-tempered , and only very seldom in a bad mood . "

despite a severe thalidomide-related physical handicap , the singer has begun taking opera roles in recent years . back in 1977 , the music conservatory in hanover refused to accept the young thomas quasthoff on the grounds that his handicap kept him from playing the piano - a basic requirement for any music student .
instead , quasthoff pursued private voice instruction , which turned out to be to his advantage .
" at the time , it was a big problem , " quasthoff said .
" but in retrospect i can say , it was probably an advantage for me .
because a lot of what is taught at music conservatory is not very important for the career of a singer .
that means people waste a lot of time with things where i think an extra singing lesson or two in the week or in the month would help these students a lot more . "
beyond " beautiful singing " the baritone 's own artistic breakthrough came in 1988 , when he won germany 's renowned ard competition .
since then , he has made countless concert appearances , and has performed with conductors from seiji ozawa and simon rattle to daniel barenboim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff has succeeded despite his disabilities in germany , great lyric baritone singers have been few and far between in the past few decades .
two personalities have dominated the scene : hermann prey and dietrich fischer-dieskau .
prey represented a sort of post-bel canto ideal , bringing the aesthetic dimension of his voice to the fore .
fischer-dieskau , on the other hand , has had a more sober style .
as for quasthoff , he sees himself as the progeny of both of those very different artists , although he admits his artistic vision agrees more with that of fischer-dieskau .
" personally , it is very important to me to have a constant symbiosis between the music and the text , " quasthoff said .
" for me , there is often too much importance put on just ' beautiful singing . " '
focused on the young generation good training for young singers is especially important to quasthoff .
from 1996 to 2004 , he was a voice professor in detmold and , since 2004 , he 's been on the faculty at the prestigious hanns eisler academy of music in berlin .
" i think that in order to be good , in whatever profession , you have to work very hard , " he said .
" success is tied to hard work .

quasthoff remains critical of modern music education .
for example , he says he regrets that bach cantatas and oratorios are so rarely practiced in school , even though they are part of the core concert repertoire .
" in my opinion , that really has to change in the next few years , " he said .
" because we have to admit it - many young people who come out of the conservatory today will have to make careers as concert singers , which is much more difficult than singing opera . "
a love for " lieder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff , right , was named " singer of the year " in 2004 in addition to oratorios , it 's the art-song genre known as " lieder " that is particularly close to quasthoff 's heart .
" just to give an example , one of the most renowned concert organizers here in berlin does n't have any ' lieder ' concerts on the program this year for the first time since i 've known them , and i think that 's terrible , " the baritone said .
in order to promote the genre among vocal students , quasthoff recently founded an international competition called " das lied . "
despite his fame and tight concert and teaching schedule , music is n't the most important part in quasthoff 's life .
in 2005 , he met the woman who is now his wife , a journalist named claudia .

instead , quasthoff pursued private voice instruction , which turned out to be to his advantage .
" at the time , it was a big problem , " quasthoff said .
" but in retrospect i can say , it was probably an advantage for me .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.03.2009 france , germany bolt eu doors to western balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when will the eu open its doors to balkan nations and turkey ?
seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .
as a security measure , german police have temporarily reintroduced border controls ahead of the summit , which us president barack obama will attend .

left-wing militants , anti-war activists and right-wing radicals from across europe are expected to protest nato 's " imperialistic war policies " and its involvement in afghanistan .
some are also angry about france 's return to the alliance 's command structure .
flag controversy in strasbourg in strasbourg , police have tried to stop the display of anti-nato flags in the run-up to the summit , a move which has angered many .
" scandalous and intolerable , " said daniel-cohn bendit , co-president of the greens in the european parliament and a well known figure in french and german politics .
patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags like this - but bearing the slogan " no to nato " - have sparked controversy francois bayrou , leader of france 's centrist democrat movement , also condemned the police measures .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .

in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .

swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .

his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .

" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .

at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .

at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .
as a security measure , german police have temporarily reintroduced border controls ahead of the summit , which us president barack obama will attend .

patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags like this - but bearing the slogan " no to nato " - have sparked controversy francois bayrou , leader of france 's centrist democrat movement , also condemned the police measures .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .

patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .
" and it will happen , " he added . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .

his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .

" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .
governments " really do need to get down to serious work , as of now , " de boer said nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .
" and it will happen , " he added . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .

while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .

the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .
as a security measure , german police have temporarily reintroduced border controls ahead of the summit , which us president barack obama will attend .

patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags like this - but bearing the slogan " no to nato " - have sparked controversy francois bayrou , leader of france 's centrist democrat movement , also condemned the police measures .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .
" and it will happen , " he added . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .
governments " really do need to get down to serious work , as of now , " de boer said nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .

the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .

kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?

the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .

europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .

europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .
governments " really do need to get down to serious work , as of now , " de boer said nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .

one of his main concerns is the predicted arrival of anti-nato anarchists hidden within their midst .
" what we are particularly concerned about is the participation of left-wing extremists who are ready for violence , " fromm said in an interview with reuters .
" we see a militant potential of some 3,000 people at the mass rally . "
and while fromm said a large international gathering like the nato summit is always at risk from an islamist terrorist threat , he stated that there is no " information on concrete plans for attacks . "
the alliance 's 26 political leaders will first meet in the german town of baden-baden to mark the anniversary of the creation of the north atlantic treaty organizationbefore moving on to strasbourg for the summit on april 3 and 4 .

left-wing militants , anti-war activists and right-wing radicals from across europe are expected to protest nato 's " imperialistic war policies " and its involvement in afghanistan .
some are also angry about france 's return to the alliance 's command structure .
flag controversy in strasbourg in strasbourg , police have tried to stop the display of anti-nato flags in the run-up to the summit , a move which has angered many .
" scandalous and intolerable , " said daniel-cohn bendit , co-president of the greens in the european parliament and a well known figure in french and german politics .
patrick wachsmann , a law professor at the university of strasbourg and a specialist in civil liberties , called the move " completely illegal . "
the controversy began when police visited homes of citizens who were flying flags with a rainbow logo and the slogan " no to nato " on them .
one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .
marie-george buffet , the secretary general of the french communist party , has used grosse 's experience as a rallying point and called people to hang the " no to nato " flag all over france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags like this - but bearing the slogan " no to nato " - have sparked controversy francois bayrou , leader of france 's centrist democrat movement , also condemned the police measures .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .

one resident , christian grosse told reporters police told him to remove the flag or they would .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 28.03.2009 ballack calls for german dominance against minnows liechtenstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack remains outspoken but his comments are intended to galvanize his team germany captain michael ballack wants a solid win as much as a goal-bonanza on saturday when his side tackles european minnows liechtenstein in a world cup qualifier following back-to-back home defeats . defeats to norway in february and england last november have dented the team 's confidence and the national team needs a convincing win over tiny liechtenstein which is 151st in fifa 's world rankings .
germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .
" and it will happen , " he added . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 28.03.2009 ballack calls for german dominance against minnows liechtenstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack remains outspoken but his comments are intended to galvanize his team germany captain michael ballack wants a solid win as much as a goal-bonanza on saturday when his side tackles european minnows liechtenstein in a world cup qualifier following back-to-back home defeats . defeats to norway in february and england last november have dented the team 's confidence and the national team needs a convincing win over tiny liechtenstein which is 151st in fifa 's world rankings .
germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .
" and it will happen , " he added . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .
enke , 31 , could certainly do with keeping a blank sheet as his club hanover are sliding down the bundesliga table .
a broken hand kept him out from october until the bundesliga 's late january restart after the winter break and he has conceded 31 goals in 15 league games - 11 in seven matches before he broke his hand and 20 in the eight since his return .
but with liechtenstein yet to score a goal after three qualifying games and having conceded eight - their single point so far came from a 0-0 draw with azerbaijan in baku last year - germany should have few problems .
and as ballack said ominously in light of their defeats to norway and england , germany " simply have to play better and put in a better performance " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 28.03.2009 ballack calls for german dominance against minnows liechtenstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack remains outspoken but his comments are intended to galvanize his team germany captain michael ballack wants a solid win as much as a goal-bonanza on saturday when his side tackles european minnows liechtenstein in a world cup qualifier following back-to-back home defeats . defeats to norway in february and england last november have dented the team 's confidence and the national team needs a convincing win over tiny liechtenstein which is 151st in fifa 's world rankings .
germany have not suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1956 and ballack says only a convincing win over liechtenstein will suffice .
the principality is just 160 square kilometers and the national team is largely made up of part-time footballers .
germany are top of their qualifying group and are unbeaten with three wins and a draw to give them a four-point lead over their main group rivals russia .
but the germans travel to moscow in october for the tie which could decide group 4 and ballack says it is crucial germany win both their next two games against liechtenstein and then wales in cardiff on april 1 .
" even if we do n't win these games by much , the result is very important , " said ballack .
" we must win these games and stay on course to be group leaders in the autumn when we travel to moscow .
" we have laid the foundations for some important games which , figuratively speaking , will decide the life or death of who reaches the world cup .
" we can play good football , but in addition we have to have discipline and order , " said ballack who will win his 91st cap on saturday .
" it is part of our mentality and if we do n't have it then we struggle , even against the likes of norway . "
germany lack dominance , claims captain ballack says germany must start asserting themselves against opponents - starting with liechtenstein in leipzig 's zentralstadion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and co. struggled against norway in february " we are lacking in dominance , " said chelsea midfielder ballack , who captained germany to their 1-0 defeat by norway in february .
" and recently results have also not been good , that is something we have to change .
" this has a lot to do with physical condition , but also with quality , ” he added .
" we are in a phase where we do n't put teams under enough pressure . "
ballack believes germany will qualify for south africa , but says the team needs to use games like these to make sure they can step up to the challenges they will face from the world 's top teams in the republic .
" we will qualify for the world cup and we will go past the group stage even if it gets tight .
but then come the matches against the big teams .
we will have to play at a higher level against the type of teams like spain , who we lost to at the euro .
" everybody must have an eye on the bigger picture - that is important .
" we must now set the foundations so that at the world cup we can win the so-called life or death matches .
this is what i am trying to point out as the captain . "
ballack unrepentent but more flexible ballack 's rallying call ahead of saturday 's game suggests that he will not shy away from speaking out , despite recent public arguments which threatened his role as team leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach and captain had a very public spat last year however , having sparked a media spat with coach joachim loew last autumn by accusing him of not showing senior players enough respect and loyalty , ballack says he has not changed his leadership style , but is more flexible .
" my leadership style is the same as it always was and i have n't changed it , " he said .
" i have developed it , but not changed it .
" i am always open to new ideas , but you ca n't always be right . "
and ballack says certain differences of opinion are healthy in a team environment .
" there must be some tensions in a team , which you ca n't always wipe away or smooth over , ” he added .
" things are n't always full of sunshine , there has to be friction at times as well . "
germany expect goal avalanche in leipzig happy or at each other 's throats , liechtenstein should present no problem to germany who have won all three of their previous meetings , scored 23 goals compared to their opponents ' three and it was 6-0 to the germans when the teams last met in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski will be looking to celebrate a hatful of goals with bayern munich veteran striker miroslav klose out with an ankle injury , stuttgart 's mario gomez will partner bayern 's lukas podolski up front with a flurry of goals expected from the home side .
at the other end , goalkeeper rene alder is out with an elbow injury and hanover 's robert enke will take his place in the germany goal for the first time since damaging his hand last autumn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.03.2009 bonn climate talks give obama 's green team first chance to impress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has high hopes for obama 's environmental policies the obama administration will enter the complex world of global climate talks this weekend in bonn amid a furious domestic debate about whether the us should be placing limits on the pollutants that cause global warming . as government negotiators begin a two-week meeting in bonn , germany , on sunday , obama 's team will be pointing to some immediate policy shifts by the administration that environmentalists have hailed as a dramatic change from former president george w bush .
some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

he made the case again at two days of talks with his european union counterparts at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic , which were winding up saturday .
kouchner himself recognised that several of his eu colleagues had reservations about the project of sending armed gendarmes to train afghan police .
" they are absolutely right " to so , he said late friday , stressing that questions remained about how the proposal would fit into the existing international efforts in afghanistan .
" should it be part of -lrb- the european police mission -rrb- eupol or side-by-side ?
should it be linked to nato ? "
the whole problem is to assure the gendarmes ' own security , as kouchner has said they would be working " on the ground , not in the schools , " one european diplomat said saturday .
that could involve support from the international force in afghanistan run by nato , while the eu would see such a force working in coordination with the existing european eupol mission to train police , which is expected to number 400 officers by june , he said .
" there would have to be a mechanism between eu and nato which would assure the eu 's visibility , " he added .
fears of complications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini , right , has concerns over kouchner 's plans but italian foreign minister franco frattini , whose country already has gendarmes in afghanistan and which could be asked to contribute to the mooted force , stressed the project would " complicate " things and that it was necessary to avoid initiatives that are not properly " coordinated " .
his swedish counterpart carl bildt underlined the difficulty in working out " how to coordinate -lrb- the force -rrb- with nato and the european police mission , " while remaining optimistic that a solution could be found .
bildt said those problems could be resolved ahead of a nato summit on the french-german border on april 3-4 , where afghanistan will be a central topic .
during the meeting on friday , eu foreign ministers said they were ready to increase their civilian action in afghanistan and economic aid for pakistan , to support a new strategy by us president barack obama .
" we are always prepared to do more , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg .
eu backs obama 's new strategy obama vowed friday to wipe out terrorists from pakistani safe havens , warning that al qaeda was plotting catastrophic new attacks , as he unveiled a sweeping new afghan war strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama launched a new afghan war strategy friday as part of those plans , the president called on us allies to join a major new civilian effort to stabilize afghanistan , and warned he would not turn a " blind eye " towards government corruption , which he said undermined faith in its leaders .
france was among those countries which welcomed the new us strategy , saying it was exactly what paris had been seeking for months .
" we are pleased to see that the united states are putting the full strength of their efforts and involvement into a global strategy , " said foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier .
" this is exactly what france has been calling for over the last months . "
french officials privately said obama 's strategy was not seen in paris as a " major strategic shift . "
" we are heading towards a doubling of afghan security forces , which means the afghans will be shouldering the burden of security , " a french official said on condition of anonymity .
europe agrees with afghanistan , pakistan view british foreign secretary david miliband said obama 's speech would " give concrete meaning to the idea that we are looking at afghanistan and pakistan together .. , and that they want to balance the civilian and military aspects of their work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban has huge support in areas of pakistan the eu has three non-military roles to play in the region , he told reporters .
" in afghanistan on the policing side and in pakistan on the economic side and in both countries also putting in place democratic governance . "
the new us strategy places stabilizing pakistan at the centre of the reframed us approach for fighting an unfinished and bloody battle against al-qaeda , which obama said was neglected during a us diversion to iraq .
pakistan 's mountainous border region with afghanistan is an al-qaeda haven .
miliband said obama 's strategy would " strike a very strong chord with the europeans , " who also see a strong link between afghanistan and pakistan .
europe 's own initiatives should be " integrated closely with the nato operations , we certainly do n't want more bureaucracy and new structures being created , " he stressed .
the civilian and military efforts will be discussed at a nato summit , obama 's first , on the french-german border on april 3-4 .
the eu is already planning two fresh civil projects in afghanistan .
it has agreed to send observers , if security permits , to observe local and presidential elections as well as increasing their police presence in afganistan from 250 to 400 officers .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said that more financial aid to afghanistan would also be announced at a conference on afghanistan in the hague next tuesday .
" we will certainly contribute to a civilian surge , having some more funds available , " she said as she arrived , adding that she might announce an amount at the hague .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .
speaking at the meeting in southern bohemia , slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar said he could see " movement " on the eu front , hailing the mediating role being played by rehn .
let us in , or else … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people in serbia are especially eager for their country to join the eu earlier on saturday , serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic had urged eu countries to welcome his country with open arms , warning that " things will -lrb- otherwise -rrb- become very complicated in the western balkans .
" i very much hope that we will confirm that the doors of europe are open ... and that the peoples of the western balkans can look forward to their european future , " jeremic said .
in a statement , the czech presidency of the eu said participants at the meeting in bohemia had " reconfirmed the european perspective of the western balkans . "
" we need to continue our policy of stabilization , whose other name is enlargement , " rehn said .
the czech presidency also vowed to show solidarity with the region in the face of the current economic crisis .
learning from history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband is in favor of widening the european union despite german and french reservations , some eu ministers sought to downplay fears that the current economic crisis was dampening enthusiasm for taking the relatively poor neighbours into the european club .
" i think we have got to make the argument that the european union should learn from its history and its history is that wider makes stronger , " said british foreign secretary david miliband .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also spoke out strongly against shutting out prospective candidates .
" if we were to slam the door in their face , not that i say that that will happen , it will have devastating consequences for the region , " he warned .
serious hurdles apart from the lisbon treaty , candidate countries still face serious hurdles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians are still fighting for the name of their country macedonia , which was granted candidacy status back in 2005 , has been unable to advance the membership process because of a long-standing dispute with neighboring greece over its name .
albania , bosnia-herzegovina and montenegro , meanwhile , all need to approve reforms designed to meet eu standards .
and the former serbian province of kosovo faces additional opposition from eu countries like spain , which do not even recognize it as an independent state .
at the meeting of eu foreign ministers in hluboka castle , a 13th-century mansion in southern bohemia that once belonged to minister schwarzenberg 's family , british foreign minister david miliband insisted that " the door to the eu has not been closed . "
lithuania 's vygaudas usackas , however , called on all candidate countries " to be very patient . " tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .

" relations would become very difficult indeed , " said czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" at one of our next ministerial meetings we would have to discuss what consequences the eu would draw from that . "
schwarzenberg did not elaborate but luxembourg 's jean asselborn said after the informal meeting of eu foreign ministers at hluboka castle in the southern czech republic that a long-mooted upgrading of eu-israeli trade and political ties depended on israel achieving a peace deal with the palestinians .
" we must tell the israelis that they are not allowed to walk away from the peace process ...
the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the upgrading process was always to be viewed from the perspective of the peace process having been completed , " asselborn told reporters .
" the foreign ministers must send a clear message saying that if this is not the case , the eu can not accept it , " he added .
" we europeans are insisting that whatever the weighting is in the two governments -lrb- israeli and palestinian -rrb- , the creation of a two-state solution must stand first and foremost , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .
" we should not always have to start from the beginning again - that is my urgent appeal . "
eu in the dark over netanyahu 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's plans for the palestinians are unclear israel 's hawkish prime minister-designate benjamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud party , plans to present his new government to parliament next week , following the labor party 's decision to join his coalition , which includes other right-wing and religious formations .
while he has shied away from backing the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip , netanyahu 's likud party agreed in a coalition deal with the labor party to respect all of israel 's international agreements - a formula that includes accords envisaging palestinian statehood .
the united states has warned that peace efforts , which have barely budged in recent years , will not be any easier under the hard-line netanyahu , who opposes the creation of a palestinian state .
last year the eu decided to enhance ties with israel but the idea has been a dead letter since the israeli offensive in the gaza strip earlier this year .
eu support guaranteed if benchmarks are met earlier the european commission pledged to support the new israeli government as long as it accepts certain benchmarks , including the principle of an autonomous palestinian state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso offered the eu 's hand - but with conditions " the european commission is looking forward to working with the new israeli government in pursuit of a common agenda , " the eu executive 's head jose manuel barroso said in a message to netanyahu .
" it stands ready to assist and support you in your search for peace , prosperity and security for the people in israel and the region , based on the vision of two states living side by side in peace and prosperity , " he said .
the europeans are the biggest donors of aid to the palestinians but they hold little sway over israel , which is backed firmly by the united states .
turkish president abdullah gul , on a visit to brussels , said he hoped that the new government would tone down the rhetoric that its parties have used while they were in opposition .
" if those statements are carried on in the government and they become government policy , then i have to warn that things would turn for the worse and it would create more suffering , " he told reporters .
" it is for that reason that i believe that the israeli leaders , when they form the government , will act responsibly . " nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 190 nations will launch a marathon of meetings , starting in bonn , designed to culminate in copenhagen in december with a new pact for curbing greenhouse gases beyond 2012 , when provisions under the kyoto protocol expire .
" the real negotiations are beginning here in bonn this weekend , " the un 's top climate official , yvo de boer , told reporters .
obama 's climate team , headed by todd stern , is scheduled to make a statement sunday at the start of the 11-day meeting .
" i hope they will set out the main principles that will guide the united states , " said de boer , executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- .
" bonn really is an opportunity to demonstrate that there no longer is a unilateral disdain of the united nations global warming negotiating process , " edward markey , a us democratic congressman who leads a house of representatives committee dealing with global warming , told reporters this week .
the bonn meeting comes as new new obama administration begins to implement its initial environmental policies both at home and abroad under great scrutiny and expectation .
domestic change hand-in-hand with global moves the us government 's environmental protection agency this week advised the administration that global warming could already be regulated under existing us clean air laws , and earlier this month said it would require us companies to report on their emissions levels for the first time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : todd stern will take point on the us climate team both moves represent a change of policy from the bush administration and are being viewed as steps toward one of obama 's key campaign promises : government-imposed limits on us emissions of greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming .
the united states and china are the world 's largest polluters , combining for nearly half of all global emissions .
per capita , the united states emits about four times as much as china .
obama has promised to cut us emissions about 15 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 .
many world leaders , including china and others in the developing world , are relying on obama to make headway on that promise before a global deal can credibly be reached .
on the election trail , obama vowed to match the eu 's mid-century objectives - the eu promises to slash emissions by 20 percent compared to 1900 levels by 2020 , and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries follow suit - but offered a more modest goal for 2020 of simply returning the us to 1990 level emissions .
this is a cut of around 14 percent of current emissions , but still far short of what the eu is proposing and what many scientists say is necessary from the world 's biggest polluter after china .
europe happy to see the back of bush 's climate policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush was seen as no friend of the climate in europe , there is intense relief at the end of the era of former president bush , who abandoned kyoto and opposed binding targets for the us .
despite warm feelings for obama and fear that criticizing him could undermine his domestic position , the eu is also worried that his 2020 goal is just too modest .
" we 're going to tell them that we do n't agree , we think that this is not enough , " said a european negotiator , who argued that japan , canada and other industrialized countries may well take their cues from the us .
alden meyer , a climate expert at the boston-based union of concerted scientists , agrees there has been some critical " blowback " from european nations looking for stronger us efforts .
but he thinks washington may be ready to close the gap on the short-term targets , at least part way .
one reason for obama 's caution , though , is to avoid getting too far ahead of climate and energy legislation taking shape in the us congress .
" what we must avoid - and the obama administration recognizes this - is a repeat of the kyoto situation where the us brought home an international agreement and congress would not ratify it , " said jennifer haverkamp , the top climate expert at the us advocacy group environmental defense fund .
in 1997 , the us senate voted 95-to-0 in a non-binding resolution to reject the new climate treaty as it did not impose commitments on developing countries .
whether or not obama has the power to act on his own , the president has said he will seek approval for his domestic climate plans from the democratic-led congress .
markey 's committee is expected to produce a first draft bill next week and hopes to put legislation before all members of the house by the end of may .
obama faces tough task to convince us but tackling climate change is proving a hard sell domestically for obama as the us economy goes through its deepest recession in decades .
us legislators are not expected to pass legislation forcing companies to lower their emissions before the december summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the us put solving the economic crisis before reducing co2 the argument in the united states has become less about the merits of tackling climate change itself and more about whether pushing green energy solutions will help or hurt economic growth .
obama 's preferred method to cut emissions is a cap-and-trade program , a system that already exists in europe and essentially doles out pollution credits that can be traded between cleaner and dirtier firms .
opposition republicans have lambasted the idea as devastating to us growth , and obama 's budget outline released last month indicated he does n't expect a cap-and-trade plan to be in place until 2012 .
" cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes , killing american jobs , and raising energy costs for consumers , " john boehner , the top republican in the house of representatives said this month .
whether a bill that reduces climate emissions is eventually approved could depend on some key moderate republicans .
obama 's foe during the 2008 election campaign , arizona senator john mccain , is a supporter of cap and trade .
but with many legislators afraid of giving other countries a competitive advantage , success in the us could depend on simultaneous progress internationally .
obama has said he wants to see tough commitments from china , india , and other developing countries that were also left out of the kyoto protocol .
bonn will provide the first opportunity for obama 's team and other countries to flesh out their major disagreements , according to yvo de boer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 28.03.2009 france , germany bolt eu doors to western balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when will the eu open its doors to balkan nations and turkey ?
seven western balkan nations aspiring to join the eu had their hopes dampened by french and german officials reluctant to see the 27-member bloc expanding in times of unfinished inner reforms and global economic crisis . " there will be no enlargement if there is no lisbon treaty , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner on saturday , march 28 , during an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers in the czech republic .
that position was echoed by german foreign ministry officials , who said : " we will not be in a position to accept new member states in the eu without the lisbon treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's bernard kouchner , right , seem to be turning his back to the balkans these comments came after german chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- recently made calls for a pause in the eu 's expansion part of their platform for the upcoming european elections in june .
according to cdu , " the consolidation of the identity and institutions of the european union " must have " precedence over further eu accessions . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to improve the bloc 's decision-making process , taking into account its 2004 and 2007 " big bang " enlargements , which saw a total of 12 new countries join the eu .
however , its enactment has been stalled by an irish no vote in a referendum last year and by this week 's collapse of the czech government before it was able to complete the ratification process .
ireland is now expected to hold a fresh referendum in october , while acting czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg said he was confident that the czech senate would ratify the treaty " in due time . "
sobering news saturday 's comments by top diplomats from france and germany , while not new , were all the more significant as they came during an eu meeting with ministers from seven aspiring members from the western balkans - albania , croatia , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and kosovo - and officials from turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's chief for enlargement , olli rehn , wants to see balkan countries join the bloc german officials said their country 's opposition to further enlargement in the absence of the lisbon treaty also applied to croatia , which is hoping to end its membership talks this year , and become the eu 's 28th member state soon afterwards .
this position was not shared by the eu 's enlargement commissioner , olli rehn .
while acknowledging the need to have the lisbon treaty approved so as to make the eu " more effective , " rehn said enlargement should not be made " a scapegoat for other ills -lrb- that -rrb- it is not responsible for . "
rehn has been spending most of his time trying to advance the case for the western balkans ' eu membership , mediating for instance in a border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia .

despite a severe thalidomide-related physical handicap , the singer has begun taking opera roles in recent years . back in 1977 , the music conservatory in hanover refused to accept the young thomas quasthoff on the grounds that his handicap kept him from playing the piano - a basic requirement for any music student .
instead , quasthoff pursued private voice instruction , which turned out to be to his advantage .
" at the time , it was a big problem , " quasthoff said .
" but in retrospect i can say , it was probably an advantage for me .
because a lot of what is taught at music conservatory is not very important for the career of a singer .
that means people waste a lot of time with things where i think an extra singing lesson or two in the week or in the month would help these students a lot more . "
beyond " beautiful singing " the baritone 's own artistic breakthrough came in 1988 , when he won germany 's renowned ard competition .
since then , he has made countless concert appearances , and has performed with conductors from seiji ozawa and simon rattle to daniel barenboim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff has succeeded despite his disabilities in germany , great lyric baritone singers have been few and far between in the past few decades .
two personalities have dominated the scene : hermann prey and dietrich fischer-dieskau .
prey represented a sort of post-bel canto ideal , bringing the aesthetic dimension of his voice to the fore .
fischer-dieskau , on the other hand , has had a more sober style .
as for quasthoff , he sees himself as the progeny of both of those very different artists , although he admits his artistic vision agrees more with that of fischer-dieskau .
" personally , it is very important to me to have a constant symbiosis between the music and the text , " quasthoff said .
" for me , there is often too much importance put on just ' beautiful singing . " '
focused on the young generation good training for young singers is especially important to quasthoff .
from 1996 to 2004 , he was a voice professor in detmold and , since 2004 , he 's been on the faculty at the prestigious hanns eisler academy of music in berlin .
" i think that in order to be good , in whatever profession , you have to work very hard , " he said .
" success is tied to hard work .
its no different for singers . "
quasthoff remains critical of modern music education .
for example , he says he regrets that bach cantatas and oratorios are so rarely practiced in school , even though they are part of the core concert repertoire .
" in my opinion , that really has to change in the next few years , " he said .
" because we have to admit it - many young people who come out of the conservatory today will have to make careers as concert singers , which is much more difficult than singing opera . "
a love for " lieder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quasthoff , right , was named " singer of the year " in 2004 in addition to oratorios , it 's the art-song genre known as " lieder " that is particularly close to quasthoff 's heart .
" just to give an example , one of the most renowned concert organizers here in berlin does n't have any ' lieder ' concerts on the program this year for the first time since i 've known them , and i think that 's terrible , " the baritone said .
in order to promote the genre among vocal students , quasthoff recently founded an international competition called " das lied . "
despite his fame and tight concert and teaching schedule , music is n't the most important part in quasthoff 's life .
in 2005 , he met the woman who is now his wife , a journalist named claudia .
" i think that people make music differently when they have an inner balance , " he said .
" claudia brings an incredible amount of stability and balance to my life .
i 'm freer , much more relaxed than before , more even-tempered , and only very seldom in a bad mood . "

leader david cameron , shadow chancellor george osborne , and four other shadow cabinet members will address the welsh spring conference .
a show of unity will be key after a controversial reshuffle in wales .
the conservatives are expecting 300 delegates at the swalec stadium in sophia gardens , the second time their conference has been there .
mr cameron will speak on sunday morning , while shadow welsh secretary cheryl gillan , party chairman eric pickles , justice spokesman dominic grieve and work and pensions spokeswoman theresa may will also address the conference over the weekend .
the conservatives have had something of a revival in wales since the early years of tony blair 's government , when they lost all their welsh seats .
in wales they now have three mps , 12 assembly members , and one mep .
shift focus there is confidence in tory ranks they will gain a second welsh seat at the european elections in june .
the candidates on their list are headed by kay swinburne and evan price who are speaking to conference about wales ' role in europe .
other candidates for the tories are emma greenow and david chipp .
they will also be hoping the conference will shift focus away from speculation about divisions within the party .

mr bourne will be giving the closing speech to the conference on sunday at midday .
bbc two wales covers the conference on saturday from 1400 - 1600 gmt and it will be on on s4c from 0955 to 1155 gmt on saturday .

margaret beckett : ' we have to consider how to get back on track ' a government pledge to build three million affordable new homes by 2020 is in trouble because of the recession , the housing minister has said .
margaret beckett said the government must now look at ways to put the programme " back on track " once the downturn comes to an end .
she said the government was doing what it could to help the building industry .
but housing bodies are calling on the government to do more , including invest in the uk 's one million empty homes .
waiting list in 2007 , gordon brown promised to build three million affordable homes to help reduce the housing waiting list , which now stands at nearly five million .
but mrs beckett said of the targets : " they were set because of the predicted levels of household growth - that is not going away .
" so of course we 're in difficulty at the present time because there is very little building .
" but what we have to do now is to consider how we can tackle that , " she told bbc news .
what we 're not going to do is do the jobs that local authorities should be doing margaret beckett , housing minister " now we have to consider when this recession comes to an end , which it will , some day , how can we get back on track . "
richard diment , of the federation of master builders , said it was unlikely the targets would be met .
he said house building was at about 20 % the rate that it was 12 months ago , making it " extremely difficult " to hit the targets .
mrs beckett insisted the government was doing all it could to help , including bringing forward £ 1.2bn of investment in construction , maintenance and repairs .
" we 're doing everything we can to sustain and support -lsb- the construction industry -rsb- .
" we 're working with them to prepare for the upturn when it comes , " she added .
the royal institute of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- suggested the only way to deal with the current housing problem was to renovate empty homes .
simon rubinsohn , of rics , said : " while it 's understandable that the government may not feel that this is the easiest way and perhaps the most opportune way of actually dealing with the problem , ultimately i think probably in the short-term , it is the only way . "
david ireland , head of the campaign group empty houses agency , said the recession meant homes that became empty were staying empty .

empty homes ' important ' to scheme he urged for policy change to ensure any investment was correctly targeted and called for housing associations to shift their focus from new builds to regeneration .
sir bob kerslake , chief executive of the government 's homes and communities agency , accepted the government should be doing what it could to put empty properties back into use .
but he said they were empty for a number of reasons , including probate or refurbishment and about half were occupied again within six months .
margaret beckett said if there were empty homes the government could help , but urged the local authorities to do more to find them and make them habitable .
" what we 're not going to do is do the jobs that local authorities should be doing .

margaret beckett : ' we have to consider how to get back on track ' a government pledge to build three million affordable new homes by 2020 is in trouble because of the recession , the housing minister has said .
margaret beckett said the government must now look at ways to put the programme " back on track " once the downturn comes to an end .
she said the government was doing what it could to help the building industry .
but housing bodies are calling on the government to do more , including invest in the uk 's one million empty homes .
waiting list in 2007 , gordon brown promised to build three million affordable homes to help reduce the housing waiting list , which now stands at nearly five million .
but mrs beckett said of the targets : " they were set because of the predicted levels of household growth - that is not going away .
" so of course we 're in difficulty at the present time because there is very little building .
" but what we have to do now is to consider how we can tackle that , " she told bbc news .
what we 're not going to do is do the jobs that local authorities should be doing margaret beckett , housing minister " now we have to consider when this recession comes to an end , which it will , some day , how can we get back on track . "
richard diment , of the federation of master builders , said it was unlikely the targets would be met .
he said house building was at about 20 % the rate that it was 12 months ago , making it " extremely difficult " to hit the targets .
mrs beckett insisted the government was doing all it could to help , including bringing forward £ 1.2bn of investment in construction , maintenance and repairs .
" we 're doing everything we can to sustain and support -lsb- the construction industry -rsb- .
" we 're working with them to prepare for the upturn when it comes , " she added .
the royal institute of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- suggested the only way to deal with the current housing problem was to renovate empty homes .
simon rubinsohn , of rics , said : " while it 's understandable that the government may not feel that this is the easiest way and perhaps the most opportune way of actually dealing with the problem , ultimately i think probably in the short-term , it is the only way . "
david ireland , head of the campaign group empty houses agency , said the recession meant homes that became empty were staying empty .

margaret beckett said if there were empty homes the government could help , but urged the local authorities to do more to find them and make them habitable .

margaret beckett : ' we have to consider how to get back on track ' a government pledge to build three million affordable new homes by 2020 is in trouble because of the recession , the housing minister has said .
margaret beckett said the government must now look at ways to put the programme " back on track " once the downturn comes to an end .
she said the government was doing what it could to help the building industry .
but housing bodies are calling on the government to do more , including invest in the uk 's one million empty homes .
waiting list in 2007 , gordon brown promised to build three million affordable homes to help reduce the housing waiting list , which now stands at nearly five million .
but mrs beckett said of the targets : " they were set because of the predicted levels of household growth - that is not going away .
" so of course we 're in difficulty at the present time because there is very little building .
" but what we have to do now is to consider how we can tackle that , " she told bbc news .
what we 're not going to do is do the jobs that local authorities should be doing margaret beckett , housing minister " now we have to consider when this recession comes to an end , which it will , some day , how can we get back on track . "
richard diment , of the federation of master builders , said it was unlikely the targets would be met .
he said house building was at about 20 % the rate that it was 12 months ago , making it " extremely difficult " to hit the targets .
mrs beckett insisted the government was doing all it could to help , including bringing forward £ 1.2bn of investment in construction , maintenance and repairs .
" we 're doing everything we can to sustain and support -lsb- the construction industry -rsb- .
" we 're working with them to prepare for the upturn when it comes , " she added .
