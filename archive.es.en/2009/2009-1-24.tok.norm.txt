some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .

better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .

" asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .

next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .

" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .
but while slashing germany 's 2009 growth forecast to a 2.25-percent contraction , german economic and technology minister michael glos said : " we will see a change for the better during the second half .

conditions at the center have been criticized by the un and germany . police said the group forced open the gates of the camp and then peacefully marched to the center of town , where they began protesting their detention . the police were far outnumbered by the migrants , who marched through the streets toward city hall showing " freedom , help us ! " several hundred local residents joined in the demonstration , calling for the inmates to be transferred to bigger camps in other locations in italy .
locals have protested italy 's plans to build another center on the island to identify and expel illegal immigrants . they said it would turn italy 's southernmost island into a " sort of prison " rather than a humanitarian center for refugees rescued at sea . poor conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants at the lampedusa center the refugee center is overflowing with nearly 2,000 people , who were brought there by italian authorities after being picked up or rescued trying to cross the mediterranean from africa to europe . the camp was originally intended to be a temporary stop until those held would be transferred to other centers .
but under italy 's strict new immigration rules , people are held at lempedusa until granted asylum or expelled . conditions at the camp have deteriorated due to the overflow , with hundreds of people forced to sleep outdoors under tents .
the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 24.01.2009 in us , penny-pinching consumers boost german discounter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recession and belt-tightening in the us is benefiting discounter aldi the economic downturn in the united states has provided a huge opportunity for germany 's discount retailer aldi to extend its influence in a market not usually known for its frugal consumers . at first glance , it 's hard to imagine aldi appealing to the mainstream american tastes .
the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "

the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .

24 . germany welcomed on friday plans by us president barack obama to close the camp , but has not yet offered to accept detainees .
spiegel said france had sent the plan to eu capitals and would discuss it when eu foreign ministers meet on monday in brussels .
eu nations are divided about whether to admit the detainees , described by us authorities as not dangerous .
portugal and france appear willing while sweden and the netherlands have said no .
germany still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , would like to help out us president barack obama germany 's government is itself split over the issue .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor of hosting inmates , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against such a move .
talks on the subject are scheduled between the two ministers , who are eager to score political points ahead of a general election looming in germany later in the year .
former german-turkish guantanamo detainee murat kurnaz , who was able to return to germany after more than four years of captivity , called friday on the government to show " active regret " for failing to act quicker in his case .
case by case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu governments have been in favor of closing the guantanamo camp for years spiegel said the french plan was for each nation to decide on a case-by-case basis who to take in , with eu funds available to give traumatized former detainees psychological counseling .
non-eu states such as norway and switzerland would also be contacted about taking in inmates .
european governments have been calling for the us camp , known for its aggressive interrogation methods , to be closed for years .
it has held more than 750 captives from around the world since opening in 2002 , most of them without trial .
both the french and the german foreign ministers have so far declined to comment on the spiegel report .
personal opinion european commission president jose manuel barroso on friday told reporters it was up to eu members to help the us solve the problem of the guantanamo facility .
" i think the eu member states - of course it is their decision - could make an effort to help the united states , " barroso said .
but he also said that this was his personal opinion and that there had been no debate in brussels on the topic .

the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "
while many retailers have feared americans would stay away from stores which cut down on their service offerings , consultant hertel said americans are not as pampered as conventional wisdom has it .
after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .
“ in a recession good value at the lowest price trumps all other factors in luring shoppers , ” he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "
while many retailers have feared americans would stay away from stores which cut down on their service offerings , consultant hertel said americans are not as pampered as conventional wisdom has it .
after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .

conditions at the center have been criticized by the un and germany . police said the group forced open the gates of the camp and then peacefully marched to the center of town , where they began protesting their detention . the police were far outnumbered by the migrants , who marched through the streets toward city hall showing " freedom , help us ! " several hundred local residents joined in the demonstration , calling for the inmates to be transferred to bigger camps in other locations in italy .
locals have protested italy 's plans to build another center on the island to identify and expel illegal immigrants . they said it would turn italy 's southernmost island into a " sort of prison " rather than a humanitarian center for refugees rescued at sea . poor conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants at the lampedusa center the refugee center is overflowing with nearly 2,000 people , who were brought there by italian authorities after being picked up or rescued trying to cross the mediterranean from africa to europe . the camp was originally intended to be a temporary stop until those held would be transferred to other centers .
but under italy 's strict new immigration rules , people are held at lempedusa until granted asylum or expelled . conditions at the camp have deteriorated due to the overflow , with hundreds of people forced to sleep outdoors under tents .
the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 . germany welcomed on friday plans by us president barack obama to close the camp , but has not yet offered to accept detainees .
spiegel said france had sent the plan to eu capitals and would discuss it when eu foreign ministers meet on monday in brussels .
eu nations are divided about whether to admit the detainees , described by us authorities as not dangerous .
portugal and france appear willing while sweden and the netherlands have said no .
germany still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , would like to help out us president barack obama germany 's government is itself split over the issue .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor of hosting inmates , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against such a move .
talks on the subject are scheduled between the two ministers , who are eager to score political points ahead of a general election looming in germany later in the year .
former german-turkish guantanamo detainee murat kurnaz , who was able to return to germany after more than four years of captivity , called friday on the government to show " active regret " for failing to act quicker in his case .
case by case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu governments have been in favor of closing the guantanamo camp for years spiegel said the french plan was for each nation to decide on a case-by-case basis who to take in , with eu funds available to give traumatized former detainees psychological counseling .
non-eu states such as norway and switzerland would also be contacted about taking in inmates .
european governments have been calling for the us camp , known for its aggressive interrogation methods , to be closed for years .
it has held more than 750 captives from around the world since opening in 2002 , most of them without trial .
both the french and the german foreign ministers have so far declined to comment on the spiegel report .
personal opinion european commission president jose manuel barroso on friday told reporters it was up to eu members to help the us solve the problem of the guantanamo facility .
" i think the eu member states - of course it is their decision - could make an effort to help the united states , " barroso said .
but he also said that this was his personal opinion and that there had been no debate in brussels on the topic .
barroso also welcomed president barack obama 's decision to close the prison within 12 months . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .

“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "
while many retailers have feared americans would stay away from stores which cut down on their service offerings , consultant hertel said americans are not as pampered as conventional wisdom has it .
after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .

the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .

and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .

conditions at the center have been criticized by the un and germany . police said the group forced open the gates of the camp and then peacefully marched to the center of town , where they began protesting their detention . the police were far outnumbered by the migrants , who marched through the streets toward city hall showing " freedom , help us ! " several hundred local residents joined in the demonstration , calling for the inmates to be transferred to bigger camps in other locations in italy .
locals have protested italy 's plans to build another center on the island to identify and expel illegal immigrants . they said it would turn italy 's southernmost island into a " sort of prison " rather than a humanitarian center for refugees rescued at sea . poor conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants at the lampedusa center the refugee center is overflowing with nearly 2,000 people , who were brought there by italian authorities after being picked up or rescued trying to cross the mediterranean from africa to europe . the camp was originally intended to be a temporary stop until those held would be transferred to other centers .
but under italy 's strict new immigration rules , people are held at lempedusa until granted asylum or expelled . conditions at the camp have deteriorated due to the overflow , with hundreds of people forced to sleep outdoors under tents .
the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .
but while slashing germany 's 2009 growth forecast to a 2.25-percent contraction , german economic and technology minister michael glos said : " we will see a change for the better during the second half .

the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "
while many retailers have feared americans would stay away from stores which cut down on their service offerings , consultant hertel said americans are not as pampered as conventional wisdom has it .
after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .

the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 24.01.2009 in us , penny-pinching consumers boost german discounter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recession and belt-tightening in the us is benefiting discounter aldi the economic downturn in the united states has provided a huge opportunity for germany 's discount retailer aldi to extend its influence in a market not usually known for its frugal consumers . at first glance , it 's hard to imagine aldi appealing to the mainstream american tastes .
the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "
while many retailers have feared americans would stay away from stores which cut down on their service offerings , consultant hertel said americans are not as pampered as conventional wisdom has it .
after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .
“ in a recession good value at the lowest price trumps all other factors in luring shoppers , ” he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .
but while slashing germany 's 2009 growth forecast to a 2.25-percent contraction , german economic and technology minister michael glos said : " we will see a change for the better during the second half .

analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .

" in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "

after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock exchanges around the world are regularly posting losses in addition , investors are bracing themselves for what is likely to be a gruesome fourth-quarter corporate reporting season with share markets keenly waiting to see how leading european companies see their business year unfolding .
earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .
but while slashing germany 's 2009 growth forecast to a 2.25-percent contraction , german economic and technology minister michael glos said : " we will see a change for the better during the second half .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .

the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .

better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .

" asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .

conditions at the center have been criticized by the un and germany . police said the group forced open the gates of the camp and then peacefully marched to the center of town , where they began protesting their detention . the police were far outnumbered by the migrants , who marched through the streets toward city hall showing " freedom , help us ! " several hundred local residents joined in the demonstration , calling for the inmates to be transferred to bigger camps in other locations in italy .
locals have protested italy 's plans to build another center on the island to identify and expel illegal immigrants . they said it would turn italy 's southernmost island into a " sort of prison " rather than a humanitarian center for refugees rescued at sea . poor conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants at the lampedusa center the refugee center is overflowing with nearly 2,000 people , who were brought there by italian authorities after being picked up or rescued trying to cross the mediterranean from africa to europe . the camp was originally intended to be a temporary stop until those held would be transferred to other centers .
but under italy 's strict new immigration rules , people are held at lempedusa until granted asylum or expelled . conditions at the camp have deteriorated due to the overflow , with hundreds of people forced to sleep outdoors under tents .
the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "
only a temporary uptick ?
the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has not been able to escape the global economic slowdown euro membership might have helped currency bloc nations to ward off an economic meltdown as the global slowdown has gained momentum .
but membership has also meant that countries hit hard by the economic crisis have been unable to lay the foundations for recovery by allowing falling national currencies to boost exports .
the european commission also warned this week that slowing economic growth and increased government spending could mean budget deficits will balloon across the euro zone this year , which in turn could add to the economic strains threatening the currency bloc .
next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland used to be booming , but now its banks are in trouble " friday 's pmis were just the beginning of another batch of confidence indicators , " said ing 's brzeski .
" it is very likely that the stabilization of the situation will be confirmed . "
another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .
the zew index also measures economic sentiment over a six-month timeframe .
banking sector causes concern but franz went on to say : " these expectations have to be seen against the background of the current economic situation which is assessed to have deteriorated further this month . "
indeed , the release of the latest economic sentiment surveys came amid fresh evidence of the continuing turmoil in the global banking sector and the rapid contraction in world economic growth .

earlier in the week , the european commission revised down sharply its 2009 growth outlook for the euro zone saying it expects currency bloc 's economy to shrink 1.9 per cent this year before growing by a meager 0.4 percent in 2010 .

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .
23 , with the release of two key euro-zone indicators .
better times ahead ?
the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro zone countries are in it together - for better or worse " was this the bottom ? " asked ing economist carsten brzeski following the release of the pmis , which came amid the release of a slew of key economic sentiment indicators .
many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "

the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .

next week is critical a major test of the economic mood in the euro zone is likely to come next tuesday with the release of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence survey , which plummeted in december to a low last seen during the 1980s oil crisis .
a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .
but many analysts believe the component , gauging expectations for the world 's top exporting nation six months down the track , could rise slightly this month .

another key indicator released this week showed german investor confidence jumping more than expected in january on hopes of the economic recovery starting to take shape as the year unfolds .
" the financial analysts share the optimism of recent economic forecasts predicting that economic perspectives should improve from the middle of this year , " said center for european economic research chief wolfgang franz on releasing the survey .

24 . germany welcomed on friday plans by us president barack obama to close the camp , but has not yet offered to accept detainees .
spiegel said france had sent the plan to eu capitals and would discuss it when eu foreign ministers meet on monday in brussels .
eu nations are divided about whether to admit the detainees , described by us authorities as not dangerous .
portugal and france appear willing while sweden and the netherlands have said no .
germany still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , would like to help out us president barack obama germany 's government is itself split over the issue .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor of hosting inmates , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against such a move .
talks on the subject are scheduled between the two ministers , who are eager to score political points ahead of a general election looming in germany later in the year .
former german-turkish guantanamo detainee murat kurnaz , who was able to return to germany after more than four years of captivity , called friday on the government to show " active regret " for failing to act quicker in his case .
case by case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu governments have been in favor of closing the guantanamo camp for years spiegel said the french plan was for each nation to decide on a case-by-case basis who to take in , with eu funds available to give traumatized former detainees psychological counseling .
non-eu states such as norway and switzerland would also be contacted about taking in inmates .
european governments have been calling for the us camp , known for its aggressive interrogation methods , to be closed for years .
it has held more than 750 captives from around the world since opening in 2002 , most of them without trial .
both the french and the german foreign ministers have so far declined to comment on the spiegel report .
personal opinion european commission president jose manuel barroso on friday told reporters it was up to eu members to help the us solve the problem of the guantanamo facility .
" i think the eu member states - of course it is their decision - could make an effort to help the united states , " barroso said .
but he also said that this was his personal opinion and that there had been no debate in brussels on the topic .
barroso also welcomed president barack obama 's decision to close the prison within 12 months . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conditions at the center have been criticized by the un and germany . police said the group forced open the gates of the camp and then peacefully marched to the center of town , where they began protesting their detention . the police were far outnumbered by the migrants , who marched through the streets toward city hall showing " freedom , help us ! " several hundred local residents joined in the demonstration , calling for the inmates to be transferred to bigger camps in other locations in italy .
locals have protested italy 's plans to build another center on the island to identify and expel illegal immigrants . they said it would turn italy 's southernmost island into a " sort of prison " rather than a humanitarian center for refugees rescued at sea . poor conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants at the lampedusa center the refugee center is overflowing with nearly 2,000 people , who were brought there by italian authorities after being picked up or rescued trying to cross the mediterranean from africa to europe . the camp was originally intended to be a temporary stop until those held would be transferred to other centers .
but under italy 's strict new immigration rules , people are held at lempedusa until granted asylum or expelled . conditions at the camp have deteriorated due to the overflow , with hundreds of people forced to sleep outdoors under tents .
the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 . germany welcomed on friday plans by us president barack obama to close the camp , but has not yet offered to accept detainees .
spiegel said france had sent the plan to eu capitals and would discuss it when eu foreign ministers meet on monday in brussels .
eu nations are divided about whether to admit the detainees , described by us authorities as not dangerous .
portugal and france appear willing while sweden and the netherlands have said no .
germany still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , would like to help out us president barack obama germany 's government is itself split over the issue .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor of hosting inmates , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against such a move .
talks on the subject are scheduled between the two ministers , who are eager to score political points ahead of a general election looming in germany later in the year .
former german-turkish guantanamo detainee murat kurnaz , who was able to return to germany after more than four years of captivity , called friday on the government to show " active regret " for failing to act quicker in his case .
case by case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu governments have been in favor of closing the guantanamo camp for years spiegel said the french plan was for each nation to decide on a case-by-case basis who to take in , with eu funds available to give traumatized former detainees psychological counseling .
non-eu states such as norway and switzerland would also be contacted about taking in inmates .
european governments have been calling for the us camp , known for its aggressive interrogation methods , to be closed for years .
it has held more than 750 captives from around the world since opening in 2002 , most of them without trial .
both the french and the german foreign ministers have so far declined to comment on the spiegel report .
personal opinion european commission president jose manuel barroso on friday told reporters it was up to eu members to help the us solve the problem of the guantanamo facility .
" i think the eu member states - of course it is their decision - could make an effort to help the united states , " barroso said .
but he also said that this was his personal opinion and that there had been no debate in brussels on the topic .
barroso also welcomed president barack obama 's decision to close the prison within 12 months . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 24.01.2009 in us , penny-pinching consumers boost german discounter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recession and belt-tightening in the us is benefiting discounter aldi the economic downturn in the united states has provided a huge opportunity for germany 's discount retailer aldi to extend its influence in a market not usually known for its frugal consumers . at first glance , it 's hard to imagine aldi appealing to the mainstream american tastes .
the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .

success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .

" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .

the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "
while many retailers have feared americans would stay away from stores which cut down on their service offerings , consultant hertel said americans are not as pampered as conventional wisdom has it .
after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .

conditions at the center have been criticized by the un and germany . police said the group forced open the gates of the camp and then peacefully marched to the center of town , where they began protesting their detention . the police were far outnumbered by the migrants , who marched through the streets toward city hall showing " freedom , help us ! " several hundred local residents joined in the demonstration , calling for the inmates to be transferred to bigger camps in other locations in italy .
locals have protested italy 's plans to build another center on the island to identify and expel illegal immigrants . they said it would turn italy 's southernmost island into a " sort of prison " rather than a humanitarian center for refugees rescued at sea . poor conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants at the lampedusa center the refugee center is overflowing with nearly 2,000 people , who were brought there by italian authorities after being picked up or rescued trying to cross the mediterranean from africa to europe . the camp was originally intended to be a temporary stop until those held would be transferred to other centers .
but under italy 's strict new immigration rules , people are held at lempedusa until granted asylum or expelled . conditions at the camp have deteriorated due to the overflow , with hundreds of people forced to sleep outdoors under tents .
the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some financial analysts believe that europe might have reached its economic low point , with recovery on the way .
but economists say they are waiting for some key statistics which will be released next week . the 16-member euro zone might still be in the grip of a severe economic slump , but signs have emerged that the downturn that has engulfed the currency bloc in recent months could be reaching its low point .
the latest batch of evidence that the round of hefty global interest rate cuts , falling oil prices and government stimulus packages are helping to raise hopes of an economic pickup later in the year came friday , jan .

the purchasing managers ' indices -lrb- pmis -rrb- for the euro zone 's manufacturing and service sectors posted surprise increases in january .
additionally , belgium 's key economic sentiment indicator rose slightly this month , ending four months of steep falls .
analysts had forecast a decline in the indicator .

many economists believe that the euro zone economy possibly reached its nadir as 2008 came to a close and expect the currency bloc to gain traction in the second half of the year before experiencing a recovery in 2010 .
" the low point in the cycle is now , " said rainer guntermann , senior euro-zone economist with the investment house dresdner kleinwort .
" there is a bit of a feeling of a turning point . "

the risk is that the improvement in the indicators could be temporary , while the roll call of bleak economic data combined with dire corporate earnings reports appears set to continue in the coming months .
coinciding with this are likely to be growing tensions in the currency bloc as a result of the dramatic turnaround in the economic performance of several member states such as spain , ireland , italy and greece .

a sharp fall in the index 's component measuring the current business climate in europe 's biggest economy is expected to result in the ifo edging down again in january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.01.2009 france reportedly drafts eu plan for guantanamo inmates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the destiny of the remaining guantanamo detainees is still unclear france has drafted a plan for eu nations to take in 60 of 245 detainees remaining at the united states ' guantanamo bay prison camp on cuba , german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday , jan .
24 . germany welcomed on friday plans by us president barack obama to close the camp , but has not yet offered to accept detainees .
spiegel said france had sent the plan to eu capitals and would discuss it when eu foreign ministers meet on monday in brussels .
eu nations are divided about whether to admit the detainees , described by us authorities as not dangerous .
portugal and france appear willing while sweden and the netherlands have said no .
germany still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , would like to help out us president barack obama germany 's government is itself split over the issue .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor of hosting inmates , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against such a move .
talks on the subject are scheduled between the two ministers , who are eager to score political points ahead of a general election looming in germany later in the year .
former german-turkish guantanamo detainee murat kurnaz , who was able to return to germany after more than four years of captivity , called friday on the government to show " active regret " for failing to act quicker in his case .
case by case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu governments have been in favor of closing the guantanamo camp for years spiegel said the french plan was for each nation to decide on a case-by-case basis who to take in , with eu funds available to give traumatized former detainees psychological counseling .

24 . germany welcomed on friday plans by us president barack obama to close the camp , but has not yet offered to accept detainees .
spiegel said france had sent the plan to eu capitals and would discuss it when eu foreign ministers meet on monday in brussels .
eu nations are divided about whether to admit the detainees , described by us authorities as not dangerous .
portugal and france appear willing while sweden and the netherlands have said no .
germany still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , would like to help out us president barack obama germany 's government is itself split over the issue .
while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , is in favor of hosting inmates , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a conservative , is against such a move .
talks on the subject are scheduled between the two ministers , who are eager to score political points ahead of a general election looming in germany later in the year .
former german-turkish guantanamo detainee murat kurnaz , who was able to return to germany after more than four years of captivity , called friday on the government to show " active regret " for failing to act quicker in his case .
case by case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu governments have been in favor of closing the guantanamo camp for years spiegel said the french plan was for each nation to decide on a case-by-case basis who to take in , with eu funds available to give traumatized former detainees psychological counseling .
non-eu states such as norway and switzerland would also be contacted about taking in inmates .

the discounter chain 's decor is spartan .
its narrow product range with goods stacked in cardboard boxes on loading pallets gives its stores a warehouse look .
in a nation where the customer is king , aldi supermarkets offer little in the way of service .
shoppers need to deposit a quarter to get a shopping cart , bag their own groceries in plastic sacks that cost a dime each and pay in cash .
the no-nonsense cashiers have no time for pleasantries and scan the items faster than customers can load groceries into the shopping cart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "
while many retailers have feared americans would stay away from stores which cut down on their service offerings , consultant hertel said americans are not as pampered as conventional wisdom has it .
after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .
“ in a recession good value at the lowest price trumps all other factors in luring shoppers , ” he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's sliding economy is forcing its consumers to change their habits but those consumer attitudes are changing as the us economy takes a battering , leading to bankruptcies and job losses and forcing americans to rein in their spending .
and as america 's economic fortunes flag , aldi 's are picking up .
analysts say the recession is providing the ideal climate for the privately owned german chain to flourish across the atlantic .
" the recession is driving shoppers into aldi 's arms .
americans are sitting on a big pile of debt , the jobless rate is going up and unemployment benefits are meager , so whether the weekly grocery bill ends up being $ 120 or $ 100 makes a big difference now , " said boris planer , a retailing analyst at planetretail in frankfurt .
success in germany , unknown in us with an estimated 51.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- global turnover , aldi is a huge success in germany .
over 90 percent of all households shop at one of its 4,000 stores nationwide .
but the going has n't been that easy for the discounter in the us despite its reputation for offering surprisingly high-quality goods for low prices . since 1976 , aldi has been operating nearly 1,000 discount supermarkets from kansas to the east coast , but it 's only in the last few years that the retailer has achieved double-digit growth in the us .
meanwhile traditional supermarkets have grown an average of only three percent , according to estimates by chicago-based willard bishop consulting .
last week , aldi 's us division announced its new expansion with 75 stores opening this year at a time when many other retailers are going out of business .
aldi 's rock bottom prices that undercut other big us discounters such as wal-mart and target by sometimes as much as 20 percent are the key attraction , according to planer .
american retail habits changing however , juergen elfers , a european retail expert at commerzbank corporates and markets in frankfurt says that american customers are not exactly flocking to the aldi stores yet and it is taking a long time for its concept to gain acceptance in the us .
" aldi is a still niche market in us food retailing .
they 've been in the us market for 30 years already and only have 1,000 stores - that 's not a screaming success story , " elfers said .
aldi accounts for only about one percent of the entire $ 900 billion food-retailing sector , according to jim hertel , managing partner of willard bishop consulting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say us consumers are increasingly going for low-price retail options but the global slowdown is slowly but surely changing american retail attitudes , other analysts point out , making consumers previously wary about no-name private grocers adopt a more open attitude toward low-price shopping options .
“ private labels used to have a reputation of being cheap , but of poor quality .
now the quality and perception of quality have improved to aldi 's benefit .
then add factors like inflation in the last year and the recession .
the convergence of all these factors are opening up peoples ' minds to aldi , ” hertel said . now that even investment bankers are finding themselves on the dole , americans are becoming more like germans in terms of being price conscious and ecologically minded , according to planer . " in germany , everyone from millionaires to the social welfare recipient shops at discount stores .
the poor have to shop there , but the rich folks like aldi because it 's possible to get good quality at a low price , " said planer .
" aldi stands for simple life " aldi has also worked to remake its image across the atlantic , making an effort to promote its good-value-for-money concept .
whereas the discounter previously appealed to mainly low-income groups in the us , the firm is now starting to move aggressively into upper-middle class neighborhoods , where the stores are getting a facelift - wider aisles , more light and brighter color schemes - to appeal to a more upscale clientele .
" conspicuous consumption is out .
aldi stands for the simple life where it 's possible to get the essentials at the lowest prices , " said planer .
" even the sale of reusable shopping bags has been phenomenal . "

after all , he pointed out , they gave up full-service gas stations for lower cost self-service pumps .
according to retail analyst planer , the sheer size of the us market means that if only a portion of consumers decided to give up service and convenience for lower prices , discount retailers could still see big benefits , especially in this time of global financial crisis .

conditions at the center have been criticized by the un and germany . police said the group forced open the gates of the camp and then peacefully marched to the center of town , where they began protesting their detention . the police were far outnumbered by the migrants , who marched through the streets toward city hall showing " freedom , help us ! " several hundred local residents joined in the demonstration , calling for the inmates to be transferred to bigger camps in other locations in italy .
locals have protested italy 's plans to build another center on the island to identify and expel illegal immigrants . they said it would turn italy 's southernmost island into a " sort of prison " rather than a humanitarian center for refugees rescued at sea . poor conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants at the lampedusa center the refugee center is overflowing with nearly 2,000 people , who were brought there by italian authorities after being picked up or rescued trying to cross the mediterranean from africa to europe . the camp was originally intended to be a temporary stop until those held would be transferred to other centers .
but under italy 's strict new immigration rules , people are held at lempedusa until granted asylum or expelled . conditions at the camp have deteriorated due to the overflow , with hundreds of people forced to sleep outdoors under tents .
the un refugee agency unhcr , in a rare criticism of italy , called it a " difficult humanitarian situation . "
the un body said the camp was designed to accommodate 850 people . italy 's interior ministry estimates that 31,700 immigrants landed on lampedusa in 2008 , a 75 percent increase on the previous year . according to unhcr , preliminary figures for 2008 showed that about 75 percent of those who arrived in italy by sea last year applied for asylum . bildunterschrift : making the dangerous journey toward europe german criticism alexander graf lambsdorff , a german legislator , assailed italy on friday over the " terrible " accommodation for refugees at a camp on the island . speaking on the rbb radioeins radio station , the european parliament member said more than 1,800 people were being housed in a camp with only about 800 beds . " the situation in this utterly overcrowded camp is terrible , " he said .
he said he could not understand why the italian government was not providing additional sites to house them . " i think it 's their expression of a stubborn , ideologically blinkered , conservative immigration policy , " said lambsdorff , 42 , who is a member of the free democratic party . he said the treatment fell short of the european union 's minimum standards about how to treat immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the country was taking back control of its natural resources " little by little " .

chaco , which was a subsidiary of the british oil company , bp , had been in talks with the government about the transfer of shares , but negotiations broke down .

speaking inside the chaco offices , mr morales said his government " will respect private investment as long as they respect bolivian norms . "
" we want partners , not bosses , " he added .
the new constitution would entrench state control of the economy and give more power to bolivia 's poor indigenous communities .

president evo morales flew to a natural gas field in central bolivia to order the immediate nationalisation of chaco energy company .
he said the country was taking back control of its natural resources " little by little " .
troops earlier occupied all the company 's offices and installations .
chaco , which was a subsidiary of the british oil company , bp , had been in talks with the government about the transfer of shares , but negotiations broke down .
opposition politicians described the move as a political manoeuvre , coming just two days before a hotly contested referendum on a new constitution that would consolidate state control over the economy .
president morales has already nationalised most of the energy industry and has promised to take over other sectors of the economy as well .
speaking inside the chaco offices , mr morales said his government " will respect private investment as long as they respect bolivian norms . "
" we want partners , not bosses , " he added .
the new constitution would entrench state control of the economy and give more power to bolivia 's poor indigenous communities .

ffos-y-fran opencast mine is on a hill overlooking merthyr tydfil , with the nearest houses about 40m away .
life in the shadow of the ffos-y-fran opencast mine is a depressing one say many of the residents there .
mother-of-two alyson austin says she wakes up every morning feeling sick , dreading what the day could bring and whether the noise of machinery will start at 7am .
terry evans , who lives nearby , says he is glad the weather has been cold and damp for so long - he says when the sun comes out , the dust gets worse .
another neighbour , vivienne hadley is angry .
she believes her son 's asthma has got worse and that nobody is listening to her concerns .
pensioner leon stansfield sums up their feelings : " it 's like when you wake up on a bright summer 's day , you feel uplifted .
but for us , it 's like waking up on a damp , dismal day every day . "
the residents say the mine is already a " huge hole " and will get bigger they are all residents who once lived in what they described as the " peaceful , clean and safe " community of twynyrodyn , merthyr tydfil .
that changed when the go-ahead was given for what will become one of europe 's biggest opencast mining sites .
workers at ffos-y-fran will mine 10m tonnes of coal over 17 years on a hilly site that overlooks the town centre .
despite numerous court battles , a public inquiry , petitions and protests , work started at the site around 18 months ago .
the closest houses are about 40m -lrb- 132ft -rrb- away from the site - despite residents calling for a 500m -lrb- 1,640ft -rrb- buffer zone - and there are schools and a nursery nearby .
my son is asthmatic and i 've noticed an increase in his asthma and hay fever attacks alison austin on tuesday , environment minister jane davidson announced that the new assembly government planning advice for coal mines will include a 500m buffer zone .
but for the residents living in the shadow of ffos-y-fran , the new regulation will not make any difference .
the assembly government says it will not be retrospective and that the planning permission given to miller argent - the company which runs ffos-y-fran - will not change .
miller argent said it doubted the new rule would have applied to ffos-y-fran because it is built on reclaimed land , which can be exempt from the new rule .
it is the latest disappointment for the residents .
" we do n't live now , we exist , " said mrs austin , who lives about 400m -lrb- 1,320ft -rrb- away from the site .
the opencast mine is sited on a hill above homes and schools " i wake up at 6.30am and keep waiting for the drone of the machines , which start at about that time every day .
sometimes the noise comes , sometimes it does n't , depending on the weather conditions .
" but you have that sick dread feeling about what the day 's going to bring .
the noise we 're getting is from the excavators .
it 's a low-pitched drone that throbs within the house , especially upstairs .
" downstairs you ca n't have a quiet room .
i have got to have the tv or radio on otherwise the noise drives me mad .
on top of that you have an aircraft rushing noise where the shovels are moving .
" it goes on from 7am to 10pm monday to friday and on saturday , it goes from 7am to 5pm .
" very often we get woken up on a saturday morning and i get so angry .
" moving 's not an option .
my house has gone down in value and there are no viewings on my estate . "
we have only had four complaints so far in january and we take all complaints seriously stephen tillman , miller argent residents say dust is another problem , despite assurances from miller argent that this has been addressed with water bowsers .
people living there say they often find residue from the mining on their homes and cars , especially after it has rained .
roy jones , chairman of swansea friends of the earth , which has supported the residents , said : " the one thing i 'm concerned about is the health effects .
it 's not what we see - the dust you can wipe off windows .
" but it 's the small particles which you breathe in .
we 're concerned about what you ca n't see . "
both mrs austin and mrs hadley claim they have seen an increase in their children 's asthma .
" my son has asthma and i 've done a lot of work with action for asthma in merthyr , " said mrs hadley .
" the dust is in the air .
my son has has had problems with wheezing . "
terry evans has taken pictures of what he believes to be dust from the mine mrs austin added : " my son is asthmatic and i 've noticed an increase in his asthma and hay fever attacks .
" and my daughter 's had a cough for a year . "
after moving to the area from pontypridd , she decided not to enrol her children - aged 12 and 10 - at the school .
" i travel 30 miles in a round trip to take them to pontypridd because at least then for eight hours a day i have taken them out of the dusty environment , " she said .
mr evans , who lives closest to the mine 40m away , is angry for his paraplegic wife , pamela , who stays inside the house most days .
" i can get out for a few hours but she has to sit in the house with the windows closed , " he added .
a journey up the hill where diggers and lorries are working at the mine is now " heartbreaking " for some .
" i remember coming here for picnics and to fly kites , " said elizabeth condron , who has led a campaign against the mine .
miller argent , which own the mine , says it employs about 200 people " but now i do n't like to come up here .
it 's a huge hole already and it 's going to get much bigger . "
stephen tillman , joint managing director for miller argent , said he had " sympathy " for the residents but said the firm has been continuously working with the community .
" they have been impacted by the noise and although we 're within the noise limits , we are doing further things to reduce it , like trying new acoustic kits , " he said .
" in terms of dust , we have water bowsers and we have doubled the water bowser fleet to help .
" we have only had four complaints so far in january and we take all complaints seriously .
" i think it 's important to say that we employ around 200 people , of which 75 % are from the local area . "
an assembly government spokesman said : " welsh ministers have been asked previously to revoke the planning permission granted for the ffos-y-fran scheme or to modify it to introduce a 500m buffer zone but declined to do so . "

" we do n't live now , we exist , " said mrs austin , who lives about 400m -lrb- 1,320ft -rrb- away from the site .
the opencast mine is sited on a hill above homes and schools " i wake up at 6.30am and keep waiting for the drone of the machines , which start at about that time every day .
sometimes the noise comes , sometimes it does n't , depending on the weather conditions .
" but you have that sick dread feeling about what the day 's going to bring .
the noise we 're getting is from the excavators .
it 's a low-pitched drone that throbs within the house , especially upstairs .
" downstairs you ca n't have a quiet room .
i have got to have the tv or radio on otherwise the noise drives me mad .
on top of that you have an aircraft rushing noise where the shovels are moving .
" it goes on from 7am to 10pm monday to friday and on saturday , it goes from 7am to 5pm .
" very often we get woken up on a saturday morning and i get so angry .
" moving 's not an option .
my house has gone down in value and there are no viewings on my estate . "
we have only had four complaints so far in january and we take all complaints seriously stephen tillman , miller argent residents say dust is another problem , despite assurances from miller argent that this has been addressed with water bowsers .
people living there say they often find residue from the mining on their homes and cars , especially after it has rained .
roy jones , chairman of swansea friends of the earth , which has supported the residents , said : " the one thing i 'm concerned about is the health effects .
it 's not what we see - the dust you can wipe off windows .
" but it 's the small particles which you breathe in .
we 're concerned about what you ca n't see . "
both mrs austin and mrs hadley claim they have seen an increase in their children 's asthma .
" my son has asthma and i 've done a lot of work with action for asthma in merthyr , " said mrs hadley .
" the dust is in the air .
my son has has had problems with wheezing . "
terry evans has taken pictures of what he believes to be dust from the mine mrs austin added : " my son is asthmatic and i 've noticed an increase in his asthma and hay fever attacks .
" and my daughter 's had a cough for a year . "
after moving to the area from pontypridd , she decided not to enrol her children - aged 12 and 10 - at the school .
" i travel 30 miles in a round trip to take them to pontypridd because at least then for eight hours a day i have taken them out of the dusty environment , " she said .
mr evans , who lives closest to the mine 40m away , is angry for his paraplegic wife , pamela , who stays inside the house most days .
" i can get out for a few hours but she has to sit in the house with the windows closed , " he added .
a journey up the hill where diggers and lorries are working at the mine is now " heartbreaking " for some .
" i remember coming here for picnics and to fly kites , " said elizabeth condron , who has led a campaign against the mine .
miller argent , which own the mine , says it employs about 200 people " but now i do n't like to come up here .
it 's a huge hole already and it 's going to get much bigger . "
stephen tillman , joint managing director for miller argent , said he had " sympathy " for the residents but said the firm has been continuously working with the community .
" they have been impacted by the noise and although we 're within the noise limits , we are doing further things to reduce it , like trying new acoustic kits , " he said .
" in terms of dust , we have water bowsers and we have doubled the water bowser fleet to help .
" we have only had four complaints so far in january and we take all complaints seriously .
" i think it 's important to say that we employ around 200 people , of which 75 % are from the local area . "
an assembly government spokesman said : " welsh ministers have been asked previously to revoke the planning permission granted for the ffos-y-fran scheme or to modify it to introduce a 500m buffer zone but declined to do so . "

we have only had four complaints so far in january and we take all complaints seriously stephen tillman , miller argent residents say dust is another problem , despite assurances from miller argent that this has been addressed with water bowsers .
people living there say they often find residue from the mining on their homes and cars , especially after it has rained .
roy jones , chairman of swansea friends of the earth , which has supported the residents , said : " the one thing i 'm concerned about is the health effects .
it 's not what we see - the dust you can wipe off windows .
" but it 's the small particles which you breathe in .
we 're concerned about what you ca n't see . "
both mrs austin and mrs hadley claim they have seen an increase in their children 's asthma .
" my son has asthma and i 've done a lot of work with action for asthma in merthyr , " said mrs hadley .
" the dust is in the air .
my son has has had problems with wheezing . "
terry evans has taken pictures of what he believes to be dust from the mine mrs austin added : " my son is asthmatic and i 've noticed an increase in his asthma and hay fever attacks .
" and my daughter 's had a cough for a year . "
after moving to the area from pontypridd , she decided not to enrol her children - aged 12 and 10 - at the school .
" i travel 30 miles in a round trip to take them to pontypridd because at least then for eight hours a day i have taken them out of the dusty environment , " she said .
mr evans , who lives closest to the mine 40m away , is angry for his paraplegic wife , pamela , who stays inside the house most days .
" i can get out for a few hours but she has to sit in the house with the windows closed , " he added .
a journey up the hill where diggers and lorries are working at the mine is now " heartbreaking " for some .
" i remember coming here for picnics and to fly kites , " said elizabeth condron , who has led a campaign against the mine .
miller argent , which own the mine , says it employs about 200 people " but now i do n't like to come up here .
it 's a huge hole already and it 's going to get much bigger . "
stephen tillman , joint managing director for miller argent , said he had " sympathy " for the residents but said the firm has been continuously working with the community .
" they have been impacted by the noise and although we 're within the noise limits , we are doing further things to reduce it , like trying new acoustic kits , " he said .
" in terms of dust , we have water bowsers and we have doubled the water bowser fleet to help .
" we have only had four complaints so far in january and we take all complaints seriously .
" i think it 's important to say that we employ around 200 people , of which 75 % are from the local area . "
an assembly government spokesman said : " welsh ministers have been asked previously to revoke the planning permission granted for the ffos-y-fran scheme or to modify it to introduce a 500m buffer zone but declined to do so . "

the environment agency is refurbishing the existing flood defences along the river nene in wisbech .
a drop-in session by the agency on 28 january will also detail plans for the next phase of work starting next month .
the work aims to reduce the risk of flooding to nearly 10,500 homes and more than 1,200 businesses .
road closures the next stage is expected to take 10 months , and will involve strengthening the existing defences by attaching specially constructed buttresses to the existing walls and repairing the brickwork where required .
environment agency project manager andrew rouse said : " the next stage of the work will mean more road closures , as unfortunately the type of refurbishment work required to repair the flood defences means we have to use large machinery .
" we hope as many residents as possible affected by the next stage of work can come to the drop-in sessions so that we can answer any questions they have . "
the sessions are being held at national trust 's peckover house , reed barn , from 1200 to 1400 gmt and 1500 until 1900 gmt .
